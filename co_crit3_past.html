Firstly I went to see my GP because of sever back pain. I was tested for a kidney infection but it came back clear. I was also referred to a physiotherapist at Nottingham County Council through work. I feel I was not correctly diagnosed by the doctors and I continued going to physiotherapy. The doctor did no tests to check if I had prostate cancer. \r\n\r\nMy pain got sever and I collapsed. I was taken into QMC Nottingham where I had an MRI scan. They found that I had prostate cancer which had spread to my spine. A tumor was trapping my spinal cord! I had several large operations whilst I was in hospital for several months.\r\n\r\nI now have to go to a spinal clinic every couple of months in the Urology department. I have to also see a psychiatrist because I have lost my job and can no longer play golf or tennis. I feel like I have been cheated because the GP failed to diagnose my cancer earlier. I feel like my life has been ruined just before my retirement. I am now fighting for compensation with the help of my solicitors. I have also changed doctors to Musters Medical Practice where I obtained a Patient Opinion leaflet. My previous GP has now resigned with no explanation why. I know wonder whether it is because of my mis-diagnoses. \r\n\r\nI feel very angry that it was not picked up early before the cancer had spread to his spine. If I was in so much pain, the doctor should have carried out a thorough checkup to find the cause. This has left me with no job, no chance of taking part in hobbies and I know find it difficult to walk. I feel all of this could have been avoided if I had been cared for properly. Nonetheless, the hospital care was very good, but obviously I feel it has come too late to really prevent the cancer from spreading to my spine. I was 59years old when this happened and I feel like I have lost the last years of retirement which I was very much looking forward to.", "My wife underwent surgery at Sheffield Northern General Hospital in July 2008, to replace a leaking aortic valve.

Surely my wife should have received the care she needed on either the Coronary Care, Intensive Care or Stroke Unit. Although the nursing staff on ward 18 were wonderful, and I feel that I could single some individuals out by name for even higher praise, I do not think that my wife received the proper care she required while on ward 18. \r\nUnfortunately, after gradual deterioration and despite fighting her illness, my wife passed away whilst still on ward 18 earlier this month.\r\nI am extremely upset and feel cheated of what should have been a happy time during the twilight years of our lives.

I want to give the care I was trained to do .. and that is to a high standard.\r\nBut it seems since 'Trusts' were made things have gone down hill.\r\nThere is more emphasis on spending and saving money.. than the reason we are there...you can not put a price on patient care.\r\nThe fact is there arent enough staff on duty..ever.. there are vacancies that arent being filled due to poor pay. and the low standards in patient care isnt helped by the high number of agency staff. These are not employed by the trust and therefore continuity of care is none exsistant.\r\nToo much emphasis is put on saving money.. staff cuts.. medicine cuts.\r\nThe government targets forcing A&E patients out of A&E before the 4 hour target, not only compromises patient saftey but also increases work load on A&E and the wards. the government penalise Trusts if they dont meet these targets but cant they see the bigger picture .\r\nLack of respect for patients and staff from the nurses and doctors doesnt help. \r\n\r\nThe programme dispatches tonight made me feel ashamed to be a nurse..

I am a caring person and when i hear of nurses ignoring or mistreating patients it makes me embarrassed for them. \r\n\r\nOld Style NHS has a lot to answer for.. the patient was number one.. as it should be today!!!", "My elderly (94) Mum passed away on 10th March 2009. On the morning of her hospital admission some four weeks earlier, I had washed and dressed her and supervised her descent downstairs. She then used her zimmer to sit in an armchair and as normal she chose to have a bit of a nap whilst I did other things. \r\nAfter half an hour later I tried to wake her but she was very slow to come round and her speech was mumbled and something was clearly the matter so I called an ambulance. At A+E she was more her usual self though over the previous weeks her appetite was poor and she needed lots of encouragement to drink tea/water.\r\nAt A+E Mum's vital signs and ECG readings were fine(Two months earlier her own Doctor had stated that apart from a little murmur her heart, B.P., lungs, kidneys, cholestorol and blood sugar were fine and within normal limits. Mum had been treated for Thrush(down below) and had recently had a suppository for constipation.\r\nThe hospital decided her only problem was dehydration and put her on an IV drip, which remained in situ for the next three weeks. She was not catheterised until the last few days. Some days she was left in bed, other days she was sat out. They decided to prescribe anti-depressants as a possible reason for poor appetite. I visited twice a day and mostly managed to get Mum to take two Ensure plus drinks and small amounts of home-made food. She started to communicate more spontaneously and we duetted in singing 'Early One Morning' (a home favourite).\r\nHowever, I voiced my concerns about swelling in her limbs but a Registered Nurse told me that this was nothing to worry about and was normal for someone whose body had been lacking food and fluid. A few days later I queried a noticeable 'wheeze' but the ward doctor ignored this and was more concerned about how I would manage Mum at home, now that she was not weight-bearing very well, having had no physio. Two days later I insisted she needed to be examined and the same Doctor then said \"She's got a bit of a wheeze\". \r\nThe following day I met with the Consultant and his Registrar and they said the plan was for Mum to come home the next week and that no chest infection had been found. Prior to this I had reported that Mum was severely constipated and insisted that an enema was necessary. Her tummy was also very distended. A micro-enema was administered with little result and a stronger enema was prescribed on 3rd March but this was never administered due to Mum's gradual deterioration. \r\nThe next day I was advised that Mum did, after all, have a slight chest infection and she commenced with anti-biotics though the following day these were withdrawn when an infection was not the cause of her poor health but closer examination of a chest X-ray revealed \"sticky-blood\" around the heart. \r\nThat weekend a Staff Nurse admitted to me that Mum's condition was due to fluid overload, apparently she had developed Pulmonary Oedema and suffered a \"cardiac event\" overnight. When I broached this with the Consultant he changed the subject and was more concerned that I accept his colleague's decision to flag-up as Do Not Resuscitate. I was devastated. \r\nOn Mum's final day, it was obvious she was in extreme pain and I insisted she be given some pain relief. The Doctor asked her if she was in pain but stoically she said \"No\" and chose not to prescribe anything. But I had seen her wince and cry out in pain and it wasn't until five hours later that a Nurse actually heard Mum cry out that this Nurse managed to persuade the Doctor to give Mum some Oromorphine. A few hours later Mum passed away following a final stronger dose of morphine. Cause of Death is shown as cardiac failure and myocardial infarction.\r\nSorry, this has been so long-winded but I need to know if fluid overload is a common occurrence and is it irreversible? What sort of questions I need to be asking when I seek answers from the hospital authorities? Any advice or help you think might be relevant?

For the past years, it is very well known that our trust is not performing well. However, this is getting worse lately and has since had a detrimental effect on the patient's care. That's why I decided to share my concern here and hope that someone external can do something about this trust. I am not too sure what can be done to improve the current situation although the front line staffs like myself are doing what we can to help the patients.\r\nCurrently, we have a waiting list of 15+patients waiting to be admitted into acute inpatient bed for their mental health needs. All of these patients are acutely unwell, vunerable and present a significant risk to themselves and others. Most of them have been reviewed by two medical officers and both officers had completed medical recommendation to `section' the patient into a psychiatric hospital. However, in order to complete the `section' (Mental Health Act), the patients will need to be reviewed by the Approved Social Worker or AMP within the 14 days after the medical recommendation. There is a catch 22 here whereby the AMP can't complete the section unless there is a bed available for the patients to be `sectioned' into. Since there is no bed in the trust most of the time, these patients who are acutely unwell and present a risk to themselves/others are being left in the community and continue to present a risk to themselves, public and particularly their family members.\r\nLately, the situation has gone worse lately when the trust has been unable to locate a bed for more than 14 days and the medical recommendation are lapsing which means the patients have remained in the community for more than 14 days and their mental health continues to deteriote since their mental health needs are not being met. It is a matter of time someone is going to get hurt and it is either a member of public or the patients themselves. This is unacceptable and dangerous considering the trust couldn't identify a bed within 14 days for patients who need immediate hospital admission to prevent harm to themselves and others. In fact, lately, we had a patient sadly passed away while waiting for hospital admission. This patient was too seen by both medical officers and was recommended to be `sectioned' into hospital. His death may not be related to his mental health but If he was to be admitted into a hospital immediately or witin a reasonable time scale, his death can most likely to be prevented.\r\nI hope someone from the Department of Health/media is reading this and decided to do something about this. For anyone who knows anyone who is on the `waiting list', I will advise them the only way to get immediate hospital admission is through A&E since the trust will only take this seriously when they get `fined' for not able to locate a bed within 4 hours (compared to 14 days in the community). If the patient refused and is in a public place, please get the police to use their power sec 136 to convey the patient to a place of safety rather than being left in the community/family home.", "We are grateful for the opportunity to comment on this issue as we have been trying hard to provide speedy access to everyone who needs a period of treatment in the hospital. We all recognise that this is a particularly difficult time for both the person needing to be in hospital and their relatives and friends, and that any delay to the admission is an added stress. \r\nTo try and ensure that there is as little delay as possible in getting into the wards, we manage the beds across the city from a dedicated bed management team.\r\nRecently there has been some changes and disruption to the bed management team and this, combined with very heavy demand for in-patient treatment, has resulted in some delays in getting immediate access.\r\nWe have strengthened the bed management team by introducing a senior manager and we have seen a reduction in the delays in admitting people as a result. \r\nHowever there are occasions when it is unavoidable that there will be people on a waiting list for admission. In these circumstances we regularly review the circumstances and needs of those patients and ensure additional support for them in the community so that their needs are met in the most effective manner until a bed can be identified in the Trust or elsewhere. Today we are looking for beds for two people.\r\nAs a Trust we really want to be able to provide the best quality of services we can and so we need to hear of any problems as early as possible.

He was admitted in June with a stroke, he died after suffering badly.\r\n\r\nParalysed down one side and blind, his meals were left untouched.  Liquids, so important once he had contracted C-Diff, were left unopened (in the case of the nutritional meal supplement), or too far to reach in the case of the water jug.  In either case he could not see them, and could not have reached them as he was immobile.  He complained that he was lying in his own excrement, it was heart wrenching.  He often cried.\r\n\r\nMy mother and I eventually caught up with the Doctor who agreed that in the circumstances a drip would be an ideal and desirable solution.  The next day we were delighted to see a drip installed, but it was empty.  We never visited Dad to find the drip anything other than empty, and we do not know, to this day when or if that drip ever got changed, despite constant reminders to any nurse not too busy to listen to us to change it.\r\n\r\nNursing was not in evidence.  Everyone was too busy to answer our anxious queries, or clustered round the nurses station chatting.  We took food in, we made sure Dad drank, but it broke our hearts to hear him say how much pain he was in, and nothing seemed to be done for it.\r\n\r\nAs visitors we had to wear a plastic apron and use hand gel.  But nurses and administrators often came in lacking either.  Visitors' toilets were often overflowing with dirty paper towels and obviously were not cleaned regularly.  We worried for the lack of hygiene.\r\n\r\nDad recovered (or did he?) from his first bout of C-Diff and was moved to a geriatric ward where plans were made for his release home.  Within a week he contracted C-Diff again, and died.  Me and my siblings desperately wanted to put in an official complaint, but my mother would not hear of it, being in deepest grief after 63 years of marriage to a wonderful man.

I could not move without the help of a \"monkey ring\", was left lying in the bed. I had bed sores within 24 hours.  My son insisted that I be moved to an orthopaedic ward. I was moved after three days, in great pain.  The DVT stockings had not been replaced after the operation and I developed DVT. After 5 days I had a pulmonary thrombosis in the middle of the night. The response to this was very quick and very efficient and I know that they saved my life, but I am sure that I would not have developed this if my nursing care immediately after the operation had been adequate. I then became very anaemic. A family member (a practioner nurse) drew their attention to my low blood count, as no one else appeared to have noticed. I was then given a blood transfusion.

He was then found acting strangely on a beach in East Sussex, picked up by the police and returned to his psychiatrist under section. Although we hadn't seen him since October 2005, because the place of safety was a police station, we were unable to see him again, or given any information about where he was returned to. He then turned up at my mum's flat and decided to stay in our locality. In spite of our concerns about his mental health, he was discharged from the London borough as not needing psychiatric services as he DNA (did not attend) a clinic appointment even though he was on strong drugs. There was no handover to local psychiatric services in spite asking for this. He had a stash of drugs, got more from his new GP and committed suicide in June 2006.\n\nAfter his suicide his psychiatrist from London contacted my mother and myself, which seemed to be a process of passing on the blame from himself in case we made a complaint.

The issue here is probably all around risk assessment \u2013 sadly sometimes we assess risk as low but it can change rapidly for some people and lead them to suicide.  Transfers should involve families unless there is a good reason not to as they provide valuable perspectives for us when working with someone new and the trust has made public commitments to involving carers in care planning.\r\n\r\nGood CPA, competent risk assessment and carer involvement are all factors that may have been helpful here, but it is difficult to judge on scant information.

I was sent home after having an operation to repair my fracture but whilst I was on the ward I contracted an infection.\r\n\r\nI was cared for by Community nurses while at home and they informed me that the wound had not been closed properly and that was the cause of the infection.

The consultant informed me that I should have been seen by the hospital at least twice before today and he subsequently apologized for the hospital failings.\r\n\r\nI am totally disgusted by the treatment I have received from the hospital and intend to persue this matter further.", "I believe that incompetence, negligence, and lack of communication with relatives (carers) and GP over a period of nearly 5 years, resulted in my son (aged 29) taking his own life while suffering from schizophrenia. Actions by some practitioners were counter-productive, in my view, and served to work against best outcome.\r\n\r\nI was exasperated by the internal investigation, which left my questions and concerns unanswered. In my view it did not address the failings of systems and individuals concerned, as far as I could tell. I felt that the official complaints procedure was slow, poorly executed, and the result not fit for purpose. For instance, in the clear-cut mishandled situations it appeared to me that staff suspensions were called-for, to highlight the blatant - and simple - failings in interaction, recording, following-up, and following through with care.\r\n\r\nI am so embittered that in my view just a little effort and diligence by people in the Trust (BSMHT), and by the GPs involved, could have saved our loved son from suicide, but they appear to have little real comprehension of their failings - and still less of Customer Service: the concept of that is alien.\r\n\r\nI have had to request an independent review by the Parliamentary Ombudsman for Health to look into failings by this Trust, and my son's GP who, in effect, was responsible for managing this case. Incompetence and simple human negligence prevailed, in my opinion; and my son, after years of efforts to keep fit and motivated, slid into a terrible depressive state in which he thought only he had the answer. We so miss him.\r\n", "I was extremely disappointed to hear about your experience. Without knowing the specifics of your case, it is difficult to comment. However it is unacceptable that as a patient with diabetes you were not provided with support to manage your condition. The Trust has a very experienced team of Diabetes Specialist Nurses, and a referral to this team should have been made. I apologise if this was not undertaken.  Extensive research suggests that patients with diabetes are more prone to infection and wound healing may take longer. May I reassure you that had there been evidence of any infection, a high temperature or a dirty wound at the time we were due to go home, your discharge would not have taken place. \r\n\r\nWhen a patient fractures their hip there are two ways that it may be fixed. The surgeon would have chosen the most appropriate way depending on a number of factors. A fracture of this kind can take up to 6 months to heal properly, although inevitably there will be a degree of leg shortening. I do apologise if this was not fully explained to you. \r\n\r\nThe follow up arrangements including an Out Patient appointment are patient specific and dependent upon factors such as the cause of the fracture and the age of the patient.

She refused to follow my birth plan (despite there being no danger to my baby) she scolded me for making noise as i was bearing down and pretty much ignored me or left me alone most of the time. except to tell me off.\r\n\r\ni was a young girl of 17 at the time and didn't argue with her as i wasn't aware of my rights. i spent the majority of the birth in silence, so as not to prevoke her.\r\n\r\nI gave birth to a large baby weighing 10lb, I tore REALLY badly upward, leaving half of my labia and clitoris hanging away from my body. (there were many other issues too, but i shall not go into them now) The midwife at the time, told me I had a small tear and not to be a baby, for some reason she did not stitch me up. I have had to have 3 repair ops and 2 blasts of plastic surgery to try and rectify some of the damage. I still have more to go, and now, with my second child, I am having to have a c-section, as another birth may un-do the work done. The experience left me severely traumatised and it has taken 9 years to come to terms with it and consider having more children.\r\n\r\nThe after care was alot better. The staff were really busy, but tried their best to accomodate everyones needs as best as they could. One evening my baby wouldn't sleep and because i was so exausted, they took him off my hands and cared for him, so I could grab a couple of hours.\r\nThey supported me with breastfeeding, encouraged me and praised me as a new mother.

Due to a s35 warrant signed by a justice of the peace who had never seen me, the police x2, my consultant and my social worker refused to respect my wishes.\r\n\r\n  They claimed they wanted to chat.  As soon as they had entry by putting in my front door, I was taken handcuffed to a police car - having done nothing wrong.  My door was then left open to whomsoever attended the scene - I did not know them from Adam.\r\n\r\n  I was then taken to the Royal Edinburgh Hospital and sectioned. In my view my human rights were completely abused by the justice of the peace signing away my rights without my ability to represent myself or organise someone to represent me.  Furthermore, I can only do so \"on appeal\" rather than prima facia.  My right to freedom of expression was not respected.  My right to privacy was not respected.  My right to not be deprived of liberty was not respected.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my opinion at the Appeal hearing, I was not allowed to speak even with my citing the human rights act and article 6.  At the CTO hearing I was allowed to speak having specifically requested this in documentation.  However, my consultant had refused me access to a computer  the day before the hearing as a pass, even although I had four hour passes and weekend passes and a week pass over Xmas, with no issues arising.\r\n\r\n  The day of the CTO hearing I managed to get off ward to a computer and emailed 4 documents for the hearing arriving at about 11.30 am.  The hearing was at 2.00 pm.  My documents did not reach the Chairperson, nor lay representatives for the hearing and I only had copies of one document sent by email to give at the 2.00 pm hearing.\r\n\r\n  My human rights were abused by my Consultant and this I feel is consistent with his conduct towards me over 8 years.  The Mental Care and Treatment (Scotland) Act 2003 requires non-discriminatory practises, reciprocity and other principles - none, I feel are afforded to me. \r\n\r\n I have now moved area, which means a change of consultant, however, I am worried that my medical records are so misconstrued as to be falsely recorded.\r\n\r\n  My consultant is also required to provide me with a report for a court case for personal injury - he is refusing to do so because he normally liaises with a solicitor acting for me, in my case I am both the patient and litigant in person.\r\n\r\n  My case has been delayed for 6 years because of what I feel is his nonsense and he is effectively obstructing/perverting the course of justice and is acting in complicity with judge and respondents' solicitors on the case.\r\n\r\n  Whilst I was generally treated well by staff at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital, they are not autonomous.

Having received no contact from BEH my GP sent yet another referral, again no response! I contacted PALS and 8 weeks following the initial referral I was invited to attend the Denis Scott unit and saw a person, who asked a series of questions which I answered. At no point did he enquire about the obsessive tendencies I had experienced or suicidal thoughts which I was increasingly experiencing.\r\n\r\nFour weeks following this 'assessment' I called the Denis Scott unit & spoke to a person who advised there had been a delay in dispatching correspondence and I should hear from the unit in a fortnight. As a Medical Secretary I understood the pressures on the admin staff however 4 weeks following my conversation, I called the unit again only to be told that my case had been reviewed by the clinician and deemed to be 'inappropriate'! To add insult to injury the correspondence advising the PCT, GP & myself had never been dispatched.\r\n\r\nIt was now FOUR MONTHS since initial referral from my GP. During this time my condition had worsened and due to to bereavement and further isolation I am increasingly considering suicide (which scares me). After four months and countless calls, each time I am advised someone will call me back, including the complaints department. I even called the Chief Executive's office & spoke to a person who took my details & advised she would arrange for someone in the Denis Scott unit to call me back that very day but no call was received.\r\nI am no further to receiving the care I need. Instead I was advised to call Barnet Mind who simply advise there is a three month waiting list for counselling!

These were printed out on a single sheet of paper.\r\nThis, together with the written report were handed over to A&E - but have mysteriously gone missing. By then, my AF had ended, and so the tracings done in the hospital showed nothing but normal rythym.

The fact that you are undergoing counselling as a consequence of the care received is deeply concerning.\r\nYour feedback will help us to further raise awareness amongst the staff about how important their individual care and attitude is. Overall there is a theme of a lack of empathy for you as a new mother and this is not an attitude we can tolerate.\r\nTreating women with compassion and respect is fundamental to the provision of good care. However you have shown vividly that we have staff whose attitude and behaviour clearly do not meet the expected standards. Providing a high standard of care on the postnatal ward is a challenge for many maternity units, and is the area which women are most likely to describe in negative terms.

Because of my friend's advancing years, though they has been in very good health all their life, I feel they have been pushed aside with respect to quality health care and support.\r\nIn my opinion this should have been detected much much sooner than it was with a chance that the diagnosis would not have been so severe and certain as it is now.\r\nFor me, regardless of how a GP reacts, how busy they are, and all the mundane reasons patients are given in times of crises, it is the GP's responsibility to ensure he/she provides the best guidance and direction for their patients based on the information at hand and the longevity of a particular symptom(s).\r\nIn my opinion this situation fell through the cracks.

We were told the next day cancer had spread all through his abdomen. He died 7mths later...aged 53yrs. The consultant never even came to tell us they sent his registrar, they also never discussed the treatment with us. they made no attempt to explain anything until I lodged a complaint. Nearly 2yrs on and I'm still waiting for answers. I think this is disgusting.", "The following is the story of my son, Joshua\r\n\r\nTowards the end of October my wife had been feeling unwell for 2 or 3 days with a headache and sore throat. At around 9pm, her waters broke. This was nearly 3 weeks away from her due date. My mum advised us to phone the hospital which we did. \r\n\r\nAt the maternity ward we told the midwife that my wife was feeling unwell and described the symptoms very clearly. We repeatedly mentioned the illness and even discussed the concern that she may have caught something from our daughter, who had been very sick earlier in the week\r\n\r\nWe were given some advice and then discharged about an hour later and told to return anytime after 10am the next day.\r\n\r\nWith still no sign of labour the following day, at about 11.30am, we returned to the hospital. We explained that my wife was still feeling ill, tired and had a sore throat and headache. \r\n\r\nAt the hospital, she was monitored for contractions (still none) and given blood pressure and temperature checks.  We were later discharged and told that if the contractions hadn't started earlier to come back on Monday morning. \r\n\r\nMy wife started to have painful contractions at about 5.30am the next day. We phoned the ward and were told to wait until the contractions became more regular and intense. This seemed to happen very quickly. At about 6.15am we phoned and informed the ward that we were coming in.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Furness General at about 6.30am. Her contractions were very painful and intense. At 7.38am, our son Joshua was born. \r\n\r\nWe  may never truly understand what happened next, but in summary, not long after the birth, my wife collapsed with infection. Her temperature went to 39.2 and she developed rigours. She was given intravenous antibiotics and paracetamol and made a recovery over the next few hours. Although we were concerned for Joshua, we were reassured that he was fine. At around midday, we were transferred to the maternity ward. At this point we were told that the paediatrician had been contacted but they were \u2018very busy' but that Joshua would be monitored closely.\r\n\r\nThrough out the day and night, Joshua was monitored by various midwifes. He was mucousy, wheezy and reluctant to feed. We were told all these things were \u2018normal.' He had his temperature monitored and on several occasions his temperature was so low that he was placed on a heated cot to warm up. At one stage, he was placed on a headed cot and an overhead heater was placed directly over his body. At two o'clock in the morning, my wife rang the emergency bell by her bed because Joshua was making \u2018grunting' sounds and was breathing very rapidly. A midwife came and took Joshua out the room and returned him around 30 minutes later, again reassuring us that Joshua was fine.\r\n\r\nAt around 8am in the morning, my wife found Joshua collapsed in his cot, he was blue and saliva bubbles were coming out of his mouth. At this point, he was transferred to SCBU and was seen by a very shocked paediatrician for the first time.  \r\n\r\nJoshua had acquired the same infection as my wife. We now know that low temperature is an indicator of infection in neonates. Joshua spent 9 days fighting for his life but eventually died whilst receiving specialist intensive care in Newcastle. He died from internal bleeding from his left lung which had rotten due to his untreated infection. The consultant in Newcastle said that they had never seen lung necrosis in a neonate to the extent that Joshua endured.\r\n\r\nSadly, following Joshua death, his observation chart, which was the only record of his postnatal care, has been \u2018lost' and in my opinion the staff have not reported a truthful sequence of events.\r\n\r\nDespite this, there have been many changes to the maternity service at FGH since Joshua died and I am confident that the unit is now a safe place for others to have a baby.\r\n", "My story of being told my Atrial Fibrillation was harmless and then being told that my heart rate was normal when I was having a heart attack.  Then being told by another hospital that I had not had a heart attack.  My extreme chest pain being ignored. Being asked why was I playing the system by a nurse. Then being disbelieved when I found an alternative medication that actually worked.\r\n\r\nI have suffered from Atrial Fibrillation for most of my adult life and was constantly told by my GP that it was harmless.  But one day on the golf course last year my AF went out of control. I drove myself to the nearest hospital and presented myself at the A&E where I was told my heart rate was normal.  I insisted (being quite ill) and the nurse agreed to do an ECG.  This showed my heart rate to be 215. So much for the accuracy of the heart rate monitor she used on me the first time.  The nurse called in the resuss team by computer link and the next thing I was told I would shortly have a feeling of impending doom as a doctor unloaded a syringe of unknown fluid into my arm which was apparently designed to stop my heart for a moment. The nurse leaned over me and whispered \"You were right to come in to the hospital\". They took several hours trying to reduce my heart rate and I spent 5 days in the cardiac ward. I was told that I had had a Myocardial Infarction after tests had shown that damage had occurred.\r\nI was allowed to shower before going home and I felt very ill from the physical exertion just from having a shower.  This I was told was totally normal for heart attack patients.\r\n\r\nThis was not my local hospital so when I returned home I switched to my own hospital for tests.  This hospital decided that I had not had a heart attack at all and I was fine. Despite the fact that I could hardly climb the stairs at home. They took me off of the drugs and one week later I was back in A&E at my local hospital having been taken there by Emergency Ambulance.  This happened about 5 times in all and a 5 day stay in the cardiac ward was the highlight.  During that time I had extreme chest pains which lasted from midnight to dawn and I had to sit in a chair all night with oxygen.  According to the specialists I saw I was quite healthy.  A nurse even asked me why I was playing the system. (As if I would have put my health at risk by being in hospital other than for a genuine reason)\r\n\r\nI finally decided to try to work out what was happening for myself and realised by a process of elimination that while I was in hospital I was being injected with Heparin but when they sent me home that was the only drug I was not on.  I asked my specialist to be put on heparin and he agreed but only for  a couple of months.  After a few adjustments to the dose I was feeling much better.  Then after a couple of months my specialist wanted to take me off of the heparin because he could not find anything wrong with me. I managed to persuade him to keep me on heparin but 3 days before Christmas his secretary told me that I could no longer have any more heparin and that was final.  In my opinion the heparin was keeping me out of hospital. I didn't want to die so I phoned the police and they said they wouldn't do anything because it was a health matter.  So I wrote a letter to the chief executive of the local heath trust and within hours I was told I could be prescribed heparin by my local GP no problem.\r\nI could not stay on heparin for much longer due to possible side effects but luckily for me by chance I found an alternative form of blood thinning pill.\r\n\r\nI now feel fitter than any time in the last 20 years and I have had very few AF attacks and none for the last 3 months.  All my other symptoms have gone and I can play golf better than before. I have to be careful not to suddenly stress my heart but apart from that so far I am doing fine on my self prescribed alternative to Heparin.\r\nI must continue with the pills because having missed a dose or two I found my symptoms coming back again. I am having trouble convincing the medics that it actually works but I am from a very technical background where results are everything. I may be making some progress convincing them but there is huge resistance to new ideas in the NHS. There are many theories from doctors as to why what I am taking cannot work but the results show that for me it really does work.  I would not be paying 90 pounds a month if it did not work and all my friends know I am not renowned for spending money unwisely. Results are everything, theories are theories. That is Science.\r\n\r\nMy work involved diagnosis of technical problems and trouble shooting to the highest level and at one time I was in charge of protecting a major UK University's computers from attack by computer viruses. There were 60,000 different viruses at the time.  There are now around 300,000 computer viruses at large so I am glad I do not have to do that anymore!  I also designed an immune system for data disks.  If you don't think data disks can be given an immune system then think again.  So there was a striking similarity between my old job and what the NHS does.\r\n", "We are very sorry that in our original comment we said that you had met with the Trust on several occasions when in fact you have only just met with members of staff.

Best wishes,", "I want to raise a concern about the procedure undertaken in theatre before having my hip replacement.\r\nI think it is almost abuse to be catheterised in front of male staff, while even a male member of staff was watching and decided he would inform me that this was the most embarrasing part of the proceedure.\r\nHow unprofessional is that for a hospital that claims to protect dignity? I am so disgusted that my hope is I never have to have another operation at Ormskirk Hospital.\r\nAlso the nurses seem only to congregate at the nurses station rather than observing patients needs on the ward. What an awfull experience it was.", "I took my daughter of 13 months to Whiston A&E after my doctor referred her, as she couldn't walk properly and her knee was hot and swollen.\r\nI sat there for about 2 hours before a doctor saw her. She was then asked to go for a scan and then come back to discuss the results. \r\nWhen i came back with her they said she was fine and couldn't find nothing and she was getting referred to Alder Hey. So i left and waited. \r\nI called 2 days later to find out whether she had an appointment made but they said to phone Alder Hey. I phoned Alder Hey who had no record of an appt to be made.\r\nI then waited another day and finally decided to take her to Alder Hey as she was really distressed and refused to walk or move her leg. Later that evening she was admitted to Alder Hey with a bad case of septic arthritis and we spent a week there.\r\nHow could the doctors in A&E miss this? I am not going to Whiston again, who knows what they could miss next time?", "I was taken to an admissions unit under a section 136. I was there for a total of 6 hours. For the first 3 hours, I sat calmly causing no problems at all waiting to be assessed by a doctor and a social worker. Staff supervised me while I waited to be assessed and in my opinion, I gave no cause for concern. \r\nAfter 3 hours, new staff started their shift. One of the senior members of staff on the unit came into the 136 suite and asked for my shoes which had laces and any property I had. I said I had caused no problems thus far but still handed over my property. They asked if I had a phone. I explained that I had an iPhone and that I didn't feel comfortable handing it over. I explained again that I had not caused any problems for the past 3 hours, that it was not possible to harm myself with a phone, and that, being a \u00a3600 phone, I would not even contemplate damaging it. They began shouting at me, and speaking down to me. At no point did I become violent towards them or raise my voice, which is not what I can say for them. \r\nBecause I would not hand over my phone, they called for the response team which consisted of three males and two female staff. Two men came from behind and held me down. They all held my legs and my arms while one person retrieved my phone. I began struggling, screaming at them that this was not necessary. Even after they had taken my phone, they still restrained me. I continued to struggle. They then began pulling at my trousers. I screamed \"What are you doing?\". My trousers were pulled down to just above my knees. I continued screaming, asking what they were doing. They said nothing. They then held me down to the floor, put my hands behind my back pointing upwards and held me there for a minute, my trousers still around my knees. Then a staff member said \"are we finished?\" and they all let go of me. I immediately pulled my trousers up. The whole restraint lasted about 5 minutes, though they had taken my phone within the first 30 seconds. In my opinion, they enjoyed restraining me and seeing me struggle.\r\nAs soon as the restraint had ended I immediately began to have a panic attack. I have a history of sexual assault and what they had just done, and the fact that my trousers had been pulled down, brought everything to the surface. I began to cry frantically, hyperventilating and shaking. I was cowering in the corner. The staff began to laugh out loud at me. They stayed there for a further 5 minutes watching me in distress and they were laughing. They left apart from two staff who stayed to supervise me. \r\nAfter about 20 minutes I was still having a panic attack, my chest began to hurt, I was having difficulties breathing and hyperventilating, my heart was palpitating and I couldn't feel my hands or feet. I was terrified. I asked the two staff to get a doctor. They replied by saying that I was being silly, and that I was doing this to myself. I begged them to get a doctor.  \r\nThey then said we'll take your blood pressure and vital signs. I screamed at them that I didn't want them to touch me, and asked them again to get a doctor. They didn't. They said I'd been sitting there quietly (which I clearly wasn't), and that I could wait for the psychiatrist. I told them I wanted a medical doctor and told them about the chest pains. I then heard one of them say they needed to cover their backs and they then got the a senior member of staff, the same one who called the response team earlier. \r\nThis member of staff came in and began shouting at me telling me to stop being silly and that the doctor (psychiatrist) was on their way. \r\nI asked for a medical doctor. The member of staff then shouted that they weren't going to get a doctor for me. I was clearly in a state of distress, hyperventilating, shaking and I was clutching my chest as I was having chest pains. They didn't get anyone for me the whole time I was having a panic attack. Despite having two staff permanently with me for supervision, not one person attempted to calm me down. I am amazed that being a mental health facility, not one member of staff tried to minimise my distress or talk to me.\r\nI was in a state of panic for a total of an hour before I began to calm down. A further hour later, I was seen by the psychiatrist still in distress and crying. I explained what the staff had done to me and the psychiatrist said they would investigate it. They knew about my history of sexual assault and understood the distress I was under. They apologised for what had happened. \r\nI was then released from the section 136. When I left the Unit, I cried frantically in the middle of the street. It was a member of the public who actually stopped to ask if I was ok, the first person (apart from the psychiatrist) to show some concern for my distress. This person called a taxi for me and stayed with me until it arrived. The fact that I had just come from a facility which is supposed to help people in mental distress, and that it was a member of the public who showed the care and concern that should have come from the nurses at the Unit, I believe brings shame and disgrace to South London and Maudsley NHS trust.", "I am really sorry that you have been distressed by an experience within our services.

At 70 she had a reasonably good life and we were grateful to the liver unit for all its support until April this year. \r\nMy mum was admitted with Ascitis and it appeared in Feb 10 that she really only had months. In April she was admitted to the liver ward with liver and kidney failure and severe Ascitis. We were informed the following day by her consultant that they would be suprised if she lasted a week. What happened from there was an absolute outcry. \r\nI am a social worker for the elderly and I have never met ward staff who were so unprofessional and seemed untrained, had no knowledge of patients in end stage liver faiulure, and such poor skills in managing symptoms or supporting the patient or family.\r\nMy mum had incontinence pads at my request as she was unable to weight bear and often disoriented.  But I was still having disagreements with her nurse who seemed more concerned about my mum becoming dependnet when she only had a few days anyway. \r\nIn my opinion, they failed to provide appropriate care, failed to manage her pain at the end stages, failed to recognise or provide palliative care when appropriate and subjected her to unecessary pain with intrusive procedures which could have been carried out under more appropriate and sensitive conditions which it was after the shambolic attempts at my mums expense. \r\nThat memory of the last two hours when she begged for pain relief to be told by ward Drs that there was no one available to see her and no contingency plans despite being reassured that when the time came she would recieve the drugs to help manage her pain as was her only request.\r\nShe died in agony while ward staff had their hand-over session chatting away while we waited outside that room for a response from the Dr to come to administer some morphine. They could not even give her paracetamol as there was no one available to unblock her intravenous line. The irony being that I had paracetamols in my handbag but she was unable to swallow.\r\nI will never forgive the staff on that ward for their lack of compassion, their ignorance and lack of insight of the very specialism they work in.

MIL was in a heightened state of confusion which could have been avoided had one of the Family been allowed by her side, YS and H were becoming increasingly anxious and upset as neither were allowed to be with my terminally ill MIL until after a lengthy time in the waiting area YS insisted. \r\nMIL was eventually admitted and settled onto the Medical Assessment Unit (MAU) in the early hours of Saturday morning.\r\nAt approximately 10.30 the next morning. H received a phone call from a member of staff to inform and prepare him for the shock he was to receive, my MIL had fallen out of bed and sustained a nasty injury to her neck, WHY ? Upon visiting, the Family were very distressed to see the result of the fall and were becoming increasing concerned over her welfare as it seemed to them that the ward was very short staffed. WHY?\r\nThat evening MIL was transferred to Ward 6 accompanied by H, eldest son (ES) and myself, we waited quite a while in the patients lounge whilst the staff settled her in. When we were allowed to her bedside, I was very disturbed to see the call bell still in place on the wall, out of reach, WHY? I immediately placed it on the bed within reach. The Family were very reluctant to leave and shared our concerns particularly of MIL's confusion with a nurse, who assured us they would keep a close eye on her.\r\nHaving witnessed serious failings in care afforded to my late Mother and a subsequent 3yrs to reach the end of local resolution complaint, I was, as may be expected, anxious to see this would not happen again. Whilst visiting on the third day I happened to read the Risk Assessment and was extremely concerned to read \u2018No signs of confusion' WHY? This surprised and shocked us as MIL suffered with short term memory loss and was in a constant state of confusion! I spoke to a member of staff regarding my findings and the following morning telephoned the Complaints department informing them of my concerns, arrangements were made for H and myself to meet with Elderly Care that same afternoon, our concerns were listened to, the meeting was productive, a laminate card with instructions was provided within hours and MIL was moved nearer to the nurses station as per our wishes, an investigation into the fall was also promised, as yet we have not received any feedback on this. WHY?\r\nUnfortunately, the Family felt very uneasy and reluctant to leave MIL, we perceived the ward to very short staffed. On numerous occasions drinking needs were not met, WHY? Often we found ourselves asking for a beaker and straws as they had not been made available, this is basic care and unacceptable that needs were not met and that the Family were faced with this problem on each visit. \r\nOne evening mearly a week after MIL entered hospital there was a marked deterioration in her condition, whilst we were yet again at the nurses station requesting drinking aids! WHY? H and myself were informed MIL was very poorly, had been diagnosed with Pneumonia the previous Monday, this was the first time any of the Family had been informed of the diagnosis WHY? Therefore it was a shock to read the POTTS at 20.00hrs that evening, the last entry of observations was 13.00hrs. Would 8hrs plus seems a lengthy interval for a patient in such a poorly condition? WHY? At the end of visiting, we tried to raise our concerns with the staff unfortunately they appeared to be in the depth of an emergency situation on one of the bays, we lingered for quite a while in the hope of speaking to someone, we felt very uneasy and anxious at having to wait 18 hours until the next visiting time. The emergency situation continued so we reluctantly made our way home with the family deciding to ring the ward first thing the following day to arrange a morning visit, sadly MIL passed away in the early hours without her family around her. WHY?\r\nThe next distressing event was for the Family to be told there was no one available to accompany us to the Viewing Room for 24hours despite being told on our first visit we would be welcome to visit with 30mins notice. \r\nWhy were the Family not offered the services of the multidisciplinary palliative care team?

Staff on PICU ward are extremely experienced in dealing with people who are acutely unwell and their families, and so I'm very sorry that you felt a member of staff was rude to you. If you can give me some specific details I will investigate your concerns formally with the staff concerned.\r\n\r\nWe know just how important family and friends can be during periods of ill-health and recovery, and we would always want to make sure they felt included in the care we provide as a Trust. Your visits will have been very important to your son and I am saddened that they were not reassuring to you. \r\n\r\nCreating an environment of respect and dignity for everyone we encounter is at the core of our values, and we would always want to maintain a high standard of care for every patient and their carers.  \r\n\r\nI understand that you feel that your son wasn't on the Becklin Centre ward for long enough for him to be fully treated.  Obviously I can not comment on his individual case without his permission, but the decision to temporarily transfer service users to PICU is always done following a full multi-disciplinary review and would only be done to support their ongoing care and safety. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately when some people are extremely unwell, they either need more intensive monitoring, or they can have impulses to harm or injure themselves or others. The PICU ward is better designed to deal with these types of situations than our general wards at the Becklin Centre. It is a locked ward and has been designed as a low stimulus environment; I do accept that this can make the ward seem less open and more sparse than our other wards.  \r\n\r\nThe aim of PICU is to increase safety and reduce stimulation. High levels of stimulation can make people feel more unwell and thus be at greater risk or require more medication \u2013 this is something that we try to avoid. As with any intensive care ward, we want people to be there for as short a spell as possible before being transferred back to an open ward such as in the Becklin Centre, where they are often more comfortable when feeling better. \r\n\r\nVery regrettably you say that your son sustained some injuries while he was on the ward. This is obviously a concern to me and I would like to know more so that I can thoroughly investigate it. Again, it would be helpful if you could contact PALS to help with this.\r\n\r\nAs a mother it must be very distressing to see your son so unwell and unable to communicate with you at such a time. From the information you give it is difficult to explain why this was the case. Both sedation and slurring of speech can be a temporary side effect of the medication used to treat such acute mental health problems and reduce distress. \r\n\r\nIt can be unpleasant both for service users and families but such medication is safe and is given by health professionals so that service users feel more comfortable and make a quicker recovery. I can assure you that such side effects are only temporary.\r\n\r\nI can't help but be worried about how upset this experience has made you, and so as well as talking to me about your concerns about your son's care, I wonder if you would  be open to getting some support from our Carers Team?  \r\n\r\nThey can offer you information and support both while your son is in hospital, and once he's discharged. They can be contacted on 0113 2954445, or if you speak to the PALS Team they can arrange for the Carers Team to give you a ring. \r\n\r\nIt's not clear from your posting where your son is currently, but I'm really hoping that you've already seen some improvement in his condition since posting this.  And even though you've raised concerns that I'd still like to learn more about, I do want to thank you for taking the time to tell us about your experiences here on Patient Opinion.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nJanice Morris\r\nClinical Services Manager\r\nAdult Directorate", "In May of last year I had surgery to cure me of Epilepsy. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately during the operation, there was an accident which lead to a bleed giving me a stroke. I was in the high dependence on Ward N1, and I was ventilated and in a bad state. I was not absorbing the drugs they were giving me.\r\n\r\nI remember seeing my consultant at the window and I remember sticking up my thumb to him.\r\n\r\nI was then taken off the ventilator and I had a grommet inserted.  I vaguely remember moving slowly through the bays towards the Ward main doors, so I knew I was slowly getting better. \r\n\r\nI was then moved onto Ward N2 in the bottom bay and the process of moving down the bays towards the ward main doors. I remember one day when a nurse was sat near me and drinking a coffee I said to her \u201cI'd kill for one of those\u201d so she called for a doctor to take the grommet from my throat. The same nurse brought me a coffee later \u2013 and it was heaven.\r\n\r\nThe stroke had left me in a wheelchair and barely able to walk. But I slowly moved through the bays. But I felt that I needed to be somewhere I could recover and work on my walking and speech.  \r\n\r\nThe staff were brilliant and understood my needs and they were amazing, they managed to find a place where I could do this. Nurse Pierce, the surgery nurse was amazing, and showed constant support. The one conversation I had with her was when I was being wheeled off the ward to go get the taxi to go to the respite unit, was she asked if I'll be ok, and my answer with absolute determination \u201cI won't let this me beat me\u201d\r\n\r\nI was in N1 and N2 for about 3 weeks.\r\n\r\nDuring my time in the respite centre my ability to walk returned and my speech also started to return, although I needed the occasional support of a speech therapist.\r\n\r\nI remember the follow appointment I had with my consultant, Nurse Peirce was also there. And I marched into the appointment with my head held high, and be able to do that felt so amazing. I think both were surprised. They told me \u201cthey were not sure what to expect\u201d. My consultant explained to me what had happened during the operation, and there was a sincere regret in his voice. As I left the office I remember turning to Nurse Peirce and saying \u201cI told you I wouldn't let it beat me\u201d and she smiled and said \u201cyou certainly did\u201d\r\n\r\nThe surgery hasn't completely stopped the seizures, they are way less regular than they were before the operation. Even for this I am grateful as they now longer have such a big impact on my life. \r\n\r\nFor this I would offer my most sincere thank you to my consultant, for the life changing surgery, and to all the staff on Wards  N1 and N2 who cared for me, the nurse got me that Coffee, and the nurse who took me to the respite centre, not that I wish to belittle the work of all the other staff, far from it.\r\n", "I am sorry to hear of your experience with the Ambulance Service and we would welcome the opportunity to discuss your concerns.Please consider contacting me, Marie Tideswell, Regional Head of Patient Experience on telephone number 01384 246366 or by [email](mailto:complaints@wmas.nhs.uk) .", "Firstly, please accept my sincere condolences for the sad loss of your husband.

We have contacted the hospital directly on your behalf and asked for a prompt response to the issues you have raised.

Can we please thank you once again for bringing this to our attention", " I believe that because his surgery was delayed dads bowel died, perforated, he was full of pus and had peritonitis. While waiting for his operation he and I were constantly told he was going in a 'few minutes' 'extra half hour' but it was over 13hrs after he was declared as needing emergency surgery that he actually went.. A few days after surgery while his bowel wasn't working he was on a liquid diet, but on one occasion he was given solid food. So he vomited, took it into his lungs and developed aspiration pneumonia and was very ill.\n\nThe day before he was discharged his wound completely broke open, and it was noted in his chart he might need a drain placed. The next day-no drain- no nothing- he was sent home with this open 5 inch by 2 inch full thickens wound in his groin. The referral to the district nurse for wound care didn't appear to go through and no one came to do his dressing. \n\nHe was doubly incontinent with diarrhoea so the dressing was soaked with urine and faeces. He lost over a stone in two weeks because he couldn't eat the food- I had asked for soft food or a dietary consult but it didn't happen. No one said a word about his discharge problems, the wound, incontinence, that he couldn't feed himself or walk unaided-and he couldn't be left alone. \n\nHe was sent home with 5 incontinent pads and 2 bed 'pads' my son had to go to the 24 hr Asda at midnight ( he came home at 6pm) to buy incontinent pads, pyjamas, towels and bed sheets.- everything we had was soiled . The dirty pads had to sit in the back garden as they can't go out to the dustman. I had to arrange council 'yellow bag' pick up, get the DNA out -who tried to get him sent back to hospital and arrange for my own carers. \n\n5 days later he developed urinary retention -that's why he was incontinent he was blocked and dribbling-and went back into hospital. The district nurse insisted that tissue viability see his wound and maybe place this drain. Tissue viability did and agreed. But as it meant him staying a few days, someone from the original surgical team came up and clipped the wound closed in his bed in the ward during visiting time. He was sent home an hour later. When the clips from this still dirty draining wound were remove it reopened immediately and took a further 9 weeks to completely close. \n\nMy dad was 86, very deaf (and his hearing aid was usually connected up incorrectly by the nursing staff so it blocked his ear completely) and had vascular dementia so had poor memory. I had been his carer for 5 years and I'm a retired nurse. Yet no one ever told me anything about his condition. When I complained I was told by the matron conducting a meeting between me and the staff involved in his care that if I was nurse I should have realised he wasn't fit to go home. Somehow my fathers GP and the Dns thought I had taken him home against medical advice- but he was discharged by the hospital and i was told to collect him. \n\nWhen I went to collect him at the time I was told to, he was soaked with urine; his head and hair, Pj's, sheets blankets and pillow. He was wearing a pad that fell to the floor and splattered urine. \n\nI felt like my complaint ended up not about dad, but what I supposedly did or didn't do. He had 3 admissions -the complaint was about the 1st, wound care second- yet somehow the hospital confused them all and the consultant at the 3rd became involved. This took place towards the end of 2009 and the complaint still is. I've never seen the surgeon who was caring for him at the time I made the complaint about.\nThe whole thing was nightmare- and dad died a bit later from complications of the delay.\n", "Posted on behalf of East & North Hertfordshire NHS Trust:\r\n\r\nClearly the comments posted are very concerning and based on the information provided, we have been able to make contact with the person who placed them.  We did this to make sure we understood more about what happened to their father (this case dates back to 2009), but also how their concerns were handled by the Trust at the time. \r\n\r\nAs with all complaints, we investigated the issues raised in great detail \u2013 including those around treatment delays, discharge arrangements, wound care and continence issues.  All our findings were shared at a meeting between the family and clinical team looking after the patient, the outcome of which was also shared in writing subsequently.  This allowed us to acknowledge that there had been some delays in our initial investigation, for which we apologised at the time \u2013 and have done so since.\r\n \r\nGood patient care is always at the heart of everything we do, which is why we were saddened to discover that the family of this patient is still clearly unhappy \u2013 even after all this time has passed.  We did carry out a thorough investigation two years ago, but unfortunately the family did not consider that our response addressed their concerns sufficiently.  Our offers of further meetings with the Trust's senior doctors and nurses were declined by the family, who instead approached the Ombudsman.   Towards the end of 2010, the Trust was contacted by the Ombudsman stating that its team could find no cause to investigate the family's complaint further and had closed the file. \r\n ", "I am very sorry that you have had such a negative experience of our services.

At the age of twelve I spent the night in hospital due to the severe effect of this bullying. The first operation took place in December 2009 and I was to believe that things had gone well. My confidence began to grow and as a student nurse at university I began to excel at presentations and assignments. I no longer lacked confidence in standing in front of my colleagues. \nIn July 2010 I attended a joint appointment at this hospital where the surgeon and orthodontist explained that I could have further surgery to improve the occlusion (I still had an overbite), I agreed even though my family and friends begged me not to. I had the operation in September 2010 and as an inpatient was sent to a clinic to have an assessment post surgery. It was advised I have an x-ray, so I was wheeled off for one and was then transferred back to the orthodontic clinic which was very busy. I was left alone in the dental chair in a room with the door closed for around half an hour and fell asleep. At one point the consultant orthodontist opened the door to offer to partially recline the dental chair but I refused due to the fact that i still felt very sick and sore. (I have spent most of the afternoon and evening vomiting stale blood and had not had much sleep). \nThe surgeon and sidekick came in around half an hour later to explain surgery had gone wrong and showed me a profile picture of my face saying that I had an open bite now and that I could have surgery one week later to correct it. I was wheeled up with a SHO to sign the consent form and to prepare the drug chart for the next week. \nLater in the evening I was discharged home and told that I would receive a letter in the week to confirm the operation. I received nothing so left a message with the departments booking coordinator and a friend took me there the afternoon before surgery was due to take place again. \nWe asked a clerk to ask the surgeon if the operation was still going ahead, what would be done etc. The clerk went off to speak to the surgeon and came back saying the operation was still going ahead and that I should show up at 7.30 the next morning. We asked her to find out if it was okay for me to still take pain relief as I was still in a great deal of discomfort. Again she went off to speak to him and came back saying that this was fine and that the surgeon had said that they were looking forward to seeing me the next day. We left a little bit miffed off. \nDuring the night I emailed PALS with frustration at the lack of information I had been given and explained that I was confused as to what would be happening to me.\nI showed up for surgery again the next morning. The surgeon came and gave a very brief hello and made a joke about deja vu. The anaesthethic came and picked up on my anxiety, I wanted to cry when they asked why I was having the surgery. I just told them that as far as I knew it had been unsuccessful. When I was put to sleep they gave me some magic meds and the last thing I remember saying is \"I feel so happy\". \nI came round in recovery to the worst pain I have experienced in my life. I used foul language and asked the nurse for more pain relief. I sat up in the bed holding my head. She explained that I had already had a disclosed amount of morphine and asked had I taken pain relief before admission. Yes I had. \nIt took some time for me to settle but I could hear the surgeon next to her in the recovery room discussing the fact that Tony Curtis had died and some other things that were in the paper that day. She came to hold my hand and said I was being transferred back to the ward now. \nWhen I was transferred and they had done my obs, I grabbed my phone out of my bag which someone had left on the chair and phoned PALS to see if they had received my email. The person I spoke to kept asking me to repeat myself (not surprising considering the surgery I had just undergone). They confirmed they had not received it. I don't remember much else about the phone call, just that I definitely made it. \nThe morning after this surgery I was wheeled to an appointment with the surgeon and consultant orthodontist and was examined again after having another xray. The surgeon asked the orthodontist \"What can we do to prevent this from happening again\"? while I was in the dental chair and the orthodontist did not answer before saying goodbye to me. \nI left after being discharged and told my family and friends all that had happened. I also told my university as I was shocked about it all. \nI have since put in a complaint to this hospital. I have been very depressed since the incident and have been so upset that when I contacted this consultant orthodontist by email to say I was not happy to return for further treatment (other things happened after the surgery involving having seven mini screws placed in total which I have since discovered from NICE that I should have been given written information in regards to consent and understanding what these were doing. interventional procedures which did not follow nice guidelines around consent. As soon as I went private these were removed immediately by the new team.) I wrote to PALS which my GP advised to be transferred to another Trust as I could not return. This never materialised and I ended up having to borrow money to pay privately for my treatment elsewhere.\nAs it now stands the hospital are aware of what has happened. I received a letter from the chief executive stating that the surgeon states that if i had contacted the surgeon's secretary before my third surgery they would have been very happy to discuss the procedure with me (we attended the surgeon's department and they relayed information via their ward clerk to us, but did not come out or ask us to return). \nThe hospital now states that this surgeon gave me a clinical diagnosis of \"Lax Ligament Syndrome\". They surgeon never once mentioned this. They did ask me to bend my thumb back in July 2010 and asked me whether I could dance. I explained that I did dance sometimes (I should have explained only when I get very drunk). They now claim that as they do not have a policy on consent to operations and signing consent within 24 hours they do not use one. Yet the department of health and general dental council have one as do other trusts. Their protocol is for patients not to drink/drive, make important decisions/ sign legal documents within 24 hours of a general anaesthetic. My colleagues have advised me many times of this and it is on the original letter for my second surgery. \nI am at my wits end with this Trust. We are all taught to give patients the right to make and to be involved in decisions about their healthcare. I was not allowed this right. I feel the Trust's response is laughable and contains lies. Is this really \"High Quality Care for All\"?\n\n", "I don't really know what happened to my daughter, she was admitted to Good Hope hospital at the end of December with suspected appendicitis/cyst on ovary. She had an operation without scanning her and removed a tumour. Very rare, so rare that it took until six days before she died for them to disclose that she had Sarcoma.\n\nMy daughter was then transferred to The Queen Elizabeth Hospital from Good Hope Hospital on an evening. She was admitted and then transferred on the following day (Monday) to the young persons unit. \nShe met her oncologist that evening. They discussed chemotherapy with her and decided to start it on the Wednesday. The Oncologist told us that best case scenario was 3 years if it worked, 12 weeks if it didn't. \n\nOur daughter started chemo at in the evening of the Wednesday. On Thursday morning when I entered her room her drip was off. I asked a nurse who told me it had a battery and she was busy with a patient. \nI waited another hour and approached the senior nurse who looked panicked and ran straight into my daughter's room. They said that she hadn't been re-attached since she had been taken to the toilet during the night. She apologised and said that this would not happen again.\nOn the Friday, the Oncologist came and said it was pointless to continue treatment and that my daughter had days left. She died 6 hours later in a most distressing manner. \n\nI have been advised to ask for the clinical pathways of my daughter's case from her first admission to Good Hope until her death in Queen Elizabeth. \n\nI believe the treatment my daughter received in Good Hope Hospital was appalling. However when I approached them they have adhered to Government requirements on times to deal with complaints. I don't really want to discuss the appalling care she received in Good Hope as they are investigating my complaint. \n\nQueen Elizabeth however have not even had the decency to offer condolences and have not given any time frames. Their response has been that nurses and doctors are very busy treating patients and when they have time they will get back to me. In my opinion, not checking for mistakes that may have taken place and continuing on the same path is arrogant and unbelievable. \n\nI do not want a response that requires me to contact a machine linking me to PALS which is the standard and I think inappropriate response on the swift death of my young daughter. \n\nI feel it is so understandable the people in our position choose litigation.\n", "Hello again,\r\n\r\nWe would like to help but because of the way Patient Opinion is set up we don't know who you are and so we can't respond to any of the specific detailed comments that you have made.

", "My father was admitted to the Queen's medical centre hospital at the beginning of April  after a fall. He was later transferred from A & E to the admission ward. It was a nightmare situation from start to finish for him and his family.\nWhen we came to visit him the next day. The following was noted.\n* The staff seemed unaware that he is registered partially sighted; very hard of hearing and that English is not his first language.\n* He had not been given any dinner, not one nurse we spoke to could explain the reason for this. We can only assume that when (if) they had asked what he wanted, he had not heard or not understood them and they took it to mean that he did not want any.\n* It seemed that his sight and hearing problem were not taken into account. When medication was given to him, the nurse did not stay around to make sure that he understood that one was in tablet form and the other in liquid form. He could not see the tablets and did not realise there were three of them therefore dropped two on the floor. If I had not been there, would the nurse have even noticed being as she simply had gone on to the next patient? He thought the liquid medication was in tablet form and spilt it over himself. \n* I asked for an interrupter to be provided for him, the nurse said she would inquire but an interrupter never materialised. Despite lots of leaflets always advising that interrupters could be provided, not at any stage were we offered one not even when we asked.\n* My father needed to use a urine bottle, but it took the nurse so long to bring it that he wet himself. His hospital gown was changed but then left on the food tray along with the urine bottle, which he went on to use. Not one nurse bothered to remove the soiled hospital gown or urine bottle, they were simply left on his food tray. I would have removed it but was not sure what to do with it, pour it in the sink? Put the dirty gown in the bin? Or was there a special bin for these things? So I asked a passing nurse to remove it, she said she would come back for it, but she did not. \n* The supper plates arrived and still the urine bottle and soiled gown remained on the tray. A nurse removed the urine bottle just before putting the plate down. Therefore with one hand she was handling a urine bottle and with the other food. But she left the soiled gown on the food tray.\n* Under the hospital bed, my brother found a syringe, an empty crisp packet, and a piece of green material.\n* On the corridors near the wards there was a dirty surgical glove laying on the floor, a bit further along another glove was just lying there. And piled up just outside the entrance doors to the ward a stack of mattresses were leaning against the wall. Various boxes and other bits and pieces were also on the corridors. \n* In the evening he was due to be transferred to another ward. He was told to get in a wheelchair. The nurse made no attempt to help him out the bed or into the chair. An 87-year-old man, unstable on his feet, who had sustained a head injury, who cannot hear well or understand, was just left to get on with it. Once in the chair, there came the decision that he was not to be sent on the other ward just yet, and he was left in the wheelchair by the bed. Some time later he was told to get back into the bed again. No assistance was offered from the medical staff. We, his family, had to get him out the chair and into the bed. Later he was asked again to get in the wheel chair but the nurse had not even put the brakes on it and he almost landed on the floor. We had not been there I feel he may have sustained a more serious injury than the one he came in with! \n* In the space of half an hour, his medical notes were lost a total of three times. \n* There seemed to be a lot of nurses on the ward, all seemed busy and stressed but did not seem to be doing much.\n* He was then moved to ward 49. We requested that they wrote above his bed, next to his name, that he was partially sighted to make staff award of his situation. Our request made several times went unheeded. My father was so unhappy with the way he had been treated, that he was ready to walk out the door and find his own way home. The whole experience had left him very distressed.\n* My father suffers from Glacoma, and has to use eye drops daily, and I was seriously concerned that the staff showed so little awareness of the importance of him taking these drops. They were locked away, but because his English is so poor, he found it very difficult to explain to the nurses that he needed his drops. \n* On being discharged, no one asked if he had anyone at home to care for him, there was no referral to social services to check up on him. He could have been going home to a cold house with no one to care for him. No inquires were made about his welfare at home. They did not even tell us when he was to go to have his stitches out. \n* I made notes of all I saw there and completed a comments card. To this day I have had no feed-back from the hospital management about my comments. \n* Our experience of Queen's Medical centre was a nightmare from start to finish.\nWe experienced poor standards of hygiene and a big lack of communication between various staff members during my father's time at QMC\n", "Dear 'note938', \r\nThis is a message from the Lead Nurse for Adult Inpatient Services:\r\n\r\nWe are very sorry that you have had this experience.

I feel that unless one is severally mentally ill, the community and local mental health team do not take those with much milder illness seriously.\n\nIt's my experience that no one from the mental health team or recovery services are willing to be flexible around one's needs. Certain staff may be ok but I feel that a majority of the people I've encountered just stick to the book.\n\nI got a community support worker trying to do exposure therapy - always thought that kind of therapy must be done by a trained therapist, not a community support worker.\n\nI feel like there is no willingness to understand the patients needs and take physical, social, as well as mental health problems into consideration when doing assessments.\n\nIn general, I think I am receiving very very poor support and lack of understanding from most members of team that I deal with. I've seen several specialists, who I have felt do not know what to do and have shown little compassion.\n\nIn my opinion my local mental health team does not like people making complaints about their services - I felt like they tried to blame me, even to the point of making me out to be the problem. Only because I am mentally ill, doesn't mean I do not understand or am stupid, but the mental health services have made me feel stupid.\n\nI feel there is a lack of support and understanding for those with less serious mental health problems.\n\nIn my experience the staff involved with my care have shown no creativity or flexibility.\n\nI feel there has been a lack of communication from the staff I've dealt with.\n\nI feel that staff have made most of the decisions for me, I felt my input was not put forward.", "This describes the horrific experience I had during the delivery of my still born son. \nThe midwife had only been qualified for six months, despite me being determined as high risk. The midwife & doctor argued whilst I was in delivery.  I contracted an infection whilst in labour - and no antibiotics were offered. \nI was not told my son had died during delivery, as they failed to monitor his heart beat effectively. \nMy baby was delivered horrifically by Forceps & was given to me, even though he had passed away. I believe this wasted valauble time to resucitate him. \nI was left bleeding for 20 mins, while they waited for a theater - I lost 2 litres of blood. \nOverloading my system with fluid while I had stitches in theatre, rendered me in the HDU Dept with a Pulmonary Odema (HDU - are a fabulous team by the way - and put the disgraceful care I had in the maternity department to shame!). \nI was discharged from the maternity unit, and left to self catheterise for 2 months, as they did not realise my bladder was distended, and did not realise I had a womb infection & a UTI. \nI was offered no bereavement counselling regarding the death of my baby, and had to be admitted to Queens Hospital in Romford to get the treatment I needed.\n\nMy experience of the maternity department was absolutely horrific & I wouldn't wish what I have been through on anyone else!", "My sister aged 50 went into the Royal Gwent Hospital about 4 weeks ago as a varicose vein in her stomach was bleeding due to her having liver damage from a while ago.\nShe had the op to sort it and the op was a sucess. She started to recover then became ill and family was told she had contracted C. diff.\nNow after her op, before she got c diff, the ward she was put on had notices up saying that there was an infection on that ward - so why did they put her on that ward after her op?\nAlso the ward was not clean, toilets were terrible.\nLast week my sister was moved into HDU and went downhill very quickly until the doctor said there was nothing more they could do for her. She died two days ago.\nI think someone should be held accountable.", "I had an appointment to reassess my temporal lobe epilepsy at UHNS and a new dosage was agreed.\nMy GP read the instructions incorrectly and effectively doubled my dose.

I made a few complaints that were followed up by management staff reassuring me that they had been looked at and measures taken to resolve them, but I must say I did not see any significant improvements in patient care, but I did feel that there were some change of attitudes from some members of staff towards myself and my family member, not for the good I must say! \nMy family member was a victim of aggression from another patient and had some personal belongings stolen, you would think that this could never happen in an \u201cintensive\u201d care unit but it did. \nI have been for some time considering legal action and following recent findings regarding issues on other NHS units regarding patient care I think this is the only way forward. \nTalk about NHS reform, yes I couldn't agree more but let's do it properly starting with patients care and making people responsible for their actions and not, as I feel is the case, protected by the NHS umbrella.", "Dear 'thephantom', \r\nWe are sorry you had such a distressing experience and we are committed to learning from what you have to say about the services on Charnock Ward.\r\nThe nurses and managers from the facility would very much like to meet with you and your family so that they can hear more about your experience.

I was 'observed' twice in the entire time I was there, and I discharged myself. \nI was told to do a 24 hour urine collection. I handed it in and went back for my results. I was informed that they had lost a giant bottle of urine between that ward and the lab which as far as I am aware is just downstairs, so they made me do another one. I went back for the results, still no results.. and when I went back again, they had miraculously found the 1st collection! \nThey confirmed to me that I had pre-eclampsia and that they wanted to start inducing me (at the start of september). Late on the night my induction was booked, I was taken to the delivery suite to have my first induction. The delivery suite were fantastic, I couldn't fault it. \nMy partner was kicked out when I was sent back to the triage ward despite the fact my contractions had started. I was pacing the halls in agony all night, not offered any pain relief because as far as I was aware there was no midwife on the ward what so ever. I saw women giving birth on the triage ward assisted by other patients because the midwives were not available.  \nOne midwife who did eventually turn up shouted at another patient when she told her she needed to push - she said it wasn't that bad, told her to stop crying and that she didn't need to push. The midwife took her gas and air away from her, gave it to another patient and then she left, regardless of the fact the poor woman was pushing her buzzer! \n20 minutes later the lady's baby was born, she was assisted by two other patients and as far as I know she received no pain relief. \nI eventually had my son via c section in mid September, after alot of begging and pleading with my consultant. He told me he would approve the section because I had been 'very patient'.  I had no choice really, I was contracting, but not dilating, and not once was I offered pain relief. \nI found the post natal ward awful. I was expected to know everything about parenting, and when I asked a question I felt like they treated me like I was a burden because they had to show me what to do or answer my question. \nI will definitely not be going back to Lister to have my 2nd. It took me 6 months to get over that experience.   ", "I voluntarily admitted myself to the unit after several suicide attempts,(after a devastating life event and other things) I was told not to worry, and that as I wasn't on a section, things would be ok.\nIt was very hard being away from my family and I hated being 'locked up'.\nAfter a couple of days, things became so much clearer and I wanted to go home to my family.\nI was told that if I attempted to leave I would be placed on a section and might be detained for weeks!\nI had followed their rules, totally co-operated with everything and yet they refused to let me go, it took a week for them to eventually allow me to go home.\nI then recieved a phone call saying they wanted me back in! I wasn't told it was only a visit home for 2 days, and I was told my child would not be returned to me until I was deemed ok by the staff there (who didn't know me at all)!\nThis totally tipped me over the edge and I drunk a bottle of wine and ended up in Derby A&E (as I suffer from stomach pain after alcohol, but I wanted to numb the emotional pain). \nThey saw this as a suicide attempt (which I stress it wasn't), and then rushed me back to the Radbourne unit where they tried to force me to take antipsychotic medication which I didnt want or need. Several members of staff, dragged me into a cell (or isolation room as they call it), held me down on the floor and injected me twice with sedatives into my bottom, and left me alone all night locked in this cell, on a mattress on the floor!\nI feel I didn't deserve that at all, I was non violent just intensely upset.\nI was kept in for another week and had to sign my child over to their father (who had been absent from their life for months) until they deemed I was able to cope again.\nI would be weary of being 'presuaded' to voluntarily admit myself, as I am now aware that in my case it was not as cut and dry as they made out and I feel now that my future and freedom is in their hands. \nIf I didn't take exactly what meds they told me to take, didn't eat when they told me to, and actually had an opinion, I got threatened with a section, and faced being detained for months away from my family.\n Even though this happened months ago to me, and I am now ok, they contacted social services and child protection services who won't leave me alone, despite the fact I live in a lovely house with my child, am in a secure relationship and it's been proven my child is very stable and happy.\nI feel that once they have flagged you with 'mental health' issues after an admission, you are on the system for ages and can't escape.\n I know as I am pregnant and suddenly had an inspection from social services to ensure I'm mentally capable to look after my child when they arrive.

The pt was resisting and the nurse said \"Come on ,come on, she's clenching her teeth.\"  The pt did not want the medication because it made her sick  and the pt had been vomitting all afternoon, the vomit bowls were there containing bile stained vomit. The pts daughter tried to intervene to no avail.  The pt was forced to swallow the contents of three syringes which exeeded the prescribed dose knowing it would make the pt even more ill.  \n\nImmediately prior to this event the staff nurse had asked the daughter about the pts gall bladder, recognising the stained vomit and appearing to understand  that the pt was having gall bladder \"attacks\" due to obstruction.  \nThese attacks cause severe pain and nausea.  \n\nThe pt died two weeks later having become skeletal in appearance, being unable to eat or drink and continually forced to take diet and medicaton which did not suit her and caused vomiting and also threatened if she did not comply.  The extent of the vomitting was never acurately reported in the notes and the consultant said it was insignificant.  The dietician who prescribed the medication and diet had been told twice about the gall bladder problem by the pt and daughter but the dietician denied all knowledge of this and said she was never made aware of the vomitting. \n\nThe daughters concerns made to all staff and the dietician and the consultant were never heeded or recorded in the notes .  The pt died  in agonising pain two weeks later from \"old age\" and the daughter could get no more information about the exact cause of death.  There had been more incidents in the 3 week admission and the daughter, having worked in health and social care for 30 years as a registered practitioner made complaints to the hospital, Nusring and Midwifery Council and Health Professions Council.  She wondered if the pt had suffered a ruptured gall bladder as a result of the fatty diet and she found out that the pt had tricuspid insufficieny affecting liver function and causing circulatory collapse in her legs.  The pt was refused oxygen when gasping for breath and there is much more.  \n\nThe daughter contacted the coroner a few weeks later after reading the notes and gradually piecing together all the events surrounding the death of the patient.

I was very ill with ulcerative colitis at the time and severely anaemic. My tooth started hurting when eating and for  a while after eating before Christmas that year and despite being very ill I struggled in to get something done. He looked at it and said it looked fine but he could put a gold crown on because I was sick I didn't have amalgam. I asked if he could do a white filling or a temporary filling because there was too much tooth left to put a crown on and I couldn't stay long due to my health. He refused both and I just asked him if it was safe to leave it not knowing what else to do. He said it would be ok. I went home and it started hurting severely during the Christmas holidays for several days I was in pain.. There were no emergency dentists for the whole time   until it stopped hurting and even then when the nerve was obviously dead I couldn't have got to the nearest one and queued for treatment which was already to late.\nThat's only the start of the story. The tooth hurt on biting for a while and I went to the dentist again when the filling finally fell out because it was loose. Then a temporary filling was put in. Eventually later that year a partial gold crown was put on even though I told the dentist the tooth was dead. He just looked at the Xrays and did nothing else to determine if it was dead. He said they were inconclusive.\nAfter the crown was on the remainder of the tooth soon broke off and I had to go back again. He then repaired the broken part with composite stuck onto the gold.\nI asked if would stick and he didn't seem too sure. Not long after the repair broke off taking more of the tooth with it. When I went back again he admitted he had been unprofessional repairing it that way and said it was a disaster but he decided to level the tooth to teh gum and put a complete crown on. This seemed to work but the tooth was still dead with no root canal and hurt on biting sometimes. He did the crown with no anaesthetic and there was no pain. Nevertheless he still refused to accept the nerve was dead.  I entirely lost confidence in this dentist. He has been rude to me and threatened to take teeth out when I complained of pain. The same thing happened with a lower molar before this and eventually he had to admit it was dead when pus came through the gum. He may have been able to save that one too if he had replaced the filling in time. He prevents me seeing the other dentist in his practice.  When the tooth started giving me a lot more pain this year I finally had to go a private dentist and she found pus coming from around the tooth and determined it was infected. and would need a root canal. I have decided to get this done at the cost of \u00a3300 to \u00a3450 because I no longer trust the NHS dentist and I believe he caused me to need this root canal.  \nI may now need to also pay for another crown which will cost another 400 to 500 and I normally get free treatment. There are no other NHS dentists in my area either. He also made no allowance for my state of health and I felt he treated me disrespectfully. \nRecently he also left a temporary filling in a back tooth for two and a half years, which was quite deep. There was little left and the dentine was exposed close to the  pulp. The private dentist said this was unacceptable and filled it. He was eventually going to put a gold crown on which the private dentist also said was unnecessary. He also has left a wisdom tooth with a hole in it for the several years where a filling fell out\n\n Sorry about the long story.\n", "My grandfather was admitted to urology for re-catherization and ended up being in there for 6 weeks. Doctors had told us he would be back at home making boxes for the garden which he was doing a couple of weeks before admission. \n\nPrior to admission my grandfather was mobilizing himself. He would walk to the garden, round the block, even to the toilet but would need assistance of carers for other things only 2 days this was implemented before. Before admission my grandfather had no pressure sores, clean teeth, shaven, immaculately clean and tidy, could feed himself and would drink huge amounts of fluids. My grandfather was then moved to another ward where the care he received was even worse - he had bruising which appeared all over his arms and had a couple of skin tears. We had asked but not been given cot bumpers to protect him whilst in bed as he would always lean to one side due to his tumour.\n\nNurses had told me on more occasions than I can remember that they were turning my grandfather for pressure relief but every time I had visited and that was very often he was always on his back his dressing had been left on that long they were all weepy. I asked whilst in there to change his dressing I even offered myself to change it but I was never allowed to. \n\nThey had left meals for him to eat which half of the time he had spilt. Medication more often than not was left on a pot on the table in his bed or on the floor which he could not put the tablets in his mouth or lift a cup. When I left I'd always give him the call bell every time I went in he'd never have it. One time it was left at the top of his pillow tucked in. How was he going to reach it? My grandfather said to me once if only I could tell you. \n\nIt seemed to me that he was not being given fluids, they said he was refusing it. Every time family would go in he would drink like a fish so then would go on a drip for re-hydration. He also contracted c difficile and mrsa whilst in there care which the test I had requested myself. \n\nBy the end of his stay my grandfather was incontinent. On discharge from hospital my family were told that he was clear from infection meaning no more cdifficile when 2 days after being home we requested his own gp do a stool sample. \n\nAfter my grandfather's death, we received the test results in which he tested positive for cdifficile. My grandfather was a terminal cancer patient with no pain management he was given paracetamol for god sake. 4 days after discharge my grandfather lost his life. I think this is down to the impact of treatment he received in this hospital's care. I sincerely hope this never happens to anyone else.\n", "I was under this hospital from early 2003 for water infections and blood in my water which I was in pain for, I had several tests done but the symptons continued over a 5 year period and all I was put on was antibiotics which doesn't help.\nOver this time up to 2008 I had made several attempts to get my problem sorted through appointments with urology department - even made a few attempts through a&e but told by triage that I only had stomach ache and to go home and take paracetomal. This was all the care I received until june 2008 when my husband who is a disabled person called an ambulance. When they turned up I had the same treatment as before, that he should have called for a doctor as I only had a stomach ache which wasn't bad enough for an ambulance. my husband was very upset and told them that they either take me in to hospital or he would take me in himself as I was in so much pain that I couldn't walk properly. They did then take me but they made me walk in acute pain bent over to the ambulance which was over 200 yards away from my home. \n\nWhen I finally got to Frimley Park Hospital the doctor that saw me told my husband and I that I was suffering from acute kidney failure and if left a few more days I would not be here talking to you, i would have been dead.\n\nI was in hospital for over 5 days in this time I only saw a doctor a couple of times and in this time was told that they had put a stent in to my kidney so that it could work the best way it could as I was only born with 1 kidney and this is the reason for all my water infections. Apparently my kidney wasn't working to its fullest.\n\nSo why did this hospital leave me for 5 years in pain from water infections and blood in my water?\n\nReleased from hospital in June 2008, told everything was fine but I had to go back after a few weeks for a check up and results on outstanding scans.\n\nMy husband and I went back sat in and sat in out patient department for over a hour and half over my appointment time. I listened to another person complaining that they were going to be late for further appointments so the staff decided to put this person in before me to keep him quiet, not bad considering I was already one and half hours over my appointment.\n\nWhen it finally came to my appointment a man came out and called my name and I asked my husband who he was because I had never met him before and my husband said he had never seen him before either. I walked in through the door and before I had a chance to sit down he said he was sorry to hear that I had Bladder Cancer, which you could imagine took me by complete shock as no one had mentioned that I had suspected cancer when I was in hospital a few weeks before. I remember sitting down and listening to this urology surgeon talking to me but don't remember everything that was told to me other than they were releasing me from the Hospital as they were sending me to St Peter's Hospital in Chertsey for them to sort my Bladder Cancer out.\n\nAt no point did I have my husband with me when they broke the news I had cancer - there wasn't even a nurse in the room with him either. I left the room in a daze and in shock I walked past my husband and when I got out of the front entrance of the hospital broke down in tear. I told him what I had been told and he was at that point very angry because no one at any point had told him that I had cancer. He wanted to go back and find out what their game was and wanted to know how the hell I got Bladder Cancer after being under Frimley Park Hospital for over 5 years for treatment of water infections and blood in water and nothing sorted until I was rushed into hospital with acute kidney failure. Since having bladder cancer I have found out from cancer research that continuous water infections and blood in water is a symptom of Bladder Cancer so I am disgusted with Frimley Park Hospital as I was seeking help from this hospital for this condition with out any help. \n\nSince I found out I had Bladder Cancer I have had my bladder removed straight away because the cancer was so far advanced the other hospital could not save my bladder. I have had to live with incontinance problems since and had to live with a stoma and a disposable bag which has to be changed every time I go to the toilet. I feel this is all because Frimley Park Urology department couldn't work out why I was having continous water infections over a 5 year term.\n\nI did make a complaint to this hospital but this hospital didn't take any blame in me getting bladder cancer. Apparently a letter from a senior manager at the trust which stated that I should have known I had cancer and that it was my doctors responsibility also - but I feel that it isn't mine or my doctors fault that this was not diagnosed because my doctor did everyting thing they should have, and I continually sought help. The hospital advised them to do because after all I was under Frimley Park Hospital for treatment which I certain did not get and still don't.\n\nThis hospital seems to have a very good reputation with the public but in my case, the hospital failed to diagnose me with a very serious illness and I have not received an apology. \n\nI am still under St Peters Hospital Chertsey and this hospital seems to often get the rough end of the stick with the press but in my opinion it is a great hospital and in my experience, there is always some one there that will talk to my about any worries - something I've not experienced at Frimley Park Hospital.\n\nI do give any one a bit of information though and that is if you have any of the early symptoms that I had, which ever hospital you are under, push hard to get answers but if you are not happy with what a hospital is saying I would say get a second opinion because I wish I had - I might have been saved all this in the first place.\n\n ", "I have just returned home from collecting my fiance from the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales.\n\nShe suffers from Bi-Polar, for those who dont know, this is a serious mental illness, that can bring on extremley serious bouts of depression, which can often lead to suicidal tendancies. She has been on various anti depressants to control the illness, and has been waiting to see a Pyschiatrist since last November.\n\nLast night she made an attempt on her life, by overdosing on a cocktail of anti depressants, pain killers and whisky. After phoning 999 and giving them the drugs names and approximate quantities, the ambulance finaly arrived nearly 40 minutes later! I should point out, we live a mere 10 minutes from the Royal Gwent, however I was expecting the ambulance to arrive in less time than that, and was under the impression that she would be in medical hands sooner by using the 999 service. \n\nApproximatley an hour after the 999 call was placed, the ambulance arrived at The Royal Gwent. I drove myself in the car, and arrived 10 minutes BEFORE the ambulance. By now it was midnight. The paramedic crew then led us into the A&E waiting corridor, where we joing a queue of numerous beds, trolleys and wheelchairs. Having never been to hospital in an ambulance, or accompanied anyone in an ambulance, I had been under the impression that ambulance arrivals always saw the Triage nurse immediatley upon arrival. Obviously not, or atleast in the case of The Royal Gwent, weather this is the same with all hospital's I have no idea. Upon speaking to my partner it became evident that no medical care had been administered in the ambulance. At the time, I took this as a good sign, as they must of been under the impression that she had not taken enough medicine to do serious damage.\n\nAfter waiting in the corridor for about 30 minutes, we were seen. Temperature, and pulse rate was taken, as was an ECG. At this point I was asked to wait in the waiting area and was told my fiance would be shown where I was after the ECG. So an hour and a half after a 999 call was placed for an overdose, the overdoseee was having there pulse taken. And nothing else! \n\nAround 10 minutes later my fiance joined me in the waiting area. I asked her what they had done, and was told about the ECG, and that she didnt know what was happen, as she had just been told to wait. So we waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. It became evident that my belief that she had not consumed enough to any serious physical damage was correct, as no treatment had been given, so we started to believe that we would be sent home soon.\n\nAt 02:30, after being left in the waiting area for nealy 1 3/4 hours with no communication and no idea what was going on, we decided to go and find a nurse to find out what was happening. At this point they decided to take her blood, and I was asked to go wait in the waiting area again. Weather or not they were about to call her, or weather they only took her blood then because we had gone to find them is unclear, however I am inclined to believe the latter. When she returned, my partner told me that they had taken blood, and she waiting to see the doctor, and there was one person ahead of her in the list. By the time the doctor called her it was around 3am. It had taken FOUR HOURS from the initial 999 call to be seen by a doctor and recieve anything resembling medical treatment, other than tests a GP can perform, or even a semi competant person could perform at home with the right equipment, which is readily available to buy.\n\nThe doctor however did not provide any treatment. I should point out that my partner had taken an overdose a few years previously, and NONE of the things that were done to her on the first occasion, were done last night. This of course cemented our belief that the quantites taken were not life threatening, and we would be sent home at some point. After seeing the doctor, who gave no treatment, but merley spoke to her, my partner informed me that he was going to speak to the Pyschiatrist, and then wait for the blood test results before taking any further action, and we were to wait in the waiting area, again. By 3:30 in the morning, after sitting round in the hospital doing nothing, and having very little done my fiance was beginning to get fed up and bored and wanting to go home. After another 15 minutes of waiting, and 45 minutes after last seeing the doctor and an hour and a quater after her blood tests, again we went looking for the nurses for some information as to what was happening, and we were told to return to the waiting area to wait. At this point my fiance decided that all she wanted to do was go home to bed. I was reluctant to agree and suggested she would be better waiting in hospital until she was given the all clear, but after assureing me she felt ok and promising to phone the doctor to make an appointment first thing in the morning I agreed, so off we went to find someone to tell them we were off home. It was at this point we were told she could not self discharge. Although they were powerless to physicaly stop us leaving, should we do so, they were legally obligied to phone the police, who would then come to our home and arrest her under the mental health act. Naturaly we sat back down. A short while later, merely 5 minutes, my fiance was called. She was told that she was being kept in and they were finding a bed for her. It had taken them nearly four hours to decide to keep her in, so the Pyschiatrist could speak to her in the morning. I told her I would wait until they found her a bed before going home. She told me that they couldnt find me a bed so they were going to give her one in A&E. As I could see atleast 2 empty beds from where we were sitting I thought this was immeninant so left her and went home to bed, as I had an interview at 10am the following day, less than 6 hours time. My girlfriend assured me she would phone me as soon as she had any news in the morning.\n\nAfter my interview I phoned the hospital for news as to what was happening. After speaking to 2 different departments who both told me at first that she was no longer with them, and then she had never been with them, I was put through to A&E. They informed me that she had gone home at 9:45. I told them we lived together, and she wasnt home and I was due to pick her up myself. We had forgotten to pick up her mobile when she went in the ambulance, and as such I couldnt phone her directly. I was told by the person on the other end of the line that she would find out and put me on hold. After being on hold for 20 minutes I logged on to Facebook and recieved a message from my fiances brother, telling me she needed picking up from the hospital. This had been sent at 11am, 1 1/4 hours after the she had apparently gone home. I hung up the phone and drove to the hospital, planning to go to reception to being the hunt, as I had no idea where in the hospital she required picking up from. \n\nMy fiance was waiting for me by the gate, where she had been since 9:30am. Some two hours. I asked what had happened and what had been said. She told me she wasnt given a bed, and had to wait in the waiting area, on hard plastic seats. Yet again, she had gone to find the nurses to get something done. I had left her at 4am, and at 8am after a mere half hour sleep, no-one had spoken to her or informed her what was happening. At 8am she was told she would get breakfast soon and then the Pyschiatrist would see her. She got no breakfast, but she was seen by the Pyschiatrist at around 9am.\n\nHaving been kept in hospital against her will overnight I would of expected a full 20-30 minute consultation, possibly a prescription and an appointment for a follow interview. What actualy happened was very little. The conversation was around 15 minutes, and the result was my fiance being given the phone number for \"Mind\" the mental health charity, and told to phone them, see if she can get any help from them, and that her GP would be informed. With that she was told she could go home. Only she couldnt get home. After being told she couldnt get hospital transport home and would have to find her own way home she tried phoning me, but couldnt remember my number. She then phoned her dad, who lives in Taunton, and asked him to phone me, but he dosent have my number. She was left potentialy stranded. The only good thing The Royal Gwent did all night was to allow her to use there phone to try and get a lift home. After this they allowed her to go outside on her own with out any knowledge of how she was getting home.\n\nThis in itself I find wholley irresponsible. We have a person with history of mental illness, on a waiting list to see a Pyschiatrist being allowed to wander off on her own less than 12 hours after a 2nd suicide attempt in 4 years after recieving little to no treatment.\n\nIn my view the way my fiance was uncared for and unlooked after and untreated is disgusting. There was no information passed along to us, and the only time she was seen in any way was when we went looking and pestered ourselves. Basicaly they didnt seem to care one jot, and rather than viewing my partner as someone who needed help, if not medical than mental, I feel that she was treated as an insignificance.  No respect. No Information. No Care.\n\nIf my partner ever needs any kind of medical treatment again, I wont be bothering with 999 and risk being taken to the Royal Gwent again, I'll take my chances and drive her to The University of Wales Hospital Heath in cardiff myself. \n\nWords can not fully truly or accuratley describe my disgust with the Royal Gwent Hospital. I feel that calling it a Hospital in the first place is laughable enough.  \n\nDisgusted, absolutely disgusted!", "Just quickly don't expect much from my spelling or grammar, its late and I just want to get my message across about how I feel The Cherrywood Clinic and the unseen doctor with their team of professionals have, in my opinion, failed me and my depression. \n\nI think I was 17 when I was first sent to his place. I suffer from depression and have on many occasions been through panic attacks, break downs and considered suicide. I haven't had an appointment since last September, they have sent me regular apologies of how my latest appointment has been cancelled and have moved me to a more suited time slot for the next month, so its been 10 months altogether since they last saw me. Obviously the doctor (whoever they are, they've never talked to me personally, as far as I'm aware they just sign documents which I feel is in attempt to make it look like they're doing something) has got more urgent cases than someone who is right now considering killing himself.\n\nWhen they did see me (some time last year) I would wait in the 1970's waiting area alone until called to see the doctor, who could be anyone - during every visit a new nameless face would take me to an empty room and ask me who I was. I would be asked how I was and as far as I can tell it didn't really matter if I said \u201cI'm ok\u201d or \u201cI want to kill myself\u201d I would be given a cold smile and questioned slightly about why I felt that way then told to either carry on taking the tablets (which are fantastic they just knock me out and make me stop caring about everything, I turn into a zombie, everyone seems happy) or to higher my amount taken. That's it, that's all I'm told before being asked to leave and come back in a month. I have asked if I can leave as they have never helped me in any way but I just get told to come back. I wanted to get off the tablets but they're addictive and apparently I would need some kind of rehab type help from the doctor and his colleagues (sadly they have never helped me so I managed to do it myself and that was hard). \n\nThere's lots of things I could say about this service and how I hate them for leaving me without help when I was promised it but I haven't really got time. Since going to see the Cherrywood people I have been diagnosed with several different mental health problems which feels very random, the best one being asperger's syndrome. My mum used the word asperger's once when she came and next month my newest doctor opened up a file and casually mention that I had be diagnosed with asperger's syndrome - news to me! But when the unseen doctor sent my university evidence and some special needs asperger's syndrome was on there, I've stopped caring.\n\nI'm not going to write or phone the doctor as it gets me angry and I\u2018ll either break down or swear too much, I'm getting worked up now. I'm dealing with my depression alone and its hard without the pills, it's a horrible world but I have to deal with that. The NHS has made me feel lonelier, not better. Who can you go to when the doctor doesn't seem to care?\n\nI'd like to end with saying that I'm not mad or insane but they have made me feel that, I now giggle watching one flew over the cuckoo's nest because I feel Jack Nicolson got lucky, atleast Nurse Ratched talked to him. \n\nVery few people know how depressed I am right now if anyone at all. People wont talk about suicide, it scares them and they assume you just want attention, so right now all I have is me and that scares me.\n", "I have been in severe distress with growing suicide ideation.  I spoke to the local out of hours Crisis Team (the person I spoke to was brilliant).  This person suggested that I book an appointment with my ex consultant (no longer under his care) as I needed help.  \n\nNotes on the local computer system said that my ex consultant had welcomed me making an appointment if ever I needed to see him so I was not imagining this part.  I tried to do this only to find that he had had a complete turn around and would only see my if the CPN thought it necessary.  \n\nI do not have an appointment with this CPN for another 2 weeks so by then the \"crisis\" will either be over or I might take a more successful overdose this time (my husband caught me attemtping suicide).  In the end it was suggested that I visit our local Adult MH Services duty desk which I have done.  The person I saw was lovely, kind and listened.  They said that I am having a crisis at the moment, would write out a report and ensure my ex consultant and CPN get a copy.  What they will do with that information I do not know.\n\nI have a WRAP and am well aware of \"mindfulness\" but was past being able to use either.\n\nIt took a lot of courage for me to call even the Crisis Team because I have huge guilt issues over wasting the healthcare system's time in that somebody more deserving needs their help or because I feel that I am a fraud who is about to get caught out (healthcare professionals constantly reassure me that neither is true).\n\nBecause of the reaction of my ex consultant I now feel even more worthless and even more guilty for making any calls in the first place.  I feel as if they now think I am making things up (which I am not) and should either be ignored or wiped away.  I feel let down by the system just when I needed it most.\n\nMaybe if I was the sort of patient / service user that created a fuss all the time I would be listened to and helped through.", "Thank you for taking the time to forward your feedback on the care received your friend received whilst an in-patient on ward 12 at Heartlands hospital.

Everything was fine for 2.5 years until I contacted a severe infection as follows:\nAdmitted to Wythenshawe hospital in June 2009, with severe pain in hip.   Put on intravenous antibiotics and bed rest.  Various tests. Near the end of 4th week, hip was aspirated but because of intravenous antibiotics the infection had been masked and it was unclear what the infection was.  At my request I was discharged to Wrightington Hospital on in mid July and put on intravenous vancomycin.  I had a reaction to vancomycin, having a red rash over my body, my legs swelled and I had to wear surgical stockings.\nI was discharged t the start of August 2009 from Wrightington with 4 weeks supply of antibiotics, Linzolid and Rifampacin, and had to have weekly blood tests at my GPs surgery.\nA week after finishing the above antibiotics I was again in severe pain and had to take painkillers again.  \n\nAttended an outpatient appointment at Wrightington Hospital at the start of September 2009, had a blood test and given another appointment for late October 2009. At this appointment couldn't bear my hip to be touched. \n\nTold to return the next day for an aspiration on my hip.  Prescribed Linzolid again for 2 weeks.  Pain returned within a week after I had finished the antibiotics.\n\nAt the beginning December attended Wrightington Hospital and was prescribed erythromycin for 4 weeks.   \nAttended Wrightington hospital outpatients at the very end of  December because I was still taking antibiotics, was asked to return on the towards the end of January.\nFinished erythromycin on Friday 1 January 2010, pain returned and I rang my GP to request painkillers a week later.\n\nI had an Outpatient appointment in January 2010, it was decided that I needed to have my hip re-done.\n\nAt the beginning of February, visited my GP, was prescribed erythromycin for 4 weeks.\nFinished 4 week course of erythromycin on at the beginning of March. After two days  pain returned much more severe.  I could hardly walk.\n\nI started a 4 week course of antibiotics, still in severe pain, taking paracetamol as well as the antibiotics until the antibiotics work.\n\nI went to Wrightington Hospital on Friday 19th April for pre-op tests.\nStill on antibiotics. I then received letter from Wrightington informing me my blood was abnormal and I was being taken off the waiting list.\nMy doctor put me on Iron tablets then told me to stop taking them.\n\nHad a blood test on in early May and saw the doctor a few days later.  My iron levels normal, blood count abnormal.  \n\nWent to Wrightington Hospital for another pre-op test.\nOn Erythromycin 250mg caps x 4 per day (been on erythromycin for nearly 6 months and antibiotics altogether for 11 months)\nThyroxine 100mcg   1 per day\nHad my hip removed on June 2010, was told new hip would be put in within 6 to 12 weeks.\nAfter3 out patient appointment I spoke to the Doctor, who said they would send me a letter to confirm date of having my hip put back in.\n\nAt the beginning of October, phoned Wrightington Hosp re operation, going to send me letter to have pre-op tests.\n12 days later I received letter re pre-op appt for early November. Between attending this appointment and the end of the I rang on 3 separate occasions to see if I had a date for the operations. I was told someone would call me back and they never did\n\nEarly January 2011 I received letter from Wrightington with date for 2nd pre-operation tests book for later that month.\n\nA couple of days after receiving this letter I also received a letter with date for having my hip put back in. This was scheduled for the very end of January.\n\n10 days before my scheduled operation the surgeon phoned to tell me that I was not having my hip put back in as there was still some infected bone cement to remove and that he and and another surgeon would be operating to remove this.  Was also told that my hip would be replaced in a matter of weeks not months.  \n\nI was discharged from hospital at the beginning of February.  Everything was ok, but only problem I had was that after the district nurse took the stitches out one of the stitch wounds took a little longer to heal.\n\nA month after the operation I returned to outpatients to see the doctor who took a swab and arranged for the district nurse to come back until the stitch area had healed.  The Doctor's secretary rang to say there was a slight infection and to continue with antibiotics and the district nurses visits.  I was discharged by the district nurses the following month.\n.\nAt the end of March I returned to Wrightington Outpatient and told to come back in two months.\nI returned to Wrightington and told to come back again in 8 weeks.  We were very upset at this as we had thought we would be told a date for the hip to be put back in.  \n\nMid May we phoned the doctor's secretary as we were very upset that we had made 90 mile round trip just to be told to come back in 8 weeks.\nIn July we returned to Outpatients, and we were told the hip would be put back in within 4-6 weeks.  The surgeon told us that he thought it would be done sooner.\nAfter waiting for the post with an appointment we phoned admissions and was told that I everything was booked up until the middle of September and I was not even on the list.  We then phoned the doctor's secretary who told us she would look into and phone us back.  She phoned us back two days later and told us the date of the pre-op and the date of the operation \u2013 both mid August, and a letter was in the post to confirm this.\nI went for my pre-op and was told to ring the ward on 3 days before the operation to check that everything was ok for admission. At 5pm on this day we received a call to tell us that due to a family bereavement the operation had been cancelled.  Although disappointed we could understand why it was cancelled.  We were told there was to be a meeting and we would be contacted.  We waited the afternoon after the planned meeting and then phoned admissions and were told again everything was booked up until the middle of September.  We phoned the doctor's secretary and she told us that it was being dealt with by the management and someone would get back to us with another date.\n\nWe had a call from the Admissions Manager a few days later. to tell us the new date was at the End of September.\n\n\nI am sending this on behalf of my husband who does not want to complain but I would like to ask:\n\nWhy my husband was on antibiotics for 12 months?\n\n While I can understand why the operation was cancelled, why has he got to wait another 4 weeks to have his hip put back in again?\n\n He has been on crutches now for 14 months and no one sees the struggles he has to get about on these.  He has calluses on his hands and bruises on his arms from the crutches and struggles to get up the stairs to the bedroom.  He can't get in the shower because it is over the bath.  He never complains but I know how much he has gone through in the last 2 years.  I am sorry that this story is so long but I did not want to go through the complaints procedure as we have always been very happy with the doctors and nurses and realise how much they do.  \n", "We are very sorry, and disappointed, to hear that your experience at Wrightington Hospital has fallen short of what we would wish for our patients.\r\n\r\nIf you and your husband would like to contact the Patient Relations Department on 01942 822376 and we will be able to look at how we can resolve these issues for you both", "In January, 2009, I joined the ranks of those men who will die in the near future, in my view, needlessly from cancer that emanated from the Prostate gland. \n\nMy initial complaint to the Health centre involved was met with: 'Sorry about that, hope everything works out and that you receive the appropriate treatment.'   I had written a letter of complaint to my surgery in  Plymouth, because over the proceeding ten months I had seen four different doctors there; through 2008, with ever increasing pain in the the lower body and legs. It took a fifth doctor, at the same surgery, to examine me in January, 2009, for a possible Prostate problem which was confirmed four days later - too late as cancer had spread into the local skeleton and lower spine. My nerves leading to and in my feet were irrepairable damaged through 2008.  (PSA 975, Gleeson 4+4). \n\nIn 2002, I believe that every GP was sent a Prostate Risk Management Pack.  Six years on, when I needed the contents of that Pack, through 2008, it was not applied. The above story is by no means unique in playing a part in the avoidable 10,000 deaths (as outlined by the 10000 men charity) that were misdiagnosed over a similiar period of time at various surgeries in various Foundation Trusts around the UK.   See www.10000men.org \n\nMy complaints to the British Medical Council and the Plymouth Health Trust met with the same tactic: 'Sorry to hear about your problems hope that you receive the appropriate treatment', and nothing more. Just what is the 'appropriate treatment' supposed to be when due to the fatal time lapse between bringing a medical problem to your local medical expert's attention and in my view their ineptitude in not responding quickly.  \n\nJust what kind of treatment is left? For myself and the other 9,999 men in my batch getting ready for departure, there was nothing left of a life-saving nature. We have had to endure female hormone treatment, radiotherapy and chemotherapy all of which, have in my experience caused horrendous side-effects, and lead to financial ruin and a slow death.\n ", "The Divisional Director for Adult Mental Health has now provided the following response:\r\n'Thank you for your feedback and I am sorry to hear about your situation.

I did not contact the hospital as I knew the contractions needed to be 3-5 minutes apart and I needed to be at least 4cm dilated or I would be sent home again.\nThey settled down until the next evening and by the early hours of the day after they were 3 minutes apart so I rang the Triage Ward at Queens Hospital.\nI was asked where the pain was and I said 'down low, very painful and the pains were 3 minutes apart' as I'd been sat in my kitchen timing them!\nThe Triage Nurse replied that that's just normal pregnancy cramps and to call back when the real pains started up high.\u00a0I told her that they had started up high the day before and I knew the labour had started properly but she insisted that I stay at home and wait for it to start properly. My sister and I decided against that advice and made our way to Queens Hospital.\nI arrived there at 2:30am and after being examined I was 4cm dilated and the labour had started. I had quite a sick labour and was on Gas & Air to begin with, but had stated in my birth plan that if I wasn't coping with the Gas & Air alone I would like an epidural.\nI was waiting in the triage ward for 2-3 hours for a bed on the labour ward to become available, when I did eventually get a bed I was made to get up and walk to the room where I was to give birth \u2013 whilst vomiting.\nI was then greeted by the midwife who would be delivering me. Her attitude right from the beginning was utterly appalling. She did not speak to me at all for the first 20 minutes or so, just groaned when I was asking her questions. \nMy sister who was my birthing partner asked if my robe could be changed as I had been very sick on it and it smelt disgusting \u2013 the midwife refused and told her to leave it.\nOnce the labour was in full swing I was in pain and still using the Gas and Air. The Midwife told me not to use the Gas & Air when I wasn't in pain as it was a waste. I started to feel that I wanted to push but she kept telling me I wasn't ready. I asked her to examine me and see how dilated I was - she refused as due to Health and Safety, and said I could only be examined every 4 hours.\nI was starting to lose my temper and said I couldn't resist the urge to push and please, please could she examine me, so she did and said I was 10cm dilated and so ready to start pushing at which point she took the Gas & Air off me and I now had no pain relief. I was trying to keep hold of the gas & air and she physically ripped it from my hand and said No.\nWithin half an hour of no pain relief I was really struggling and asked for the epidural. I was refused this as there may not be enough time and the anaesthetist would be at least half an hour as he was too busy. I had a drip put in my hand should the anaesthetist become available. This was not kept an eye on and during the birth was twisted round in my wrist and made my wrist balloon and eventually go black.\nWhilst pushing and trying to give birth, the midwife stood leaning against the wall about a foot away from me with her arms crossed telling me to \u201cclose your mouth, I don't want to hear that noise\u201d and \u201churry up, my shift is finished in 45 minutes and I'm tired and want to go home\u201d.\nShe was not in the slightest bit encouraging and told me to just push like I was going to the toilet and just kept repeating the word \u201ctoilet\u201d.\nMy waters were not breaking so I had to ask her over and over again to break them for me. When she did the waters were a very green colour \u2013 my baby had done a poo in my waters as he was distressed and decided she was going to perform an episiotomy as the baby kept slipping back up. My sister was at the end of my bed at this point and asked the midwife why she was struggling when making the incision. The Midwife replied saying \u201cJesus Christ, these scissors are blunt\u201d from what I can gather she should have gone and got a completely new surgical pack but instead she continued hacking away and 30 mins later my son was born.\nThe paediatrician came in and said he was 'grunting' as he was slightly distressed and needed to be brought up to the correct temperature so was put under the heater.\nThe midwife had already left her shift and gone home, leaving my cut open and bleeding heavily. My partner at this point went to find someone to come and stitch up the incision and demanded to know why she had made such a mess of it. Eventually someone came in to do the stitches and explained to us that the midwife had used blunt scissors and she would now have to stitch up the incision but also do some cosmetic stitching as she had torn me in 5 places. Whilst trying to stitch me up it ripped open again as it couldn't hold so some of it had to be left in the hope it would heal on its own.\nAfter giving birth I had to wait nearly all day for a bed on the Post-Natal ward. I was then kept in for 3 days completely unnecessarily. I began to feel very stressed, I found the attitudes of some of the midwives on the post-natal ward absolutely disgusting. Some of them didn't even speak when coming in your room, or just grunted at you when you spoke to them.\nMy episiotomy was quite sore by the 2nd day and I was taking the 2 paracetamol when they were brought round and offered but by the evening of the 2nd day there, I was refused them when they were brought round as I should be careful how many I take. I hadn't even had the six in 24 hours and was in pain.\nBy the 3rd day I was in tears. Someone came round to check my pulse and blood pressure \u2013 my pulse was very high, no-one would let me go home or even come and explain anything to me. The last day I was there I had no breakfast offered, had to go and find something to eat.\nThe midwife that discharged me was so rude to me, I think I can honestly say I have never been spoken to in such a rude manner as I was that day, made even worse still by the fact that I was feeling so vulnerable and needed reassurance. My partner was finally allowed to come and pick me up that evening.\nMy partner can verify, I broke down in tears when I got home. In the following fortnight I had to have two courses of antibiotics as I had an infection in the incision and could not sit down properly for 2 weeks nor bend over or bath properly, going to the toilet was like urinating on an open wound which was so painful.\nSome of the outside skin that had to be left un-stitched has now healed over the stitches (that I was told would dissolve but they haven't) and I am still having pains and twinges when I am sitting down for too long or walking long distances.\nFrom a personal point of view I can only describe the feelings over those 3 days as like being on trial and locked up in the meantime. I should have been able to enjoy my baby but I felt I was being scrutinised the whole time. I do feel emotionally scarred by the whole experience. Giving birth is a very daunting experience at the best of times, especially being my first baby, I pushed so hard to sort out housing because I wanted the best for my baby and I knew I needed to be organised for when he arrived and did not want to even temporarily be in a hostel.\nNone of this was helped by the fact I have no mum around to support me at all, and having to deal with it all alone is what I find most difficult. I will also be honest and admit that I am also now almost too scared to seek any help like counselling or speak to any Health Visitors about any problems I may have as I just feel I would almost be being judged and made to feel inadequate as a parent which I know 100% is not the case.\nI am suffering now in silence, cried over the experience a few times and will not feel better about any of it overnight. I would like this looked into, and am planning on aiming for compensation for the way I was treated and how I've been left feeling \u2013 especially now I feel like I'm alone and like I cannot trust healthcare professionals.\nI cannot name any of the midwives, despite ringing and asking for that information I have been refused more than once, and told if I want to see my notes I will be charged. I am certainly not paying for that information.", "My best friend had prostate trouble and was sent by the Homerton to St.Bart's for radio therapy (31 sessions) in October last year. The treatment went fine but about January of this year he began to have very bad pains in his stomach. He returned to the Homerton several times but was told that his PSI was less than 1% and that the pains were part of the healing process.\n\nI brought him to his Consultant and to A&E several times over the next three months and on every occasion was assured that things would settle down. In early May this year things got so bad that we insisted that a doctor come down to A&E and check him. This doctor asked if we knew what the result of the final CAT scan was (there was nothing on file). What CAT scan? They brought him immediately for a scan.\n\nIt turned out that my friend had cancer of the liver, the spleen and the spine that a CAT scan would have picked up if given. He had been dealing with these cancers with only Paracetamol for over three months. He died three days later.\n\nI doubt if a scan would have prolonged his life but at least he could have been treated for the pain. His Executor was not inclined \"to make a fuss\" so the whole sorry affair was ignored. ", "I went into chelsea and westminster hospital at 10 am in the morning with light brown spotting, pain and cramping at 8 weeks pregnant.  I was examined initially by one excellent doctor who was thorough and precise. Unfortunately in my opinion he was the only decent doctor I saw.   I asked for a scan immediately and was informed that only if necessary would I get a scan.  I said I really really wanted to have one.  He understood and told me to trust him and that he would always fight my corner but may not succeed, even with a threatened misscarriage. \n\nIt took two hours after having seen him to get my urine dipped to confirm a urinary tract infection and a threatened miscarriage.  I was however told that my womb was closed at this point.  I then had to wait a further 6 hours to see another doctor who did the exact same examination and wanted to admit me to a ward.  I still at this point was given no medication for my Urinary Tract Infection which I have had confirmed by my private doctor that it can cause miscarriage.  You can also look at any reference material on a UTI and it will state that it can cause miscarriage. All the doctors I saw in that hospital stated that a UTI could not cause miscarriage. \n\nThey wanted to admit me at 8 pm to have a scan in the morning. They could not do a scan that evening.  For some bizarre reason they don't have a 24 hour scanning facility despite the fact that they have a large maternity ward and that ectopic pregnancies can be fatal if not detected.  I wanted to go home.  They persuaded me by saying that even though neither of them thought it was an ectopic pregnancy,  if something happened to me that they would want to examine me and potentially rush me into theatre if i haemmoraged. \n\nI stayed and was put on a ward with four women. Two eighty year old women who I believe were dying, and two others who must have had some form of gynacological problems.  All of them snored, the nurses were loud and cackling telling jokes all night.  I couldn't sleep was a nervous wreck and exhausted.  Exactly the reason I wanted to stay at home... to sleep.\n\nI miscarried at 5:30 that morning.  I requested to see the doctor and informed the ward nurses that i believed i had miscarried.  I was bleeding and in pain.  I called for the doctor.  The doctor refused to examine me and said I should just wait until 11 am in the morning when my scan was scheduled.  I asked the doctor why on earth I had to stay on the ward, if they wouldn't even examine me to confirm that i was indeed miscarrying and if my womb had opened or if it was closed.  The doctor seemed to have no interest.  I was exasperated. I went down to A and E to see if I could find another doctor to examine me, but because I had already been admitted, i was refused.\n\nAt around 8 am a team of doctors arrived, one older with four doctors who were so young I thought they were students coming around to my bed and started asking questions.  I told the senior doctor that I didn't want a bunch of students standing around my bed. (they all looked about 12 years old)  He ignored the sensitivity of the situation which I found to be quite traumatic having just miscarried and not really wanting an entourage. The senior doctor merely said 'They're doctors, not students\" and proceeded to ask quesstions. I was so upset, traumatised and shocked that I ended up feeling bullied into agreeding to talk to all of these strangers about how I had miscarried. \n\nI then had to wait another 3 hours until the scan.  There was only a sac with no fetal pole or heartbeat. I was told I would naturally miscarry, which i proceeded to do over the next several days. \n\nThey discharged me and forgot to give me my medication.  I called up the hospital and asked for the medication.  They said (this was at around 2 pm I left the hospital before midday) that they had not written up the discharge papers and I would have to wait for the doctor and they would contact me with my prescription. This never happened.\n\nLater that afternoon i was rushed back to the Hospital - this time I choose Kingston not bearing the thought of going back to C + W.  They were surprised by the choice of medicine prescribed because I didn't have a straight forward UTI as I was initially told, I had a kidney infection and was screaming in pain.   I was initially at C+ W put on Cefelexin.  They took me immediately off that and put me on Trimetheprim.  Three days later having had enough of hospital and not getting any better, I called a private doctor.  The doctor said both sets had got it wrong, that Cefelexin wasn't strong enough, and Trimetheprim had formed a well known resistance in the Wandsworth area.  So she prescribed Augmentin.  Less than 10 hours later I felt right as rain and then proceeded to recover. \n\nThe insensitivity, lack of care and what I feel is general ineptitude of the staff I saw in C+W make me never want to go back to a hospital and the entire experience is making me second guess ever wanting to be pregnant again.  I believe 80% of the trauma of the miscarriage was actually caused by the hospital.", "Dear Sir/Madam,\n                         The following incidences occurred during my brothers fatal association with the world of psychiatry. \n\u2022\tDespite the insistence of my brother and family members regarding his emotional well-being. My brother, was drugged and hence, we feel he was coerced into accepting the scourge of anti-psychotic medication into his life by Clatterbridge hospital, Wirral. \n\u2022\tDuring periods of medication stoppage, my brother experienced severe cognitive difficulties. Consequently, his personal safety was put at risk\n\u2022\tAppeals were made for increased monitoring.   \n\u2022\tWe feel hospital staff were entirely unresponsive to these appeals.\n\u2022\tMy brother jumped from a high vantage point, following a medication stoppage.

My experience of the assessment - conducted by a 'psychoanalytical psychotherapist' -  was utterly traumatic and appalling, and continues to disturb me psychologically today.  I felt that the therapist used sinister techniques throughout (so you lied, so you put on an act, . . and continued to use these techniques through the three assessment sessions, despite having herself diagnosed this as being unsettling for me). They showed no sensitivity whatsoever to the fact that I was feeling suicidal - when I revealed some of my plans she replied \"well of course you'd want to make sure they were fail safe if you were intent on [committing suicide]. I felt that they were cavalier beyond words, and placed me under severe psychological duress to comply to thier narratives of my life, rather than my own. \n\nThey categorically refused to give me the CMHT 24-hr Crisis Number, despite having had to admit myself to a Suicide Respite Centre over the late April Bank Holiday weekend (I had to do this because I was not given the crisis number by the CMHT manager, despite having complained to the Local Authority (because calls from CMHT were not returned) that I was feeling suicidal. My complaint is currently being investigated by the Clinical Director, but I wish to bring it to the attention of this site, because  I am concerned that different evidence now seems to be coming to light, after having made the complaint. I now have two very differently worded assessment reports, both bearing the same date - but one claiming to my GP I attended my last assessment session; the other with an added note, admitting that I did not. I request for an explanation for this. I specifically requested Art Therapy treatment, as I know that I do not respond well to one-to-one talking therapy of any kind (Art Therapy was also recommended as suitable for me in writing, by the Suicide Respite Centre), but have yet to be able to access this (we seem to keep going round in circles with referrals here). \n\nMy main point is that psychotherapists are 'self-regulated', and in my view operate by acquiring psychological power and control over their patients, and using sinister techniques to get them to comply to their narratives, with no care for the consequences, whereas art therapists are state-regulated healthcare professionals. I raised my concerns about this therapist directly after the first session but was placed under pressure to continue seeing them(they still seem to be under the highly deluded impression that I was 'upset' that they cancelled a session; I simply just never wanted to see them again and to be referred to someone more suitable) . Until my referral to the CMH,  I felt I was receiving excellent care from my GP, but this has been a real wake-up call to the appalling treatment anyone with mental health problems may face from a CMHT. I cannot express in words how disgusted I am by the treatment received from this psychotherapist, and the psychological damage I feel it has caused me. I hope this forewarns patients who are referred to this CMHT what they may expect in an assessment, and to help them understand the sinister practices that in my experience were used by psychoanalytical psychotherapists and the CMHT. \n\nI hope to receive some transparent answers and responsible treatment following my formal complaint, but must say, at this stage I have zero faith in this service and its complaints process. I would advise future users of this service to communicate everything in writing and to keep meticulous records of all communication. I also encourage anyone who feel they have been harmed by a psychotherapist to contact the Clinic for Boundary Studies and support their work to make psychotherapists state-regulated (this was due to happen under the old government regime, but not yet under the new coalition).", "I was taken into A & E with concussion.   They were good there but in the ward I thought the attitude was bad.  I needed the toilet, and was told it was in the corridor, I said I could not stand up or even put pressure on my feet, I was told I could.   My alarm was hooked over my trolley table and every time the nurse came to me to do tests she pushed it out of the way, I could not send for help.   There was a dirty glass half full of water on that trolley, it was out of reach.   I was not offered one hot drink or any clean water from ten at night until the day shift came on, they were good, washed me, gave me a hot drink, asked if I wanted breakfast.\n\nI asked for home situation to be taken into account before discharge because my husband has serious mobility problems, and difficulty using his hands.  It felt like nobody took any notice of what I said, I was discharged into the care of a man who was awaiting spinal surgery.\n\nMY GP is a caring and competent doctor, she was shocked I had not had a brain scan, so arranged one, it turned out I had a mini stroke, yet a nurse had told me I could walk, and deal with my own toilet needs. I never saw  the person in charge of the ward. \n\nTo put it bluntly, when I insisted on a commode when I had finished she said \"get back into bed then\"   I could not move myself.  She manhandled me, and I told her my bum should be wiped first.   She gave me two little bits of tissue, I had to do it myself, she did not clean my hands till I told her they were stained with you know what, and could cause hospital infection.\n\nIt was fifteen months before I was well enough to report it, it turns out the time limit to report it locally is twelve months.   I couldn't, I was not well enough.\n\nMy husband has needed occasional hospital care including surgery for over 40 years.  In my opinion some wards are very good, some are a disgrace.\n", "My Mum passed away in Heartlands hospital late last year.\nShe made the decision not to have any more dialysis as it was not helping so we got to spend some quality time before she passed away.\nPrevious to this my Mom kept telling me that she was being abused by three members of staff. I thought she was just confused and i shamefully told her not to be silly.\nIt was only when another patient and her family pulled me to one side and told me that what Mom was saying was true that i took it seriously. I was devastated to think that i ignored my Mom when she needed me most.\nI reported these staff, and to this day i have heard nothing about what has been done to stop these so-called carers from inflicting harm on someone else's loved ones. To be totally honest i have tried to block it out as i get too upset. Selfish I know, but it is too late for my Mom now.\nThe majority of the staff were wonderful, including the haemodialysis department. Some of the lovely staff came to say goodbye to Mom in her last few hours and really did care about her, they are the true angels.\nSadly, another lady lost her Mother too on the same ward the day before mine, and i have since found out that she complained about two of the same staff as well.\nThe only thing that gets me through this is the fact that i believe in Karma and what goes around comes around.", "What was supposed to be a day case procedure has now turned into a 4 week epic. My partner walked into Corbett's to have a caudal epidural- an injection to ease back pain and was told he'd be back at home for his lunch.  He felt the needle go in and was in severe pain. I was phoned to say he had been 'dead-legged' and I shouldn't worry, he'd be back to normal within 24 hrs, but failed to tell me that everyone else had got up and gone home. It took them 5 hours to transfer him to Russell's Hall. He had no feeling in both legs for 3 days, then got movement back in his one leg. He is now reliant on 2 crutches and a wheelchair to get about. \n\nI've had no explanation of what's wrong with him and his expected recovery time. The consultant did speak to him, but my other half was so spaced out on morphine and painkillers, he can't remember what was said to him. I've never even spoken to a consultant/ doctor and I'm down as his next of kin.  He's been rushed back in through a referral from a physio, still no doctor nor consultant. No explanation of whats wrong and if/when he'll recover. We're absolutely furious and anxious as this affects not just the patient but all our family.

I was in there for a month, sectioned for no reason in my opinion, took there by police. \nAnother thing there was nothing I could do about being sectioned apparently according to soliciters. Until I was in hospital I couldn't do anything to get out, my understanding is that that's the law. I think this is ridiculous. \nI got put in seclusion for no reason as far as I could tell, I was forced to take meds or threatened with injection. It felt like nobody explained what was goin on, I was just left in a room for hours locked in without a drink.

My GP asked for me to be seen within 3 days \u2013 I waited 2 weeks. I was told I could not be taken on by the CMHT, and felt it was because I was working and well-dressed. What I found worse, was that I had to call them to find this out as I was never told of the outcome of the assessment. \nI tried to tell a team member I was seriously suicidal and at risk of doing something but it is very, very difficult to talk about these things and I was scared of being sectioned. They did not give me the impression of taking the suicidal thoughts and intent seriously but was dismissive and told me that because I had said the thoughts were lessening, I was safe although I clearly said I wasn't. I ended up making 2 attempts within 2 weeks.\n", "After an admission to hospital  the HTT refused to take me on, in what I found to be a very rude manner. I had been placed under their care following an overdose. Less than two weeks later I again attempted suicide. I felt I had made my feelings clear to the HTT and they did not act.\nI found both of the staff that assessed me in hospital both very rude and unhelpful. One asked the other 'what did she do?' to which she replied '*superficially* cut her wtists', emphasis on the superficially. I think it is very rude and demeaning to speak about someone in that way when they were there and also I think they knew what I had done to be admitted and they were just saying my attempt was not serious. \n\nActually I was trying to kill myself and was interrupted by police and paramedics. It is not easy to cut your wrists, I am sorry my attempt was so inept. I have self-harmed since then and that comment and other ones by paramedics and police make me feel like cutting more deeply and that I have never sought medical treatment for fear of a similar nasty, dismissive and uncaring reaction so will be left with scars.\n\nI was told that I had said I found it difficult to deal with having 'so many different people' but I never had. The HTT seem fixated on this and to believe that service users think this without even asking them. They may have said something about their being a lot of different faces to which I might have agreed \u2013 service users, when vulnerable, can agree to almost anything that is said so as not to seem 'difficult' or go along with what they think the professionals think they 'should' think. I certainly never found this a problem and don't care about the number of different people I see, just how well they do their job. On this, I feel there is a lot of variation. In my opinion some staff are good, some are not and seem just to want to see the service user is alive, give medication, and leave.\nI was told that I had not been honest with the HTT which felt like discipline for being a 'bad' service user. Actually I had been.\n\nI don't think the HTT realise how difficult it is to tell people about self-harm or suicidal feelings. I was asked if I would disclose this, and told if I couldn't, they would have to look at hospital which I found very coercive, and only results in the service user not disclosing those thoughts and feelings so is counterproductive. How about instead working with the service user so that they feel they can be honest and that decisions will be made with them about their care? I have had staff disclose  my feeling suicidal to other staff, without asking or even telling me. I was terrified of being sectioned and it was a direct result of this unhelpful comment that I did not seek help. Despite this, I did disclose to the HTT that I had self-harmed and nothing was done about this. I asked for another visit that day as this was the first and was refused this. So I think it was unfair to accuse me of not being honest in the first place.\n\nThese staff members told me that since I had attempted suicide shortly before I would have been discharged by the HTT, this 'must' have been the reason, and therefore they would be doing me a 'dis'service! I find this utterly ignorant. Suicidality is very complex and I wasn't going to attempt just to continue to get the HTT's care to which I was indifferent at best. The reasons are a lot mopre complex than that. Really, I assure you, the HTT is not that amazing in my opinion and service users are not that childish.\nI was told the HTT is a short-term service, I know that, I have mental health problems not learning difficulties. That is all I wanted and needed, to get me through the wobbly period after being discharged from hospital. I tried to explain that I needed someone to talk to and the security of someone being there every day, but was told that the CMHT would be enough care (who did not have an appointment for a week), and that I also had psychotherapy (the waiting list is months and I still have not started). This is utterly not the same thing \u2013 I needed a crisis service.\nFinally, the HTT lost my medication which they had when I was under them and which they should have returned to me. They did not, and the hospital insist they did not receive the medication either. When I asked about this I was made to feel like a timewaster and told to go to my GP, but I needed sleeping tablets that night (sleep being very important for my mental health) and the GP had already closed.\nWhat I found to be incompetent and uncaring treatment made the period after leaving hospital so much more difficult. I think that the HTT badly need some training in human compassion and in working with those with mental health issues.", "My daughter has been sick for years. We originally lived in St Albans, and when she fell pregnant she became very ill and blacked out late into her pregnancy, at which point she was admitted to a Mother and Baby unit. Her husband left her, and once discharged from the unit she came to live with us in London.\nShe fell ill again, and was taken to the Maudsley. The second time, she was admitted voluntarily. During the time she was admitted, there was a serious incident for which we instigated a formal complaint.\nShe was discharged and moved to live close to us \u2013 she seemed ok for a while but then her father died so I retired to look after her. She found herself with a new Doctor, and a Psychiatrist from SLAM who changed her meds to an anti-psychotic. This didn't soothe her. I spoke to the CPN about the medication not working but they said I was just fussing. A couple of days later, my daughter set fire to her own hair. \nI stayed with her for a week but she was very unwell and soon after the Out of Hours Doctor sent her to Ruskin Ward at Guys Hospital. I had an operation myself and was really worried about who would care for my daughter as I recovered. We were promised community care but the day after I was admitted to hospital, her brother went to visit her and found her slumped over the table, she had overdosed. \nShe was rushed to Kings Hospital, who then moved her back to the Maudsley and eventually back to Ruskin Ward. As you can imagine, considering the earlier incident, we didn't feel this was appropriate at all but there seemed no choice. \nShe was discharged home, and her CPN saw her on the Friday but didn't actually do anything as far as I am aware. On the Sunday, they rung me to say she \u2018wasn't well' and I was worried. I went round to see her and called an ambulance. She had set fire to papers in her flat the police had arrived but she wouldn't open the door. She was rushed to Kings and put on oxygen, and then moved back to Guys. The police charged her and made her go to court. \nI don't feel the high response housing team have really done anything to help my daughter or I. They found her a home, but she was so unhappy there. There were two men there and my daughter did not get on with them, it didn't help her. She also only had one meal a day. \nShe was moved to the Ladywell Unit in Lewisham, but she tried to kill herself and no one told me and they moved her back to the Maudsley.

I was previously known to the services. I was taken in after a serious suicide attempt. During my stay I made further suicide attempts where I needed the staff to use an oxygen lead in the room. After 24 hrs another shift was on and realised the oxygen lead was missing. They calculated I had it on me. The staff nurse took me into a side room and asked for the lead. After I refused to return it, the staff nurse said it was serious for them and if I killed myself they would lose their jobs. I still refused to hand it over. They left me but after I settled for bed the staff woke me and restrained me so they could retrieve the oxygen lead.\n\nFollowing the restraint I needed medication which I had in an injection. I later went to the bathroom where I had been injected and the needle was left in there and had been there several hours with the bathroom accessible to all patients. I later self harmed with the needle. I was discharged on the Monday as I was causing serious difficulties. I was discharged when I was still ill and went straight out and took an overdose. To my knowledge of the situation, the doctor had stated on file that I could not be re-sectioned so the police who wanted to put me on an emergency section were unable as I had been given permission to kill myself. Obiously for me this was a very concerning experience I was placed in hospital for my own safety but evidence shows I was not kept safe. I feel it was lucky I found the needle that had been used on me because it could have put a lot of patients at risk.\n\nRegarding the oxygen lead, in my view staff only cared for their jobs and not to be found out to the point that they restrained me to protect themselves. To be released early not only put me at danger but my partner who also has mental health issues was powerless and he was very concerned. I believe these incidents are very serious and staff should be more alert with serious equipment. If you are place in a place of safety, you expect this sort of thing not to happen. I never complained as I felt I wouldn't be listened to.\n\n \n\n", "\r\n\r\nThe Trust takes patient safety very seriously and the staff on the ward are encouraged and supported to report incidents such as \u201cleads going missing\u201d to reduce the risks to patients and to maintain safety on the ward.

NHS 24 sent me to hospital three times, where I would get painkillers. The first time I was seen by an incredibly loving doctor who really took care of me and alleviate the pain. The third time I went to hospital after hours in pain and vomiting I was told I might have migraines.\nI went to check this with my GP, who gave me a treatment that worked only for a while. My migraines were being really disruptive and I ended up having a depression. When I went to my GP to check this, he told me to fill out a questionnaire and to come back. He didn't let me speak or explain what I was feeling, he heard \"depression\" and he produced the questionnaire straight away, then he told me he couldn't give any more time to deal with my migraine pain as I didn't have a double appointment and we had already gone through an issue.\nWhen I came back, again, without listening to me, he checked the questionnaire and he said I had a severe depression, and that was the reason for my migraines. I said that I thought it was the other way around. I could easily be in pain 7 days in a row, which made me really sad. I have no family here, NHS was the only thing I could use to feel better. He insisted that my depression was causing the miraines and gave me antidepressants but they didn't work. Then he sent me home with no advice at all about any kind of counselling services or anything.\nAfter another bad experience when dealing with swine flu (I was called liar by another doctor, but that's another story) I decided to change surgery. In the new surgery the doctor gave me a new treatment for the migraines, and I really appreciated that he had time to listen to the symptoms. After a while the treatment stopped working and I was given new pills to try. This new trial and error went on for more than a year, and after so many pills I ended up with a very delicate stomach.\n\nOne day last summer I had to go to the surgery again after a night with severe stomach pain, I thought it was an ulcer. NHS 24 advised me to have some Paracetamol, which didn't work. In the surgery they gave me Omeprazole, but the pain continued. It happened that the next day I went away to my home country, where I decided to see my doctor. She diagnosed a gall bladder full of stones after feeling my tummy, and after an ultrasound she saw that the gallbladder was nearly bursting. I had to have an emergency surgery. Now, I wonder what it would have happened if I had stayed in Edinburgh. I know I sound bitter but being given paracetamol and omeprazole after a night of horrible pain feels a bit like a joke, I felt really left alone by the health system, which was worsened after my first experience at the first surgery.\n\nGoing back to my migraines, after more than two years having them and being really disruptive, I asked to see a neurologist. At this time I was starting to lose my hair and to have memory loss. My doctor said, really lightly, that some tumours manifest that way and he made me touch the tip of my nose tith my index finger and some other exercices, after which he discarded the tumour (is that how a tumour is diagnosed? really?). He changed the medication again and refused for me to see a neurologist. Now, how would anyone feel at this stage? With two misdiagnoses already (the severe depression and the gall bladder) and the suggestion of a tumour, with almost daily pain and a lot of questions about migraines that hadn't improved in two years, what was I supposed to feel?\n\nOne night I had another really sever migraine crisis and I went to hospital again, where the doctor said they couldn't give me anything for the pain as I had reached the maximum amount of opiates I could have. The doctor was really kind but unfortunately she couldn't help me and suggested for me to talk (again) with my gp to change (again) the treatment. I was sent home vomiting and in pain.\n\nWhen I tried to book an appointment with my GP, I was told that he had left the surgery. My new doctor is really caring and she understands how difficult is to deal with the pain almost daily. Her new tratment worked well and it's working so far, I'm really grateful.\n\nWhen I thought my bad luck with NHS had reached an end, I started being bitten by some kind of insect. One of the bites made my left hand really swollen, to the point I couldn't make a fist. \nIn my surgery I can only get appointments if I ask one week in advance, the alternative are emergency appointments. My hand wasn't an emergency so far. \n\nAs NHS Scotland doesn't appear to offer any kind of walk-in centres, I found a walk-in pharmacy service (there is only one in Edinburgh) where I was given antibiotics and I was advised to see my doctor. My hand got better and since by the time I would see my doctor a week would have passed, I thought it would be a waste of time for my surgery.\nI was bitten by an insect again a couple of days ago (on a Friday), this time in my arm. My arm was extremelly swollen and red, and the swelling was extended to my forearm and my elbow. It looked really bad and it was very painful. As I couldn't see my doctor until Monday, NHS 24 sent me to the Royal Infirmary. The doctor there wasn't very reassuring. Her words were \"Oh, that's odd!\" when she saw my arm. Then she asked me for the previous treatment and she resolved to give me more antibiotics. I asked if I could maybe get some strong antihistamins (I was having some that the pharmacy had given me without results) and she said there wasn't anything stronger. She then advised me to see my doctor, as she didn't know what could be happening to me.\n\nI apologize if this looks biaised and emotional, but, really, is \"Oh, that's odd\" reassuring at all when you have a swollen arm and you are in pain? Is it normal that a doctor can't make a diagnosis? Or to be given antidepressants in what I feel is a random way? I used to be healthier than now. My migraines have improved a bit, but my stomach is really sensitive. I think this is due to the large amount of pills taken and I'm resistant to painkillers. Everytime I'm sick I get worried, as I can't see my doctor unless things are really bad, which translates into days of pain and discomfort. In case of an emergency, the hospital can't give me painkillers or a proper diagnosis. I was told lightly that some of my symptoms were caused by a tumour. I don't think this is a humane and caring approach. \nI am realy grateful to my current doctor and to the lovely doctor who saw me when I got first sick, they make me feel that some people really care about patients. I can't say anything positive about anything else, especially regarding my gallbladder. It's really hard to feel helpless when you are sick or in pain, I feel there's nowhere for me to go.", "I am sorry that you appear to have had poor experiences with the NHS.\r\nI can't comment on your specific experiences as I don't know your name.\r\nIf you would like us to look into your experiences and give a full explanation and reply please contact us as below\r\nWrite - NHS Lothian Complaints Team.

Our nightmare started just over a week later. He was in a lot of pain but we had been told to expect this from the hospital, we realised he had lost some weight and when I asked him about it he said he felt sick when he thought of food - this from someone that could have eaten a horse had you put salt and pepper on it.The following day we picked him up from his flat that he shared with his girlfriend, he looked terrible. He sat down and he really was moaning with pain. I told him I was ringing the GP who arrived 20 minutes later. He looked at my son and told me he was sending him to hospital. He gave me a note which stated that my son had a blood clot and he rang the ambulance which arrived about 30 minutes later.It took the paramedics 15 minutes to get him into the ambulance as he was in so much pain, we had gone about 5 min and the paramedic in the back with us told the driver to put the blue lights on. I noticed my son's arm had gone limp and he was being worked on - the driver was told to get us there as quickly as poss and to have the resus team ready. I was in a state of sheer panic by this time. They got my son round and he turned around and said \u2018Mam I thought I had died'. He was crying and so was I. We eventually got to Wansbeck where my son was taken into resus. I was allowed in after 15 minutes. My son still looked ill but the colour had returned to his face. He told me to stop crying. I was told they had given him morphine and had done a couple of tests. About an hour later a Consultant came to seem my son, he told me my son was a fit young lad and he was not worried about him. I replied that I was very worried. I asked what they were going to do, he told me they were going to top my son's pain relief up and send him home in a couple of hours. I was mortified and told him I did not agree with that and that my son had vomited blood and could not eat properly. He relented and they kept him in over night. He was put on a ward and his girlfriend and I went with him. He was really hot and asked his girlfriend to take his jogging pants off but to be careful as his legs were very sore. We mentioned this to a nurse but she just said ok. When we were leaving my son was becoming agitated again and I was worried he may stop breathing like he had in the ambulance. I stood 15 minutes trying to get the attention of the nurses who I overheard discussing their social life. I told them I was worried and they said they would see to him. I wasn't convinced so I rang my son when I got home, he said he was tired because they had given him codeine so I wished him goodnight.The following day I rang my son in the morning. He said he was still tired. I told him I would see him later, and I rung the ward and asked how he had been. They told me he had had a comfortable night. I visited my son in the afternoon, his girlfriend was already there and was told they were discharging him. I wasn't happy about this and expressed my opinion to the Dr who replied by saying that I could probably look after him better at home. I was gobsmacked. Anyway we came home but he vomited nearly all the way home. I said I would take him back in to Wansbeck. He replied by telling me I should stop being obsessive and that they had told him there was nothing wrong with him. He still could not eat properly and remained ill but had picked up slightly. At the beginning of December we had an appt with the doctor who told my son he was not going to examine him because \u2018he didn't look well'. His weight had been taken on the back in November before this appointment and he had been 12 stone 7. On this day, only 2-3 weeks on, he was 10 stone 2. We came out of the hospital and I made an appt at our GPs where he was given antibiotics.The following day my son rang and asked me to make him steak, chips and onions for his dinner. I was over the moon at last he was eating. We went out Christmas shopping and had a lovely day, his girlfriend rang that night to say he had never stopped eating, I was so pleased and went to bed happy for the first time in days.Two days later, my son rang to say he had a sore leg so me and his dad went round. I told him I would ring the Dr but he told me not to, he said he was going to have a bath and see if it helped. As we left the flat he was lying in the bath we were all laughing. He told us he would see us later and that he loved us, we shouted back that we loved him too. It was the last time we saw our beloved son alive, he died just after 3 o'clock. We couldn't believe our normally 6ft 5ins fit and healthy son had gone. A police guard was put on his body in the morgue plus someone from Hexham hospital. No one could go and see him unless they were on a list. All his files were seized from Wansbeck.A post mortem showed that the blood clot had been dated to that first incident where he was taken in by ambulance. No one would sign a death certificate which we assumed was because mistakes had been made. A senior police officer came to see us and said that he normally dealt with murders or manslaughter cases but had been told to do ours. There were two postmortems, both were the same and dated the blood clot at the same date as the first. We had a meeting with the CEO, but all we got out of him was a sorry. An independent investigation was done which highlighted 18 mistakes had been made because the police seized all the paper work - it was all down in black and white.We had the inquest in early 2011, a [narrative verdict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_verdict) was given. When asked about the abnormal ECG we were told it was probably because my son was tall and thin, but that the machine did not work properly anyway. Another Dr, who discharged my son without reading his notes or seeing him and sent him home with a news score of 4.5 (which is critical) was asked what role was his at Wansbeck, he replied he didn't know. It was a catalogue of errors which cost my son his life.When a Dr was asked why the pathway wasn't followed he argued it was, he was then asked if that was the case why did my son not have the CT scan. After 5 minutes of arguing he said that my son wasn't given the scan because he could have got cancer in later life. An expert witness Dr said that my son could have been saved if they had given him the scan.To my understanding, the Consultant had overruled the GP's letter, an xray showing a patch on my son's lung which was marked by the radiologist, a raised D.Dimer reading and a junior Dr saying he thought it was a blood clot. This was the same member of staff that flippantly told me \"Your son is a young fit lad and I am not worried about him\u201d.", "I am sorry that this experience with us was unsatisfactory and I thank the service user for taking the time to share their views. \r\nDerbyshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust values all feedback and uses it to improve quality and we are always concerned to hear when a service user has had a negative experience and would be keen to hear directly from the individual or their representative. \r\nIt is not possible or appropriate to enter into a public discussion via this forum, but would encourage the service user, or anyone with an issue, to contact our Patient Experience Department.

Within 48 hours I saw another doctor who said my abscess was so bad that antibiotics were now too late and said I needed to go straight to Hospital or I would probably die.  \r\nI was in Hospital for days and had to have surgery where they had to drain huge amounts of the poison.

He is fit and active, rides a motorcycle and snow boards.  He knew it was something more serious than a sprain.  On being examined and asked on a scale of 1-10 how painful it was he said 9.  He was sent home with painkillers.  He suffered for 2 weeks, continuing to work and in constant agony.  When he could bear it no longer he visited Chard minor injuries unit.  \r\n\r\nNurse Debbie at Chard Minor Injuries Unit did the simplest of routine test and diagnosed a broken Achilles Tendon.  She was on the phone to a consultant in Yeovil straight away and was recommending surgery immediately.  The following day he saw a consultant, was scanned and it was discovered that 98% of his tendon was unattached!  No wonder he was in pain.  No one could believe he had not been back sooner!  No two people's pain threshold is the same. He was operated on the next day and the surgeon did a beautiful job.

My wait was approximately 20 mins, as they were chatting as well. \n\nWhile I was there, I was told by one member of staff to 'stop putting my illness on' and get on with my life, because my fianc\u00e9 would leave me.

She had self referred to mental health team some days prior to this event as she was very afraid of how she felt and was refused an interview by the psychiatrist on duty. \nI am a carer for a person with long term mental and physical health problems but do some caring of this nature too. Her husband/carer has been unsupported for decades. He works away to pay bills leaving his wife alone, afraid and unwell. \nI am of the opinion this is a crutch as they are unsupported and the mental health team are proving ineffective in her case. \nThe hospital discharged this person after taking a large amount of analgesics within 24 hours and put her in a taxi and sent her home alone. No service seemed to see the necessity to engage with her. Her discharge letter was given in her hand to notify her GP which she could not do as had just been so ill. \nI took the discharge letter to her GP, the receptionist informed me that even though this person was on her own and suicidal, the GP had a weekly meeting until 3pm and nothing could be done to change that. No other GP was available. After some diplomacy and debate about priorities and meetings before suicidal patients it was agreed the receptionist would enter the GP meeting to discuss. I did not want to leave this person alone when suicidal but had to leave. \nI was contacted on my journey home roughly one hour later by a different receptionist on my mobile who to me sounded aggressive. I was being told I would have to contact the mental health services, I refused and reiterated I was asking the GP to go out to see the lady. \nHer CPN that same morning had refused to come to the house unable to grasp the difficulties she would have with leaving the house. I could only assume this person was instructed to not to give a home visit, or perhaps there was a shortage of staff? \nThe CPN offered a meeting the following day in a public place which I think was a poor professional decision as the woman was in a dangerous state of mind and in great jeopardy of taking action to end her own life.  I do believe the mental health team are pressured and short staffed and that this CPN may have been told to do this.  The patient then felt abandoned once again by the mental health team. I am limited in what I can reveal as she has not consented to awareness being raised, consequently I can only expose certain failings.\nWithin another day the police had to be called and she was found in a dangerous position, posing serious risk to herself. She was assessed and told by the duty psychiatrist she warranted help but there were no beds in Cornwall.\nThe mental health services in Cornwall seem seriously inadequate to me. Ironically this person has been helping in the community as a service user to raise this issue and has worked hard to improve things. It's my impression that the serious and gravely ill people are not being treated adequately.\nI await with baited breath as I know she is unable to have good insight to what is happening and may still attempt to take her life although she is getting some treatment now. None of it from my perspective has been effective and I question how much longer before we may lose her and she goes in the stats as another case being investigated. \n", "In 2012 I was detained under section 2 of mental health act for about 60 hours within a Coventry located Hospital.  Over the week prior to admission I was informed by my usual treating Consultant Psychiatrist (since 2007) I was experiencing hypomanic symptoms.  My treating consultant took 2 weeks annual leave immediately prior to my compulsory period of hospitalisation.  \n\nMy recollection of early stages of hospitalisation period is limited and derived from information provided to me by my relatives.  Paramedics escorted me via ambulance to the Clinical Decisions Unit University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire in the early hours on Saturday morning.   I was subject to mental health act assessment during inpatient stay on the unit as my blood level concentration of psychotropic medication was elevated.  My psychiatric history includes bipolar affective disorder, PTSD & severe generalised anxiety disorder for which I am prescribed regular psychotropic medication - anticonvulsant, antidepressant, antipsychotic, beta blockers.  Post mental health assessment I was transferred directly to Spencer Ward at Caludon Centre Coventry (General Adult Psychiatry Female Inpatients).   \n\nIt is of concern to me that for the total duration of my inpatient hospitalisation period I received None of medication my GP regularly prescribes to me for my physical health conditions - this includes failure to prescribe me antihypertensives, beta blockers, HRT, IBS symptomatic therapy.   It is well documented in medical text that abrupt ceasation of beta blockers leads to  condition of rebound hypertension - rebound rise in blood pressure.  It is well documented in medical text that abrupt ceasation of HRT in vulnerable patients predisposes to increased agitiation and mood fluctuation \n\nIt is of concern to me that the clinical staff declined to prescribe me the aforementioned physical health medication despite me instructing them in writing the names and dosage of each medication.   This information is relatively easy for me to recall as I have a medical background.  It was also provided to them via my partner who is trained medical practitioner.  I told them I am regularly prescribed aforementioned physical health medication by my GP so experience adverse health consequences if it is rapidly withdrawn and stopped.  Shortly prior to my discharge from Caludon Centre a junior grade psychiatrist on call requested medical advice from physicans at University Hospital regards my significantly heightened blood pressure and prescribed me single dose of amlodipine.  I did not receive clinical interview or physical examination by the admission psychiatric doctor when admitted to mental health unit.\n\nI am instructed the psychiatric clinical team were unable to prescribe me necessary medication for physical health conditions according to my partner.  My relatives were told on direct enquiry by clinical nursing staff working on spencer ward that \n1. My psychiatric (caludon centre) patient case notes were not available as not able be found.\n2.My University Hospital patient case notes could not be transferred to mental health unit over weekend \n2. My GP was not contactable as it was weekend\n3. I did not have prescription from GP documenting prescribed medication with me on admission to mental health unit hospital.\n\nAt discharge I was interviewed briefly via Consultant Psychiatrist whom I had not met before.  I was asked if I wanted to go home and replied yes I did - by this time I felt physically unwell with palpitations, blurred then double vision and headache.   I was not given at discharge any medication or paper work documentation to take to my GP.  Immediately on leaving hospital I went to my GP for support\n\n** My treating Consultant Psychiatrist was on annual leave during total period of my admission - I consider in his absence I received severely compromised and dysfunctional standard of clinical care from treating clinical staff.   \n\nI submit this story in the hope that other patients (and relatives of patients) forcibly detained in mental health unit under section of mental health act for treatment of mental health condition may appreciate the potential difficulties encountered to their existent physical as opposed to mental health.  I found myself in what I felt to be degrading and severely compromising circumstances in which my physical health was deteriorating.  I was physically trapped within  the \"therapeutic environment\" of mental health unit unable to access my habitual GP prescribed medication - I wrote repeatedly to clinical staff over weekend period to access medication with no success!!\n\nI believe my physical health would have been better provided for if my regular treating Consultant Psychiatrist had been available.  In my view the Caludon Centre needs to make better provision for treatment of patients by oncall clinical staff during out of hours period - without this improvement in its clinical service provision patient/s might in my view be subject to serious medical complications.", "We are really concerned for our Mum, who has been under the care of The Somerset Mental Health Team for the past two years suffering with Depression and maybe a Personality Disorder.  She feels, at times, very suicidal and has tried on many occasions to end her life and it affects us tremendously but we feel she gets treated unfairly because nobody knows how to help her in times of distress, so it's always the Police who land the job of looking out to her, by placing her in a cell, like a criminal.\n\nWe feel this has been going on and on and that's the way she's dealt with, no follow-up when they let her go the next day until the next time it happens.  The Police are really good with her but it's not the way to go on - we don't know what to do, in our view nobody listens to her.. or to us, nothing gets done.", "I am glad that you are now getting the help you require but I am sorry that you have had to appeal for the intervention of a senior manager. We hope that our services can be accessed without such actions. It might still be worth sharing your experience with Martyn - so that we can take some learning and try to avoid this situation in future.\r\n\r\nBest wishes. ", "I was admitted to hospital after visiting my doctor who confirmed that my blood pressure had risen dramatically and protein was visible in my waters. My fianc\u00e9 and I then made our way to the hospital where I was admitted after the midwife on duty confirmed I had +4 protein in my waters and my blood pressure had risen to 178 over 122. I was then confirmed that I had pre-eclampsia and I had to be closely monitored and was told that I wouldn't be discharged until my baby was born.\nDuring my stay I must stress I received exceptional care from the midwives' and nursing team, however the reason for this complaint is due to the care from my consultant and my consultant's team.\nOn numerous occasions the midwives called on my consultant as they were concerned about my health as it was deteriorating dramatically. (I was completely swollen from head to toe with water retention to the point I could barely move, tightening in the chest, headaches and dizziness). \nThe consultant or one of the doctors came and saw me and asked if I was a smoker which I confirmed I was not, and said that the tightening of the chest was due to a cold. Every time I mentioned to the midwives how bad I was feeling they called on my consultant who kept telling me it was a cold I had and the tightening of the chest was not pre-eclampsia.\nI was 35 weeks pregnant and I was also told that they wanted to keep me pregnant until I became 36 weeks as they were concerned that my baby would need to go into special care if I was to have her before 36 weeks and also told me that there was no more room in special care for babies at that time. (I felt they were not interested in me and my health.) A few days later, in the early hours, I broke down to one of the midwives as I became quite scared as I was struggling to breath, I knew something was not right.\nThat morning the midwife on duty called on my consultant and one of the team came and visited me again, and again said they felt the tightening of the chest was a cold. (I did not have a cold!) and again they stressed to me that they needed me to go to 36 weeks before they did anything. During that day I got worse and worse to the point my fianc\u00e9 complained and said that something was seriously wrong and something needed to be done. The decision was then made that they were going to transfer me to QEQM, Margate hospital, it was then decided not to due to my physical health.\nDuring this time there was a changeover of midwives and this particular midwife came to see me and was shocked that I had just been left. She said that she would get me dealt with as she was extremely concerned. (Unfortunately I did not manage to catch her name but if you could find out who she was, please send my thanks).\nWithin 5 minutes, I had 5 members of staff assist me; I was put on 100% oxygen and moved straight down to labour ward. My stats were down to 84 and the staff were concerned for both myself and my baby. I was then told that I was going to be put out while they did the emergency c-section. However as I was being prepared for this and signed the necessary paperwork, the anethesist came to see me and was concerned, due to the lack of oxygen in my blood, I may not make it by being put completely out. The decision was then made to give me a spinal block.\nThe staff that were dealing with me at the time were prompt and professional. After I had had my baby, early hours of the next day. My original consultant and a colleauge came to see me and they tried to justify the reasons why they did not act. (As you can appreciate I was less than impressed and was not interested in what they had to say).\nI was later moved back up to the ward where the midwives were very supportive after what I had been through. I was then told my health was not stable and I was unable to go home. Again the decision of this was left down to the consultant and team. After the neglect I was giving by that team, the last person I wanted to deal with was them. I was eventually discharged the week after.\nSince I have been home, I have struggled emotionally and still find my whole experience very distressing. There was a case on the news in January where a mother gave birth to a baby boy and later died. I know how much my life was at risk and it sickens me that my daughter could have grown up without her mother.\nThe whole experience has affected me in a number of ways and I feel this is down to the way I was just dismissed as if I was just a little girl that didn't know what she was talking about. I also feel if I was older and married I would have been treated with a bit more respect which I find absolutely disgusting.", "Dear relative\nThank you for taking the time to share your experience of Somerset Partnership services on this website.\nThe Trust is very sorry to hear of the difficulties and distress that you have all experienced as a family trying to cope with your mum.\nWe would welcome the opportunity to discuss further your concerns, and if you would like to contact the Patient Advice and Liaison Service, PALS, I will be pleased to see how I can help you.\nMy contact details are:\nKaren Howard-Grenville\nPatient Advice and Liaison Specialist\nTel No: 01278 432022", "We are sorry that the NHS overall didn't live up to your expectations.

Within 5 days she contracted hospital acquired pneumonia. This was treated. They then suspected she had a stroke. They tried to discharge her from the stroke unit. She was unable to walk and barely conscious. We objected strenously and they capitulated. That afternoon she was moved into the medical ward and it was discovered she had a severe chest infection which had returned. The current position is that she is delerious and unable to communicate due to delerium from the infection. They are treating with iv antibiotics. \n\nI have been appalled at the way my mother has been treated, along with medical judgement being seriously lacking as far as I can understand, basic common sense does not seem to have been applied. \n\nIf my mother survives this experience, and I have my doubts about that, I am concerned that other vulnerable elderly patients will be treated like this. The only reason my mother was not discharged in that perilous condition was because she has some very strong advocates in the form of her family.\n\nI believe basic nursing care is lacking. Waiting 2 hours to be taken to the toilet, refusing decent pain relief, trying to discharge a dangerously ill patient, poor hygiene in the parts of the hospital that my mother has been treated in resulting in pneumonia. The food so unappealing that my mother refused to touch it because she was frightened it would make her ill. When so ill she was unable to eat on her own, no help was offered. \nFrom my mother's experience, I believe there is a lack of communication from hospital staff, we have often been unable to speak to the doctor, we have had doctors failing to return calls when our family have expressed concern. I also believe my mother suffered discrimination due to her age. Her hearing aid was broken (by a member of staff) but it was not repaired, I have observed staff failing to recognise my mother's deafness and not ensuring that communicaion was enabled. I could go on.\n\n", "In November 2011 my leg gave way and I had a fall, breaking my knee-cap and tearing my tendon.  I was taken by ambulance to Musgrove where I had tests and x-rays, my leg was put in plaster before having an operation the following day.  \nI was moved to Gould ward where I stayed for the next 2 weeks.  \nThe ambulance crew staff at A&E and my time in Gould Ward was excellent.  It was a different matter when I was brought home.  \nI was told I would be taken home to see how I could cope!  I felt like I was just dumped. I had no food as no-one knew I was coming home. I was told I would have a care package and from that day to this, no one has been anywhere near me. I'm still on crutches and have limited flexibly and can't use bath, shower, oven etc.  I have been able to get seated ambulances to take me to and from hospital visits.  I have arranged this myself. I have found the people who arrange this very helpful. \nI am elderly, live alone and have type 2 Diabetes.  My neighbour has been kind enough to help with shopping etc. I am having physiotherapy and have arranged transport to get there and home. There is a lot of talk via TV of people being sent home after hospitalisation and being looked after at home.  This is a new initiative which seems to be about saving hospital beds being blocked. I think this is a bad idea as I can see people dying if left alone.\n\n", "I am sorry to hear that your friend's experience was poor.

We dread our residents going to hospital but sometimes it is inevitable.\nOne of our residents recently spent a week in hospital (actually it was 2 hospitals both part of the same trust).  This resident is in his 80s and frail but had been doing really well in the home, eating and drinking well, happy and contented, free of pressure sores and his skin in good condition despite severe psoriasis.   This resident has a catheter and got an infection that was quite bad, he also has a kidney tumour exasperating the problem.   So he went to hospital for the infection to be treated.  He responded well to treatment within a day or so and we asked for him to come home as we are quite able to care for him with support from District nurses (who, by the way, are wonderful).   It took another week to get him home during which time he was transferred to another hospital.\nWhen he finally came home he was in a very poor state - dehydrated, emaciated and with a bed sore.  His psoriasis was also terrible.\nNo one had helped him to eat or drink, although the family and us had stated he needs help.   No preventative measures had been employed to avoid bed sores and no one had applied cream to his hands or legs for his psoriasis.   He has begged us not to let him go through that again. Sadly the damage is done and he is now so weak and frail that he is on end of life care. I feel like hospitals can be very good a pumping people full of medication but seem to ignore the fact that without the basics of human life e.g. food and drink they will only deteriorate.\nWe love our residents and take great care of them and feel so angry and upset when others show no care or respect.  The excuse is that nurses don't have time to feed people or help them drink - why not?  These should be the basics with everything else secondary.    \n\nSadly this is not an isolated incident as we have other similar stories  and not just from one hospital but 3 in our locality.\nIt is about time the common sense and compassion was put back into our hospitals to stop people suffering and dying needlessly from pure neglect.", "My son was born in this hospital 2 years ago; I have just discovered this website and felt I had to tell my story.\nA week after my son was due my waters broke, I went to the delivery suite and was examined by a midwife, she said my waters had broken and I would be induced within 48 hours to prevent infection to me and the baby. She left the room and came back, said the head midwife didn't think my waters had broke and to go home and come back on my planned day of induction if I still didn't go into labour naturally, I never saw the head midwife she didn't even come into the room I was in.\nFor a week I had regular contractions and dilated 3 cms, I was made to go in every day for a heart trace of the baby, every time they said I had a sleepy baby as his heart rate kept slowing, a consultant was called each time and said trace looks fine send her home. I would then hear the midwives  whispering that they didn't think the trace looked good.\n\n On planned day of induction I was told there was no bed for me on the delivery suite, was taken to delivery next morning. The midwife I was given tried to break my waters, I told her they had all ready broke but she tried anyway, said oh there is no waters there!\nI ended up having an emergency section, during the op the Anaesthetist was arguing with the some of the midwives telling them to shut up, they were also arguing in recovery.\nThe next morning I was on maternity ward, told to get up and go in shower, I was in agony and was shouted at by a midwife for been in so much pain as apparently she had a section and wasn't in pain like I was. I was walked to shower then left. I couldn't bend down to take surgical stockings off so had to call for help, was huffed and puffed at then left again\nI was allowed home the next day, a week later after I'd had the staples removed I felt really unwell, I was shaking and my teeth were chattering, my husband said there was an awful smell and liquid was seeping out of my section wound\nI was told to go to A&E. The staff on A&E were lovely. A Gynaecologist came to see me, she was also lovely, she touched my wound and it exploded. What seemed like litres and litres of puss went all over her, up the walls and on the floor, she said my abdomen had burst\nI was taken back to maternity ward with my son and given 3 bags of blood and intravenous antibiotics. The next day 3 consultants and 2 junior doctors came to see me, they didn't introduce themselves or say what they were going to do. A midwife was told to get forceps, and they whispered amongst themselves, a midwife was told to lift my stomach up (bit over overhang off pregnancy belly ) a junior doctor proceeded to rip open the part of my wound that had healed, I was offered no pain relief or told what they were doing, I was in absolute agony and screaming at them to stop touching me, they then all left the room\nA few hours later a midwife and a auxiliary arrived and told me they needed to get the fluid out of me, this meant the midwife putting both of her hands on my abdomen and pushing as hard as she could, again this was extremely painful and I was crying out and asking her to stop, she didn't, at this point my husband walked in and asked them what the hell they thought they were doing, she walked out with her head down. He went down to the staff room to ask what was going on but nobody seemed to know\nAfter this my husband wouldn't leave me and slept in the private room on a chair for a week, another consultant came to see me, said my wound had broken down and you could see my rectal sheath, he said my wound would have to heal from the inside out then it would have to be sown up again, a lovely midwife arranged for me to have a bottle of gas and air brought to me, I used this the 2 times a day the wound was cleaned and packed\nA week later the consultant came back and said he would \"fix \" me\nI was taken into theatre and my wound was cleaned and repaired, I was in theatre for 4 hours\nit was the worst experience of my life, the way I was treated was an utter disgrace.\n", "I have been in and out of this Hospital in four years.

The Caludon Centre is a mental health hospital located in Coventry West Midlands managed by the Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership Trust.  I am prescribed psychotropic medication for bipolar affective disorder, post traumatic stress disorder and severe chronic anxiety related condition.   \n\nPrior to the easter period 2012 my treating consultant psychiatrist instructed me I was relapsing regards my mental health and developing hypomanic condition.  They told me I must take my prescribed psychotropic medication compliantly as prescribed or I might find myself admitted to Caludon Centre for inpatient therapy.   As they were to take 2 weeks annual leave over easter period they asked psychiatric colleagues to assess / monitor my mental health within the community setting during their annual leave to ensure I remained safe.  I have good therapeutic relationship usually with my treating Consultant Psychiatrist.  \n\nThus 4 members of Caludon Centre psychiatric staff visited me at home - 2 doctors and 2 social workers - I declined to speak with psychiatric staff fearful I might be hospitalised again compulsorily detained under section of mental health act.   \n\nThe psychiatric team in my absence (after I had driven off away from my residential address) had instructed local police force to locate me due to their ongoing concern about stability of my mental health.  Consequently shortly after I returned home and had gone to bed the police officers attended my residential address and as I did not answer front door forced entry into my home.  Police found me drowsy in bed. I live alone.  I had taken additional tablets, extra tablets from my usual prescribed psychotropic medication in an attempt to get to sleep together with some alcohol.   The police officers arranged for me to be immediately transferred via ambulance to Accident and Emergency unit at University Hospital Coventry for further medical physical and mental health assessment.   Later the same day a formal mental health act assessment resulted in my compulsory hospitalisation for further assessment within the Caludon Centre detained under section 2 of the mental health act.    I remained hospitalised within Caludon Centre for less then 48 hours after which I was discharged - I was told to find my own way home where I would stay alone as I live on my own.\n\nSeveral aspects of this admission concern me.  I consider that the treating psychiatric staff could have managed my clinical case better.\n\n1.  I was hospitalised detained under section 2 of mental health act for less then 48 hours.  This is the second occassion this has occurred to me whilst I have mental health service user with Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership Trust.  \n**** A detention under section of the mental health act should not be considered a trivial event as it has statuatory implications for patient concerned including that they are compulsorily hospitalised hence have limitations placed on their personal rights and freedom.   Such a detention under mental health act section remains on my medical record for rest of my life and can have adverse employment or alternative social consequences.   Information about sectioning procedure and detention will be included on my Criminal Records Bureau Disclosure under relevant information section should I request an enhanced CRB disclosure in future to gain voluntary or paid employment.  \n\nOR\nb) I did not need to be detained in hospital at all under section 2 of mental health act - in short the psychiatric team detained me in hospital to avoid making a more detailed comprehensive risk assessment of risk I posed to myself or others - the psychiatric team were not qualified or experienced enough to make such a risk assessment or did not deem it relevant to do so for whatever reason.   I add here that the week immediately post discharge from Caludon Centre was extremely chaotic for me.   I found all of these visits traumatic and embarassing as my neighbours witnessed emergency services repeatedly visiting my residential address for no obvious reason.  I now have to live in my community knowing that most of my neighbourhood know I am mentally deranged at times and this irritates me to extent I prefer to avoid direct contact with them.\n\n2. My next of kin - mother - was not told by mental health team that I was to be discharged from inpatient mental health hospital care on day of discharge - hence it was a surprise to my next of kin to learn of my early discharge from hospital -in practical terms she did not have opportunity to make sure I arrived home safely on day of discharge via phoning me when I got home.\n\n3.  I was discharged without any discharge medication to take when got home or recommendations about what medication to take.  \n\n4. I was discharged without any discharge paperwork to take to my GP to recognise I had been admitted to Caludon Centre.   My GP was not made aware by psychiatric team / hospital staff that I was mentally unwell and had been admitted to mental health hospital.  Hence  my GP was not in a position to arrange to provide additonal support to me post discharge from mental health hospital.  I have very good GP who is supportive if made aware of situation patients find themselves in.  \n\n5. I was not given any written or verbal instructions regards follow up aftercare arrangements I should use post discharge to my recollection.  \n\n At discharge I knew my treating consultant psychiatrist would return from annual leave 12 days later and that I might speak with them then - otherwise I was not given any formal structured follow up plan to follow if I needed support regards my mental health.  ****I receive support from local CMHT community mental health team however one of my support workers was also taking same 2 weeks annual leave easter break as my treating consultant and remainder of CMHT team were less easy to acccess due to easter bank holiday breaks.  ****I receive additional support from a voluntary council funded charity however my usual healthcare support worker is off work due to longterm ill health issues and I had not met my new replacement worker before so did not feel inclined to attend charity facility for support if I was extremely distressed - I find it relatively difficult to trust and relate to new staff initially until I get to know them abit.\n\n6.I was discharged without access to money that was suitable for use on local public transport that I could use to get home.   I was admitted to hospital from home without any personal possessions (no mobile phone, shoes, change of clothes etc.\n\n \nAs a mental health service user with a longstanding history of mental ill health I question the purpose of brief admissions to mental health hospitals under sections of mental health act - compulsory detention in hospital against patients wishes or desire is traumatic and I found it stigmatising, degrading, and felt like a criminal - effectively punished for being in less then in perfect health - instructed in reality I was not able to make my own decisions or judgements as I was mentally unsound.\n\nIt would be advantangeous to me and probably other mental health users if mental health service providers placed more emphasis and gave more consideration to \na) purpose and desired therapeutic outcome of brief periods of detention for patients compulsorily hospitalised under mental health act sections - patients that do not want to be in hospital are less likely to comply with mental health teams proposed therapeutic regimes and may become anti - psychiatric in attitude if patient believes they have no human rights and are compelled to comply with mental health teams recommendations unquestionably\nb) therapeutic plan for period post discharge from hospital as if patient is only hospitalised for brief perid their condition is likely to be similar to that present on admission - and possibly patient may be more distressed in view of forced admission.  If patient lives alone than level of dysfunction that might occur in community post discharge is potentially greater as there are no persons available to limit such dysfunction\n\n\n ", "My Grandmother was admitted for a routine minor procedure on the advice of her consultant.  After the procedure she was fine but was kept in overnight.  Within 24 hours her condition deteriorated, this was written on her notes.  Over the next 12 hours she became very poorly and it seems like nothing was done.\nThe nurses continued to write the notes and say they were only nurses. A doctor never came,  a consultant never came. Within 10 days my Grandmother died.\nShe had gone in there perfectly well, we felt she was given little attention after her operation and totally neglected due to her age.  It seemed like there was absolutely no continuation of care.", "We saw your post about the care and treatment that your mother received in hospital, it sounds like you are upset with the service and concerned for how other vulnerable elderly patients would cope if they were in a similar situation.  \r\nOrganisations like ours try to reach out to people who need advocacy and additional support.

Sadly, not all areas provide funding for these services so we also campaign to raise awareness about stroke, demonstrating the need for our services, and encourage people to understand more about the long term affects of stroke.\r\nWe try to reach everyone who needs us, either through our publications or advertisements, which list our helpline number. \r\n\r\nWe also direct people to crucial services such as, ICAS an advocacy service for vulnerable people who wish to make a complaint about health and social care. https://icas.org.uk/default.aspx\r\nAs well as organisations like Age UK, who work endlessly to improve services and support for older people. https://www.ageuk.org.uk/\r\n\r\nI was sorry to read about your mother's health care problems and her suspected stroke. It is not clear from your email if your mother did have a stroke. Stroke is brain attack which occurs when the blood supply to the brain is cut off. The cause of a stroke can be a bleed (haemorrhagic stroke) or blockage (ischaemic stroke) in the brain. Because the brain controls everything that the body does the damage to the brain will affect bodily functions. The effects can be physical, psychological and/or cognitive.\r\nI have attached a leaflet about this for you to read if you need more information about stroke: \r\nhttps://www.stroke.org.uk/about/what-is-a-stroke\r\n\r\nIt sounds like you are not happy with the treatment your mother received. It might be helpful to speak to the Patient Advice Liaison Service (PALS). They provide confidential support and help to resolve problems and concerns with the GP and hospital. In addition, they can provide information on complaints procedures. They will also be able to direct you to an advocacy service in the area. Its really important to raise your concerns to the NHS so they can improve there services and resolve problems. To find out the number for your local Patient Advice and Liaison services you can contact NHS Direct on 0845 4647.\r\n\r\nPlease note you can download our full range of leaflets and factsheets free of charge from our website https://www.stroke.org.uk \r\nI hope this is helpful.  If you have any questions or would like to discuss anything further, please do not hesitate to contact us again.  The Stroke Helpline is open Monday to Friday from 9am to 5pm on 0303 30 33 100.\r\n\r\nYours sincerely\r\nStroke Information Service\r\ninfo@stroke.org.uk\r\n", "Our Mother was admitted to the James Paget before Christmas 2009, transferred to a rehabilitation ward & expected to improve sufficiently to be able to return home soon.\nShe was supposed to be referred to the Pain team due to intense pain in her left shoulder. As a stroke survivor the shoulder should have been investigated, she had also lost the use of her other hand, suddenly. Having allowed her to become so distressed due to the poorly controlled pain, she was crying out, pleading for God to help her. It was inhumane and lacked any dignity.\nHer physical and emotional state deteriorated at an alarming rate. She developed a large, deep pressure area requiring dressing. She was pushed through the corridors to the dressing area, often terrified & begging to die, to gain some relief. She remained in this state for many days. Our sister had to stay with her virtually 24 hours, to try to calm her.\nOn one occasion she was moved from her bed without the use of the hoist, which was supposed to have been used & was available. Due to her distress & deterioration I contacted the Adult Safeguarding team, as we were so concerned, who became involved.We were assured the situation would improve. Apologies were offered but she was so tormented by now.\nOne evening, some weeks later, she was declared nil by mouth due to a choking episode but nearly 24 hours passed without medication or fluids until we complained again. It was an horrendous situation.\nMany of the staff were wonderful, they were so understaffed but not enough questions were asked as to why this lady was in this state. Thankfully she became more comfortable in her final days, but the pressure area had deteriorated greatly.\nShe passed away in February 2010. The distress she experienced was undignified, terrified of being moved due to being in pain. Inadequate care.", "I was assigned to a Consultant at this practice after BUPA refused to pay for psychotherapy/further help (despite a comprehensive corporate-level subscription).\n\nThe Consultant was late, in my view, uninterested, spent only 25 minutes of ('up to 90 minutes' per the letter) first appointment and, after that (short) time pronounced that I was fine albeit they wrote and confirmed my diagnosis of BP2 to my GP. When I told my GP that I was unimpressed (I have reason to be very visual and good at assessing people from other disabilities/a previous career) they chided me telling me these people work very hard you know (they all seem to be on holiday when I need help). So I kept seeing them. In my opinion this nearly cost me my life; had I followed this Consultant's timescale, method and timing for an SNRI withdrawal I think I would have not seen 2011 New Year's Eve.\n\nMuch distress and too many drugs later it has just been confirmed that my diagnosis was wrong and I should never have been on the drugs that in my view took away my life for the last 18months-2 years. \n\nThis mental health unit is shabby, chaotic and has been disgraceful in it's lack of attention to what I was saying (I knew there was something wrong but felt was ignored).\n\nBased on my experience I would not recommend it.", "In my opinion the maternity unit is a disgrace. The midwifes who treated me complained about being busy all the time. Not even offered water all day.\nI felt like the people around me didn't know what they are doing. I would buzz to get someone and they come in, turn the buzzer off and say \"back in a minute\" and I had to buzz again an hour later. Happened all the time. Speaking to other patients there, they had the same.\nWaters broke and staff just used a towel to wipe it, it was still splashed up the wall hours later. Left to lay in blood due to 4 midwives not being able to get a drip in properly then did nothing to help clean.\nEmergency C-section left stuff in womb when should not have done, led to infection. Gone back to get that sorted, had to wait in pain on a hard chair for 6 hours in A&E, to be told they cannot scan for 3-4 days ! All the time all the water machines have gone. People walking around like headless chickens.\nWe spent 3 days in hospital having breast feeding rammed down your neck, i was awake for nearly 45 hrs, had blood transfusion, and still the midwife would wake me every 2 hrs to try baby on breast. I found this absolute disgraceful, demeaning behavior.", "Thank you for your feedback about our services and we are very sorry to hear that your experience has not met your expectations.

", "In recent times I've tried to ignore the stories I hear about how bad Milton Keynes hospital is. I've been encouraged by reports that changes for the better have been made, and maybe they have. Recently however, I had the \u2018opportunity' to experience the place for myself as a patient and in the textspeak du jour all I can say is, OMG!\nOn a recent Thursday I began experiencing stomach pains which by Saturday had become unbearable so after calling my doctor's surgery was advised to go to the Walk In Centre at the hospital. After spending two hours there they sent me to the Surgical Assessment Unit (SAU) on the first floor of the hospital. Almost the first thing I was told was that I shouldn't have become ill on a weekend, and especially not on a bank holiday weekend \u2013 which it was.\nI waited a further ten hours to see a doctor and have some simple blood texts, before being admitted, given some IV antibiotics and oral painkillers and left to my own devices with no information in a largely unmade bed. The only greeting was from other patients.\nIn the morning I received more antibiotics, an x-ray which they then lost (yes, really) for several hours, a further x-ray and then nothing. The following morning (Sunday) I finally received a visit from a lady consultant (apparently I'd been put under her \u2018Breast Team' \u2013 yes really) who told me I would get a CT scan that morning. I didn't.\nHer junior, after complaining about their boss loudly to anyone who'd listen and after several hours of very hard pushing from me, finally organised the only CT scan of the day, into which session they also slotted an urgent female patient from casualty. The story the whole time was \u2018It's a weekend. It's a bank holiday weekend. What do you expect?' Well actually I expect the NHS to deliver healthcare. Tesco's was open. Why not the hospital?\nFinally I was allowed to eat. However the food is the most unhealthy, unappetising and poorest quality imaginable. When they did succumb to an attempt at healthiness, for instance with a token piece of fruit, the pear I received was an inedible rock. \nI was constantly moved, not spending one night out of the three I spent in hell, in a single location. Eventually I found myself in Ward 20, whose staff seemed to specialise in criticising the methods and knowledge of the SAU ward staff. Minutes after my arrival in the ward, I witnessed a larger elderly gentlemen sitting in a chair by his bed wearing two inadequately small hospital gowns, one behind like a coat, one in front providing modesty.\nHe was asked to remove these for the laundry and was helped to strip. He had no underwear. He was then unceremoniously handed folded clean ones which he then had to change into, in full view of everyone coming and going on the ward, without any assistance. His curtains were not pulled, something he clearly couldn't do himself. Where is the simple dignity?\nOn another occasion I saw a nursing assistant helping to feed a man who never left his bed the entire time I was there. The assistant sneezed voluminously over the food, making no effort to cover their mouth, and simply kept feeding it to the patient. I gagged. I suspect inwardly the patient did too. \nOn the Monday night at about 7pm a fellow patient, presumably just fitted with a body waste bag, had a nasty accident in the only male shower room on the ward. He was forced to beg for some clean gowns and was clearly deeply embarrassed. The nursing staff went into the shower room with much tutting and sucking of teeth and placed some absorbent sheets of a disposable nature over the nine or so square feet of highly offensive poo slick and simply left it there to fester. It was still there in the morning at 7am, some twelve hours later, when I went in to use the shower. I pointed this out to a nurse from the morning shift who was highly critical of her \u2018lazy' colleagues.\nI was invited to use the ladies shower room which unlike all the gents I'd sampled in my travels has a sink plug so you can shave properly (although the mirror is on the opposite wall), has cold water for brushing your teeth and a shower which actually has a decent flow. Lucky ladies. Go breast team!\nFinally I, in concert with another patient also desperate to go, was forced to tell the staff that I was a very reluctant bed blocker and must be released or I would walk. I didn't even have to take out of my arm the final and seventh version of the endlessly leaking and self-ejecting canulas, as it fell out by itself like all its predecessors. As I write, I look like a bruised pin cushion. They issued oral antibiotics and let me go. You will be pleased to hear that I survived MK hospital. You might not however, and sadly a body was removed from my ward while I was there.\nIn my time there I never received any kind of \u2018orientation', any information or even a printed sheet with details of where the emergency button was or how to use it, or even where the toilets were, or visiting hours which change ward to ward or what to expect or when. Since staff I met never volunteered any information about my treatment I took to questioning them, when I could find anyone to give me eye contact, and this is how I discovered that, when pushed for an answer some people blatantly lie. Sorry, but that was my overwhelming experience of the staff interactions. \nI have really only touched the surface of the lack of information, constantly broken promises, poor treatment, contempt of patients and in-house petty rivalries and turf wars I witnessed in my four days of hell at MK hospital. And yes there are good people working there, but in my view they are swimming against a very strong tide.", "I'm not satisfied with the service provided at my GP practice and am going to change to a different practice.  I have found the appointment system frustrating and some of the staff unhelpful - phoned yesterday for an appointment and told there weren't any - I'd have to have a phonecall consultation this morning, but it would be first thing (I think this was said in an accusing tone and I felt that it was implied that I was a layabout).  I pointed out I could barely speak and phonecalls are difficult at the moment, to no avail.  Phoned up this morning, and hey presto, two appointments with a GP were magically available.  I think this is a ridiculous system!  \n\nAm also concerned about treatment provided by GPs - my boyfriend had severe digestive problems last year (needing toilet 30 times a day) and kept being repeatedly sent away by GP and told to wait another 6 weeks for hospital appointment.  He ended up requiring emergency surgery to remove his entire colon, which I believe could possibly have been prevented if treatment / referral had been prompter.

They did not do blood tests to confirm that blood was too thin etc and did not perform scan.\nThey admitted me to a ward where I was left for three days without seeing a doctor. No tests were performed. I started to lose a lot of blood and had a student nurse who started flapping her arms about and asked me what she had to do.\nI saw a doctor eventually, after I complained, and eventually had a scan which confirmed that my baby had died. The dates confirmed that the death occurred after withdrawal of medication. I had bruising up my arm from blood pressure equipment that wasn't working properly. I had infection in a vein from the cannula and no one has so far been able to answer why i was taken off medication. \nI have been told that I was mismanaged since my arrival in A&E, and that there are no excuses for the way I have been treated. I feel my baby died because of their lack of monitoring and care, and withdrawal of essential medication.", "I am the carer of a severely disabled young man with complex multiple disabilities. My son's physical disabilities cause him to fall and he is now unable to walk.\nIn 2007 my son had a serious fall which caused him to dislocate his shoulder, his hip and his knee. I tried to call an ambulance and was told that because its part of his pre-existing condition it was not an emergency and I had to contact his GP. \nI rang the GP and they refused to speak to me. They said that to speak to me, as his registered carer, would be a breach of the data protection act. My son has autism in addition to his physical disabilities and it was not possible for him to call himself.\nI tried for three weeks to get a doctor to attend. I finally met with the practice manager and after I was reduced to tears, they falsely accused me of being a \"violent and aggressive\" patient which has now been set permanently on both my son's and my record with no opportunity for redress. He was never treated for that injury and so now has lost the use of his left arm.\nThe same thing happened again in 2009. I tried again to get him help, and again the Drs refused to attend despite the ambulance crew calling the doctors for two hours. Now the doctors surgery refuses to treat my son or myself. Apparently this is perfectly legal.\nMy son fell again two weeks ago and had a suspected fractured hip. The ambulance crew felt that it was sufficiently serious to warrant medical assessment and this time he was taken to the local hospital. This time the hospital refused to treat my son.\nHe had to endure six hours lying on a trolley and the nurses caring for him refused to give him pain medication, and the doctors to assess him. They wouldn't even take his obs or register him - he was just left as if he was a slab of meat.\nAfter those six hours the doctor discharged him with no treatment, as he said that because my son has no GP they can't treat him!\nWe are normal British citizens, we are not foreign to this country and yet we are both now being denied access to medical care. I have tried everything I can to resolve this situation to no avail. I can't get a solicitor to fight this, as no solicitor will take this on. I don't want to have to fight through the courts just to be able to access the GP.\nIn my experience there is no adequate care for severely disabled people, and the treatment of carers like myself by some GPs in Norfolk has been frankly appalling.", "I am writing on behalf of my son who was admitted to the Caludon Centre under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act in 2011. This is our first experience of the new acute services for Rugby where according to earlier press releases we were promised much;- \n\n\u2022\t\u201cThe changes will mean better access for patients and carers to the right mental health services at the right time\u201d.\n\u2022\t\u201cMoving the in-patient facilities into the new purpose-built Caludon Centre is essential to ensure the right mental health services for the people of Warwickshire.\u201d\n\u2022\t\u201cMoving the in-patient facilities to the Caludon Centre will mean that patients can be treated in a new purpose-built unit that is more suitable for providing modern mental health care\u201d.\n\u2022\t\u201cWe have listened carefully to what people have said about these proposals and we support the option which will provide better access to safer, high quality mental health services for local people.\u201d\nMy son was initially admitted on a voluntary basis early in the year but was discharged 3 days later because of inappropriate behaviour, despite protests from the Community team that they had not been given time to put things in place for his return. He was admitted again to the Caludon Centre under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act 2 days later. \nOn one of my visits later in that month I arrived on the ward in the evening to find that in the words of the nurse he is off the ward. I was assured by the staff that he would only be away for 30 minutes. I waited almost 2 hours before leaving and asked the staff what would happen now, I was told that he had probably gone to the pub and that if he wasn't back in the next hour he would be brought back by the police. Is this what is meant by Modern Mental Health care? \nI subsequently understand from a member of staff that he was eventually returned to the ward around midnight brought back by the Police from his home. \nThe question needs to be asked how a patient under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act, who shortly before had to be escorted by 2 people within the hospital to the coffee shop, was suddenly allowed out of the hospital for free periods of 30 minutes?\nI am so disappointed with the care received so far, this is not the service we were promised, I don't feel that my son's condition has been fully understood or has it been recognised how quickly his mental health can deteriorate if he does not receive the appropriate care.  This should not happen as I understand that all of my son's previous records can be accessed electronically. \nI have just finished piecing together my Son's movements during the week before being admitted to the Caludon Centre. It appears he was rampaging with a semi dangerous weapon before being picked up by the police; this could have ended so badly. He made unwise decisions with his money that week also, spending a lot of money. So far I don't know where he got the money but I think it will turn out to be a bank loan which raises the question of how a bank can lend money to someone so clearly ill and also on benefits.\nIt was a great relief that he was finally detained so that he could receive the care he so desperately needs. However this was not before he had completely trashed his flat for the second time. The council flat is so bad this time that I am unable to put it right and if this is not done he is at risk of being evicted as it is clearly a Public health issue. Imagine my dismay when my son was discharged from Hospital two days after being admitted to go back to this horrendous mess which by the way is still in this condition.\nThis present acute episode has been developing since he voluntarily underwent an Alcohol detox in 2011 in order to get his life together. We had 2 fantastic months when he was without alcohol, was functioning well and really getting himself together. However after years of alcohol abuse I believe the abstinence has taken its toll of his mental health and he has found it increasingly difficult to cope and has finally resorted to other substances to replace the alcohol leading to his present condition. He was still not drinking when he was admitted to the centre and had been regularly attending AA meetings and was doing an adult learning class.\n\nSince the last acute episode many years ago, the Community team have worked tirelessly to help maintain my son's function in the community. It was only in the last weeks before he was admitted that the Crisis Team were involved in monitoring his care on a daily basis as he wasn't taking his medication as prescribed. \n\nI subsequently made a formal complaint to the hospital and the Care Quality Commission and received a letter of apology from the hospital about the lapses in the acute care given.\n", "hello please take some time to read this and reply. \nMy mother was admitted into hospital 2 weeks ago and unfortunately passed away a week ago. We think this is due to the careless nature of some of the nurses and doctors. First when we went to the doctor's surgery in Slough, they diagnosed her with just a cough and we were sent away for 8 weeks. She was given an inhaler, but we went back as it was not good and caused reactions, but they gave us the same response again. When we went to the hospital a&e, as she was coughing up blood, we were sent back home. \nFor 1 week my mom was coughing up blood and even had an ambulance take her to hospital at 2am \u2013 but they just sent her home, saying she had breathing problems. After that the doctors gave her a letter to be admitted to hospital \u2013 then only did she go to the AMU, where she had the suspected diagnosis of TB. \nAfter a while, she was moved into the paragon suite. There she received absolutely terrible treatment \u2013 from what we saw, most of the nurses did not seem to care about her. Nurses would take their time if she rang the bell and did not give much help. She told us herself the treatment was rubbish. \nThe doctors kept taking her blood and did not give her any more despite knowing she was low on blood, as she did die when blood was being taken out of her. She was said to have TB and being treated for that, but after we were informed her lungs collapsed and heart failed. Now after her 1st post-mortem, they have still not found the cause of death. \nI now want to know how they did not know what she was suffering from, and why she was sent home so many times and not treated earlier? Why was the care so poor, and why were they taking her blood for tests, after taking so much and not caring to give her more? And why did her doctor's surgery not send her to hospital when she was coughing up blood? And why the hospital were not caring for her on our first visit, when they took chest xrays, but sent her home anyway? Now what sort of care and hospital care is this?", "Thank you for sharing your story with us.

I asked for a referral to the Muscular Skeletal team for advice on correct posture and ways of coping in April 2007. Whilst waiting for this appointment I saw an orthopaedic surgeon privately who arranged a spinal x-ray and MRI scan. It was found that I had two severely herniated discs and showed signs of cauda equine which is a \"red flag\" indicator of the need for urgent medical attention. I had NHS surgery in October 2007 when I was told I was to remain flat in bed for the first 48 hours and in hospital for a further 48 hours. The nurses insisted I got out of bed much too early despite my protests that I was to remain flat and I was discharged in less than 48 hours. Sadly I have been left with significant nerve damage and constant pain. I tried to return to work on very much reduced hours but was retired on ill health grounds in January of this year. I will always wonder if I had received the correct diagnosis at the beginning and had been left flat for the first 48 hours after surgery if the outcome would have been different. I would much prefer to still be working and earning my own living instead of living off a very small pension and benefits.

The staff seemed to be too busy to take time with my relative, the ward was chaotic and other patients were agitated and distressed. My relative ended up being restrained and forcibly treated, incurring an injury and being transferred to the IPCU, a locked ward. \n\nWhere my relative was locked in a room all night, no toilet or water to drink, with the injury and not knowing where they were. I was not informed of the injury until a few days later. When I did try to photograph the injury and the bruises, I was surrounded by 5 nurses who I felt bullied and intimidated me. And wouldn't allow me to use my camera. \n\nThe IPCU is 'not fit for purpose', according to the Mental Welfare Commission and yet it appears nothing has been done to improve the conditions for patients there. They are not allowed pens to write with, unless supervised by 2 nurses in the activity room, which is kept locked and only open at certain times. Most of the rooms in this ward are kept locked. As a visitor I had to enter by the back door, through a number of locked doors and the staff kitchen. Meeting with my relative in the dining room and overlooked by various staff, either eating a snack, passing through or even washing the floor around my feet. \n\nNurses in the IPCU even rolled their own cigarettes in front of patients. Meanwhile patients were left to their own devices in the smoking room.  No-one to supervise them. Vulnerable patients at risk of physical injury and mental anguish. The only water available to drink was in the dining room which was locked, so no ongoing access to liquids. \n\nMy relative was transferred back to Lomond Ward. Where vulnerable patients were not properly supervised. One woman who had an observation room was found late at night in the male dormitory. My relative woke up to find her coming out from under his bed. No nurses to be seen. The police were often in the wards at Stratheden Hospital. Like sheriffs restoring law and order. But very distressing for patients and carers. \n\nI think that some of the psychiatric nurses at Stratheden Hospital need training in de-escalation skills. How to reduce the mental distress of patients. Rather than using force and heavy handedness. Then there would be less need for police intervention. The nurses were often in the staff room writing notes, making phone calls, having meetings and chatting to one another. I saw little interaction with patients except when the patients queued up at the drug trolley, 4 times a day. \n\nI have made a complaint to NHS Fife about the lack of duty of care, the poor treatment and human rights abuses, experienced by my relative in Stratheden Hospital. I am not confident of a fair or just outcome. I think that the voices of patients and carers are not respected and therefore the psychiatric establishment not accountable.\n\n", "My father initially entered ward 4 and did very well there, he progressed so well that he was transferred to ward 3 for rehabilitation. Within the first week in that ward his condition had deteriorated back to pre-admission levels, there appeared to be no communication between nursing teams and the concerns and experiences of the family were ignored to the point that a urine infection was ignored for three days and sedation was administered as the patient was being 'difficult'.

Transferred to the HDU unit, operated on and discharged a few days later. The operation was a life saving one and we appreciated everything that the hospital did. The care in hospital was excellent.\nOnce he was discharged that is when his problems started. \nHe was discharged with no antibotics and no dressings. After 2 weeks we could both see that his recovery was not as it should have been and his health was deteriorating. After several phone calls to the consultant's secretary to try and speak to the consultant who performed the operation, I was told that the consultant 'doesn't talk to the general public' and was told to go back to the GP. We eventually got an appointment with the consultant.\nThey said they would order an urgent scan and that the problem was 'bruising' from the operation'. 2 weeks we waited for the URGENT scan - and all that time his health was getting worse.\nThe radiologist who did the scan took one look at him and immediately said he had an infection and that she would put that in her notes.\n3 days after the scan, I phoned the secretary to see what the scan showed. The message from the consultant was 'post op inflammation' and they would see him in August.\nMy husband was admitted to A/E again in July and operated on again 2 days later. The infection had turned to abscess, and they had to remove one of his testicles.\nA formal complaint will be lodged and we will also be taking legal advice. Why am I having to describe my husband 'private parts' with a secretary? Why was nothing done for him sooner after several phone calls to get something done? Why was he discharged from hospital without antibotic/dressings?\nHe lost his testicle - and if something had been done sooner, before the infection took hold, and after 6 weeks we were still being told it was bruising from the op, he would not have been admitted again and go through another operation.", "Thank you for your feedback, I was very sorry to read that you were so unhappy with the care and treatment offered to your father, I can see that you have formalised these concerns and I hope that your concerns are addressed fully and to your satisfaction through this process.\r\n\r\nPaul", "Thank you for your  feedback.

I feel that this is not enough for someone who self-harms and asks me to kill her everyday. \nFrustratingly, I feel that the GP has been unwilling to refer her to any other mental health services. It feels like there is no additional support for people with Aspergers Syndrome and I'm being passed back and forth between GPs, MPs and PALS. \nShe has never been referred to an Aspergers specialist or a Speech and Language Therapist - two things she would benefit greatly from.

He made several attempts to end his life, each time he was taken to hospital treated for his injuries then sent back home. \nI phoned the hospital on several occasions begging them to admit him for psychiatric help but was told because he had alcohol problems they couldn't admit him so I asked the alcohol team if he could go into rehab to help with his alcohol addiction. Their reply was that they couldn't because he had mental health problems so it was a no win situation. \nOn one occasion when he had cut his wrist and needed an operation to repair the damage, he came home and went to see his own gp who prescribed him with 3 boxes of strong painkillers. Of course, being of suicidal mind he went on to try and overdose. He was found and again taken back to hospital to be treated and sent back home, even though I begged the hospital and crisis team to help him they said because my husband had told them he felt ok they had to take his word. I told them how it would end but they didn't seem intrested and signed off their team. \nMore attempts were made until in October 09, he suceeded in ending his life. \nI feel my husband, myself and our sons were let down. Why can't they listen to family who are with the person on a daily basis and witness their behaviour?", "I am extremely concerned about my husbands healthcare treatment in prison. Although generally I think the prison is a wonderful establishment and a good environment for him to be in, there have been lots of problems with his medical care. My husband had a heart bypass over ten years ago and has been on medication for his heart and other problems ever since. In March for some reason we were told he couln't have his own medication, and there were problems with repeat prescriptions which meant that for over a month he was without his medication. Shortly after he resumed his medication he was admitted into hospital with a stroke. \r\nI have tried to talk to those responsible for healthcare in the prison and have had problems getting past reception to talk to the managers and the right people who could help to sort it out. There seem to have been problems with communication because the messages that I left daily don't seem to have got through and this matter is now being investigated but I am extremely concerned and angry that my husband does not seem to have got the daily medical attention which he needs and is his right. \r\nAfter he came out of hospital there was not good follow up from the hospital so it was weeks later that anyone came from the stroke unit. \r\nFollowing his stroke the prison doctor suggested splints for him, but 3 weeks later when I spoke to the Disability Officer to try to sort this out, he knew nothing about it. \r\nI am still concerned about this my husband seem depressed and very worried about things and his general health is deteriorating.", "The crisis team and someone from the recovery team came to see me several days ago because my Social worker/support worker is worried about my state of mind. \nI was not sure about them helping me, but after 30 minutes of them arguing, and trying to change my mind I said yes, to there support.

A doctor in Warrington Hospital put the wrong stent in my heart and blocked off part of my heart. \nI feel it has been covered up for 3 yrs now and I'm sick of it. \nI got the ombudsman in and they called me to say that I had won my case then as far as I know someone stopped me from getting the report. I called the office and they will not let me talk to the person who told me I'd won my case. I'm now on a high risk list with my new hospital.\nI'm so gutted, I feel so angry with the doctor. If you can't trust the ombudsman, what do you do? I feel like it's one big cover up. ", "A first pregnancy, I had the usual anxieties but felt I had great service from the community midwives. With a pre-existing immunological condition, I was also given extra scans and appointments at clinic with one of the registrars - who was excellent. \nUnfortunately, in my third trimester, my blood pressure started to creep up. The risk for pre-eclampsia was slightly higher for me given my health, and this was explained very clearly to me. My antenatal care was then transferred from the community midwife to the midwifes in the hospital, who were wonderful, patient and caring, despite a very busy department! ! \nThe bad experience, unfortunately, was my labour itself. At 38 weeks, with rising blood pressure, the registrar decided it was best to induce me, and arraged for me to be admitted the following day. I arrived at the ward at 2pm, and the midwife attending to me explained that I would be given a pessary drug to soften my cervix, would be monitored via CTG, and would likely start IV drugs the following morning to induce contractions. I was happy with this explanation and knew what to expect. I was given the pessary about 5pm. My observations at this time were - very busy ward - clearly someone was in labour that I could hear - a few other unwell patients earlier in pregancy, I was in no way a priority and totally understood that, happy to read my book and let the girls get on with it. (I am a health professional working on wards, Know what it can be like! ) I started experiencing a mild cramping around 7.30pm while my husband was with me during visiting hours. By this time the midwives had changed shift. I informed the midwife looking after me, she explained this was normal, and often a reaction to the pessary.  So okay, fine, as long as everything's okay. This worsened during visiting, and again was told this was normal. My husband left at the end of visiting, being a closed ward, and I proceeded to pace the floors for the next three hours, as I was too uncomfortable to sit still. I was then rudely told by an auxilliary nurse to go to bed! I was put back on the monitor routinely, but had to buzz the midwives to say that I was unable to stay in one position as I was in too much pain. I asked if I could be in labour, she said no, just the baby moving now that my cervix had been prepared. \nThe next hour and a half were a mess with me continually at the desk reporting\n- I am in a lot of pain, are you sure this is normal? \n- I feel nauseous, and I've just been sick\n- I am now bleeding\nThe responses  were a mixture of, the babys head engaging, it's just your show, try to get some sleep, you'll feel better. I appreciate that first time mums are probably very anxious about everything, and I know that first labours are usually long, and inductions are usually long, but clealy I was distressed and at no point was given any reassurance. In fact, I was made to feel more like I was a nuisance. \n\nI was in a four-bedded bay, with three peacefully sleeping women, locked myself in a toilet to try and keep quiet. Only when I was standing at the desk, doubled over with my legs crossed, saying \"I am telling you, I need to push\", did she actually (patronisingly) offer to examine me. Within a microsecond of me on the bed, her face said it all. \"You're fully dilated! \" I handed her my phone to call my husband.  At 2.17 am, she took the brakes off the bed and proceeded to wheel it herself. As I said, I work in the wards, so I know how difficult that is- ran into someone else from another ward in the corridor who helped her run with the bed. In the lift, she said to me, \"You were awfully quiet! \" I am not sure what I was supposed to say that. \nArrived at labour suite, where a midwife, my saviour of the evening took over. Armed with quick responses and professionalism, I immediately felt in safe hands. She spoke to me directly, explained the baby was very distressed because everything was happening so fast, her heart beat was dropping rapidly etc, so they were going to do an episiotomy to speed things up. Two pushes, done. My beautiful daughter was born.  She was a bit blue at first, needed oxygen, her first Apgar score was low, but picked up quickly, and is perfectly healthy. And my husband missed everything!  He arrived eight minutes later. I know sometimes that can't be avoided, but in this case it could have! He can never get that back. People said to me at the time, shame he wasn't there to rub your back, hold your hand, help you push etc. More upsetting was the fact that I had no one, not even a midwife saying, 'great, 7cm, just a little bit longer', nothing... AND, might I add, not one drop of pain relief was given! \nBeing so angry about it all initially, was quickly lost with the joy of my new baby girl. I almost feel silly writing about this now, she's 19 months! However, I always felt I wanted to share my comments without making a formal complaint. I was fine, she was fine, once you're home that experience fades, but we both could have had a very different outcome. Imagine, I had been a more shy, meek person who didn't speak up...", "The auxiliary staff I came into contact with were unhelpful and dismissive. Buzzers were being ignored or patients told to wait as they were busy and would return asap. Which they rarely did. I complained to senior nurse about my mothers buzzer being placed out of her reach, hearing aids not being put in, her teeth not brushed, hair not combed, requests for toilet visit ignored and finding my mother very distressed as she had soiled herself. \nNurses seemed so understaffed that it was impossible for them to give the time required to attend to the needs of elderly patients who were hard of hearing or took longer to respond. Due to her level of disability I spent many hours on ward with my mother every day. I witnessed many incidents that I found totally unacceptable. \nI do understand that staff have a very difficult job to do under stressful conditions. Most of the nurses I met were kind, caring and doing a fantastic job, however the auxiliary staff were another matter entirely. \nOver the last 5 or more years my mother has been in Larkfield unit several times. Improvement is something I hope for but have yet to see.", "Called an ambulance to my house, as my mother was screaming with pains in her head, and was struggling to breathe. \nThe ambulance took us to East surrey and after 30 min the Nurse took bloods, and the after another hour the Doctor came and examined my mother, she asked some questions and we explained the symptoms.\nShe came back after about an hour to say that she had a urine infection, and gave us antibiotics. Said that was why she had a headache. She was discharged about 4 hours after having arrived.\nMy mother is 84 yrs old, she was staying with me and we were keeping an eye on her. \nWe got her to bed but she woke up shortly afterwards screaming with the head pain, tried to give her the antibiotic but she was vomiting the tablet back. \nI then rang her doctor explaining that East Surrey had discharged her, he sounded shocked and said to get her back there. \n\nI made the decision based on what I had seen to drive her to her own hospital which took another 15 mins in time. It was there that she was given a more detailed examination, a CT scan and was diagnosed with a bleed on the brain.\n\nMy mother subsequently spent time in The Hyper Acute Stroke Unit in a deep unconscious state, and has since died - this being the cause. I will never know if something else could have been done had East Surrey picked it up on this earlier.\n", "Our 75 year old father was admitted to Grimsby Princess Diana Hospital in January this year with breathing difficulties. 7 days later, after what we felt was a lack of care, and being assaulted by another patient (he was pushed to the ground face down on to his hernia causing bruising to his head and nose), and despite us being told he would be home within a few days, he suffered a heart attack and died less than 24 hours later. \nThis is now an open complaint case.

It sounds devastating that you will never know if things could have been different, had East Surrey Hospital acted differently. \r\n\r\nFrom what you have written, it sounds like your mother had a subarachnoid haemorrhage, which is a bleed over the surface of the brain. A common symptom of this is a sudden, very severe headache. This is often a very serious type of stroke and sadly, about half of people who have a subarachnoid haemorrhage will die. That said, there are some operations that might have been considered. As we are not medically trained, it is difficult for us to say whether your mother would have been suitable for an operation or if this would have changed the outcome. Perhaps it would help to discuss this with East Surrey Hospital. You could speak to their Patient Advice and Liaison Service, who can put questions to medical staff on your behalf and give you advice on the hospital's complaints procedure if you feel you want to go down this route.

To her credit she was and has finished a year at college retaking A levels, but at what price for those around her. there is no transition services it has been straight into an adult team for a young adult who lost almost 2 years to her mental health problems so had no resources of a adult to call on. \nIn our view there has been no family support for reintroducing a member back into a family, apart from a charity which has proved patchy and not around at times of crisis. Every one asks have you had a carers assessment but having had one it seems like it brings nothing at the end but a box tick. \nSadly my daughter have had periods with no CPN often at times of forseeable difficulties which we have been left to cope with, despite service responisbilities post section. \nNo one is interested if you do manage to screw up courage to feedback how things are going. During the most recent problems it was admitted to me I was monitoring yet no one told me this or asked if I was willing or had the personal strength and I had no faith from previous experience I would be listened to. \nSadly at one point the crisis team said the problem was not one they dealt with and recently failed to act when asked to by the recovery team. No one in the family patient or carer believe they are worth using\nRecently my daughter said she had never feltsupported since her discharge\nThe cost a now broken family and ill health for the primary carer, why no transition services and realistic family support which would have prevented much and enabled the patient to take on more repsonisibilites for herself and her conditon. \non balance her in patient care was difficult at times but lead by professionalism and compassion, at times there are good pockets but not frequently and this seems to be when all is going well.\n", "We are sorry to hear of the difficulties that have been experienced and thank you for sharing your story with us.\r\n\r\nOur Head of Community Services has advised that there should always be a transition period when someone is leaving CAMHS to enter adult services.   The age for this is between 16 and 18, at the Care Coordinators discretion.  We would expect the receiving service to be invited to patient reviews (CPA or other) and a transition plan agreed.  As part of this a handover period would be agreed and there may be some joint-working.  The appropriate receiving team should in-reach into Ash Villa prior to discharge.  Support for reintroducing the patient into the family would be best discussed prior to discharge.\r\n\r\nHowever if IAPT is required (Improved Access to Psychological Therapies), this would not be the case and a referral would be made to them and they arrange an assessment in one of their bases.\r\n\r\nAlso, if inpatient care was still required we would expect them to be transferred to an adult inpatient unit rather than discharged to the community.\r\n\r\nThe Carers assessment should be more than a tick-box exercise and there are Carer support groups who are best placed to provide general support for a carer.  We can assist in putting them in touch with such a group in their local area.  The CPN would have interaction with the carer though and be supportive particularly around education and understanding of the patient's condition.  However, we would need the patients consent to do this and sometimes that isn't always forthcoming.\r\n\r\nWithout further details we cannot be any more specific I'm afraid.

In the absence of any further details he has offered his apologies for the experience you have described.  In addition, he would hope the Recovery Team and CPN involved would have raised any concerns they had with the request they made to CRHT as part of their professional code of conduct and if they were not satisfied with the outcome then escalated it through the line management process.  \r\n\r\nWhilst not a very positive experience for you and your family, we remain committed in working with Service Users, Carers and relatives and stakeholder groups to help us improve people's experiences and aid their Recovery.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "My elderly mum who had dementia was admitted to hospital following a fall in her bedroom at the care home where she had lived for only 6 months. \nShe was taken to hospital in an ambulance at approximately midday and taken into A/E at her local hospital. \nShe was started on treatment which I presume was IV antibiotics and fluids and was also given an injection to help her breathing which was supported with oxygen therapy. \nI was not with her as I was out of the country but my sister was and she tells me that she expected mum to settle overnight and be transferred to a ward the following morning. The staff asked my sister if she needed to let anyone else know mum was in hospital and she said no because it was late in the evening and she did not want to disturb any of the other family particularly as she believed mum would improve. \nMum died after only 12 hours in hospital and neither my sister nor the rest of us were alerted to the fact that she was actually being treated as end of life.\nFrom what seemed an insignificant event of a fall with no apparent injury, she very quickly deteriorated and died in an acute setting at the age of 92 without those who loved her being there. \nThis has been a deeply upsetting event as we feel we were totally unprepared for mum's death and were not involved in any decision making at the end of her life. \nI feel communication was poor and that professionals did not explain what they were doing for mum to the family with clarity and compassion.", "Was diagnosed with Haemorrhoids by my doctor who sent me to see a consultant at southend hospital in June last year. Was told by the consultant I needed a operation as I had bad Haemorrhoids. I under went the operation in November early December. \n\nWithin a few days I developed a blockage was readmitted 2 days before new years day they unblocked me and I was told I needed to see a other consultant but before I could see him I needed a transit study off the bowl done so I was given a appointment to have it done in February 2011. Then had to wait 3 months for the results. In May 2011 I saw a consultant who I was told was a bowl surgeon I saw them in May and they just tried me on 1 dose off meds for 4 weeks then after the 4 weeks I returned to see them and they told me as that 1 dose off meds didn't work I'd need a operation on my bowl.\n\n I thought this person was a bowl surgeon but they were a general surgeon. Anyway they promised me that the operation was to remove a small section off my bowl and I'd be wearing a colostomy bag for 3 months then they would get me back in after 3 months and reverse my bowl back to how it used to be and it would be 3 months again before I would be alright and back to normal. \n\nWell what a laugh I had as they removed my entire large bowl and left me with just my small bowl and nothing else. They removed all my bowl and has not done the reversal at all and left me with the bag for life and now I've lost nearly half my weight I'm down to 8 stone.

On entering, I was surrounded by a number of patients and an incredibly open plan. First contact was with the reception area where I felt unable to report my feelings. I was very aware that there were a number of staff and patients listening to everyone reporting into reception and that there was little scope for privacy and confidentiality.\nFrustrated by this, I left the department.\nI returned home feeling even more hopeless and called the emergency mental health team to where I was waiting for my referral.

They advised me that they would make contact with the mental health nurses at Whipps Cross Hospital and would give me a call back with further instructions. They called back to say that they'd spoken to a nurse who would be expecting me at Whipps Cross Hospital after I had registered with reception and that I would be seen urgently.\nI made my way back to Whipps Cross Hospital.\n\nThe Complaint:\nMy first contact at the reception desk was with a member of staff who seemed to me completely disinterested in communicating positively with any patients. Sitting next to this member of staff was a nurse who looked bored and seemed to just be listening in to everything that they could. When I explained my problem briefly, with no privacy, they showed little interest or empathy. They took my personal details, gave me a red card and told me to queue up at the next set of desks.\nI queued for a further 10 minutes where I was seen by a seemingly disinterested receptionist who went through my details on a computer screen. I explained that a mental health nurse had been contacted and that they were expecting me. The receptionist sent me to a waiting room further down the corridor.\nI was sitting in this waiting room for approximately an hour before I was called into a side room by a nurse. They didn't say a word to me. They proceeded to put a blood pressure pad onto my arm. They still didn't say a word. They then started to look at the veins on my arms. I had not given they permission to touch me and they had not explained anything that they were doing. Angrily I asked what they were doing. The nurse replied that they needed to take some blood. I asked why and they said, \u2018It's just standard procedure. ' I told they that I didn't want any blood taken and that I was here to see the mental health nurse as had been organised via the telephone. I explained that I didn't need blood taken as my condition was not physical. They walked over to their telephone and said that they needed to make a phone call.\nWhilst on the telephone another nurse came into the room. They did not introduce themselves, did not acknowledge me and they sat down on another chair in the room, chewing gum and started talking to another nurse about their personal life. They exchanged comments in a joking manner. Frustrated, angry and confused I put my hood over my head to try and hide away from the situation.\nThe original nurse put the telephone down and said that they couldn't reach anybody. They told me to wait back out in the waiting room.\nI was in this waiting room for approximately four hours whilst people came and went. The nurse continually walked past me and made no attempt to update me on what was happening. When I am in good health I would usually question situations like these but in this \u2018broken' state I sat, waited, drifted in and out of sleep and became more and more hopeless in feeling that I was never going to get anyone to help me.\nApproximately six hours since I had come into the department for the second time I was called into the Accident & Emergency cubicle area. I was lead to a cubicle and chose to sit in a chair. I was unable to make eye contact with anyone and sat with my hood over my head. I was aware of the commotion here and the many patients being seen to. This environment made my symptoms worsen and I was finding it hard to think clearly. I wanted to close the cubicle curtain but in my despair I was afraid and unable to leave the chair that I was sitting in.\nAfter about thirty minutes a nurse of came into the cubicle and closed the curtain. They told me they needed to take my blood. I asked why and they responded the same way as the previous nurse. It was standard practice for anyone coming into the department. I agreed and they began the procedure. They then looked at my notes and in a trivial manner confirmed that I was feeling depressed. I didn't feel confident or capable of going into any further detail with them and just agreed.\nThey then asked my age and said, \u2018A young man of your age, you shouldn't be depressed! Life is hard for everyone; we've all been a bit depressed. My best advice to you is to go home and get a few bottles and drink your troubles away, it works. '\nThis comment turned my stomach, I asked them to leave the cubicle immediately.\nThirty minutes later another nurse came into the cubicle and looked at my notes. They did not acknowledge me at all, they left the cubicle without a word.\nTen minutes later another nurse came into the cubicle and told me that I was being taken to a ward with no explanation as to why. As we left the cubicle a doctor shouted for us to wait one minute. I went back into the cubicle and the doctor came in a few minutes later. This was the first person in the department in over seven hours to show me any empathy or consideration. In the brief conversation that we had this doctor acknowledged that I was feeling incredibly low and explained that I was going to be taken to a ward to wait for the Crisis Team to be called in to assess me.\nI left the cubicle and was taken onto a ward where I laid on a bed feeling incredibly exhausted and hopeless.\nApproximately two hours later I was assessed by a doctor and a nurse from the Waltham Forest Crisis Team. It was agreed that I would attend the Larkswood Centre the following morning at 10am and would be put under the care of the Home treatment Team. I walked home from the hospital in the middle of the night, alone, totally exhausted and feeling hopeless about the future.\n\nSubsequent to the complaint:\nI have since left London after three suicide attempts requiring attention in Accident & Emergency departments, two of these being at Whipps Cross Hospital in July 2012.\nI have also had two inpatient admissions into mental health assessment hospitals and have been diagnosed with \u2018Borderline personality Disorder' and severe depression after initially suspecting a diagnosis of and treatment for \u2018Bi Polar Disorder'.\nI am absolutely disgusted in the way I was spoken to, some of the comments made and the way I was dealt with by the \u2018professionals' working in the Accident and Emergency Department. I am incredibly unhappy with the processes and the time it took to get me, as a very vulnerable person in a state of crisis, seen by the correctly qualified person. I am disappointed that the stigma surrounding mental health is very clearly still a problem in Whipps Cross University Hospital.", "My mum died because of what I believe to be multiple negligence.\nI was with her in hospital daily for 5 months after a car accident, in which she broke both knees and a hip. As an academic researcher I witnessed first hand so many errors that compounded her original injuries, such as MRSA poorly diagnosed and treated that led to septicaemia. Nonetheless she was discharged home and abandoned, to be readmitted 10 days before her death with delirium and raging fever.\nThey had told her she needed to eat more egg whites because her liver function was poor! Even when readmitted, she was not given the attention she needed for the root cause of her infection (in her hip).\nThe pain was 11/10 and she died of a heart attack because of infection, pain, stress and neglect at 72 years old.", "I am so very sorry for your evident distress and your username in itself speaks volumes.

Deputy Director of Patient Services", "My husband had Alzheimers since 2009 and where as some people have it for years he went very quickly and from the start it seemed to affect his general health. He was in a residential from September 2011 and then became very poorly in May 2012 and I then fought for CHC and got him into a really good nursing home.\n\nHe developed shingles at the beginning of August. A GP was called he was given antiviral drugs but by the Tuesday his condition was a lot worse and a GP was called. They advised that he needed hospital treatment as he was unable to swallow so there was no medication fluids or pain relieve going into him. I agreed on the understanding that he would be admitted to ST Cross in Rugby as I do not drive and have to rely on public transport. \n\nAmbulance came at 6. 30pm and went to St Cross where they said no doctors would admit to having agreed to take him. That was the start of a 12 days from hell. They needed to get a line into him to take bloods and a nurse and doctor came. The nurse grabbed his right arm, this is where all the blisters were,  and the doctor proceeded to get the line in. I explained he needed to be told in a gentle and kind manner that they would not harm him. He was so afraid the nurse. Then said he needed to have some intravenous pain relief which was not available on that unit so she did go looking for some. \n\nI was told that he would be transferred to Coventry hospital. Then they said they had found a bed he could stay, then a few minutes later they came back and said no he was going. An ambulance came at 8. 45pm to take us over. When we got to A&E a nurse came and again there was no communication as to what was happening to him. I again told them to reassure him. A doctor came and said lets have a look at the rash. I said he has shingles. They went away. By now it was well past 11. 30pm the doctor came back and grabbed both his legs lifted them and let them drop, my husband cried out he was so unwell.  Only one bag of fluid was set up no more pain relief or antibiotics was started. We were then taken to ward 12 into a side ward I left at 2.00am that night to get a taxi back to Rugby. \n\nWhen I went back in at 11. 30am on the same day the side ward was empty and no one knew where he was he had been taken to ward 21. He was again in a side ward and after some time in the afternoon two doctors came to see him after a lot of shouting and trying to get responses from him I was informed that he was very poorly and that this had now become life threatening, but antibiotics was not started until 10. 00pm on the Wednesday. There was no fluid stand they would hook the bags of antibiotics to a hook on the wall at the back of the bed and fluids and pain relieve I had to give through thickened drinks which were very difficult as he was having problems swallowing and as not very keen on the drinks, they would bring his food by the door which was most days a bit of mash with gravy and yogurt there was never an attempt to liquidise foods he lost almost a stone in the 12 days he was there.\n\n I was there every day between 6 and 7 hours over food times most of the time I was completely ignored. There were some days they would just check him once and some days not at all, the only time the doctor spoke to me after the Wednesday was when they had missed calculated his medication. He should have come out on the Friday and when I asked on the Thursday what time will he be discharged they said no he his not coming out tomorrow and the doctor said it would be unwise to not continue the full course which would finish on the Friday. No update as to how my husband was getting on. Then on the Friday I said what time will he be coming out tomorrow. same thing, they had made a mistake I said no I am not having this you keep moving goal posts. I want to see his doctor and find out what is going on they said all doctors had left being as it was bank holiday after a senior nurse checked it was found the last course of antibiotics could be given on the Saturday. \n\nAmbulance was booked for midday. It never arrived, I was there for over eight hours. He came back to the nursing home on the Sunday.\n\nOne day I found the nurses shouting at him because he was anxious when they tried to change him. He left with bed sores and he was discharged under palliative care (END OF LIFE I WAS NEVER TOLD) the nursing home were wonderful and at least the last few days of his life he had lots of love and care. It was peaceful,  which he should have had in hospital.\n\nI felt very alone there trying to support my husband with no support from them. Also the NHS Website states shingles is not contagious? \n\n I am not finished with this, I have sent a report to PALS and intend to take this as far as possible. This was not the only time my husband had been in hospital. In 2011, when I was still looking after him at home, he was in C&W then transferred to St Cross came home covered in bruises but I never found out why. \n\nThere has to be better treatment for people with dementia who go into hospital. As a relative you are devastated enough when coping with the decline of your loved one to this terrible illness, you need to know they will be loved and looked after if they go into hospital. \n\nI am left a widow at 65 he was a lovely husband and every one says how lovely kind and gentle he was. He deserved better and so did I.\n", "About one month ago it came to my attention that after I and my daughter left his practice, our former GP inserted letters in our NHS records in which he wrote that I am mentally ill, am prone to make \"wild and libellous allegations\" about doctors and that my daughter has inherited the same tendency from me.\nThese letters have interfered with and deprived us of our right to health care for at least 15 years. I, in particular, will not register with any GP who treats me as though my spinal injuries do not exist and that I am mentally ill. In fact I have written evidence that I broke my back and neck in a car accident and because of the GP's errors developed arachnoiditis (an incurable spinal disease), that the GP misdiagnosed my injuries as being whiplash, and that several doctors covered up his errors by manipulating medical evidence and writing medical reports saying - untruthfully - that I had whiplash and was psychologically disturbed. This is clearly a matter for the police.\nI have recently complained to the SHIPs (Southampton and other PCTs) complaints dept at Omega House, Eastleigh. They denied receiving the complaints (despite this being sent Recorded Delivery and a signature obtained) and have refused to accept my and my daughter's complaints for investigation.\nDoes the Omega House SHIPS cluster understand that by refusing to investigate my complaints, they may be seen to be assisting in covering up the irregularities of the various named doctors?", "You will have to excuse me I am quite emotional on this subject, and also speaking to you in sharing my ordeal.\nI just want to tell you a little about my husband, and the treatment he got in this hospital.\nMy husband was diagnosed as suffering from Alzheimer's and was unable to communicate with people; really he was in a world of his own. I looked after my husband for 8 years. I loved him, cared for him, and looked after all of his everyday needs.\nYes, I got some help after some time, through going through meetings and social services, Age Concern and Citizens Advice. I was able to get free vouchers to help me to get a break.\nAt first I got one hour for 3 days each week, which I was grateful for. However, no sooner had I got out, I was heading back- it was all lock watching, which was quite stressful.\nSome time later on, I received more vouchers of which I then got 3 hours per day, 3 days per week- which was much better. I was then told I could get a Saturday morning, which was lovely- but my vouchers were stopped! I was told I had to start paying for care.\nMy husband used to like to walk. Yet as his condition worsened the walks got shorter and slower, but he was with me and that was all he wanted.\nWe had been married over 50 years and he was always a lovely happy person. My husband's condition deteriorated and he had to be catheterised.\nIn January, he went off his feet. The Doctor was called and from experience as soon as they see a catheter- it is always (an infection) before the urine is even tested. The doctor checked his chest and prescribed antibiotics. Then she said we don't sent urine infections to hospital. But during the night he got worse, and by morning an ambulance had been called.\nWe travelled to Blackburn Royal and on arrival I was informed that my husband had a touch of pneumonia and not a urine infection. At this point, he was admitted to B4 ward. I noticed how well cared for he was on this ward, I visited everyday, sometimes at lunch to help feed him.\nI always looked and read the notes at the end of his bed to see what drinks or food he had consumed. Also to see if he was being turned regularly and given personal care.\nThere was a young student nurse on this ward who took the time to talk to my husband, and just touch his hand, and his face would light up. He was no longer able to walk so I could no longer look after him much to my sadness.\nIt was arranged that a nursing home in Burnley was going to undertake an assessment of my husband's needs, and if he would be accepted for residence at the home in Burnley. To my shock and surprise, he was taken by stretcher to this home and admitted at 9.30 at night. He had not been assessed and the staff were also surprised on his arrival at their home.\nHe was at the home for 6 days then sent back to Blackburn Royal. Then he was on the admission ward until a bed could be found on the medical ward. Later that afternoon he was taken to D3 Ward.\nI went to visit my husband, and the Admission Ward had not sent any of his clothes and belongings up to the ward, so I went down myself to get them, I was surprised to see a man already in the bed but thankfully he hadn't gone in the locker.\nIt was no wonder I was getting stressed and upset, at this stage on my arrival back on D3 ward my husband was put on a 6 bed ward, put in the far corner, curtains around him and the door closed.\nHe was in someone else's pyjamas, unshaven, and had a terrible mouth. He had his own teeth, but his lips were stuck to his teeth, and his tongue was red and sore and badly cracked. At this stage I was horrified! I asked for mouth sponges and I cleaned his mouth the best I could, but it needed doing more often.\nA couple of days later, I went to see my husband at 2.00 pm. I noticed the drip he was attached to had been leaking. His bed and pyjamas were soaking wet, along with the sheet of which had now gone very cold. The fluid only comes out a \u2018drip at a time'- how long had he been wet and in this state?\nThe machine was also bleeping lots but with the ward door closed it couldn't be heard.\nImmediately I called the nurse she replied \u201cthe doctor needs to put it back in\u201d then another nurse came in to the turn the bleeping machine off. I then said again \u201cMy husband was very wet and cold.\u201d\nWhilst I waited thinking the staff might be coming straight back to change the bed, I realised he had not been shaved again. So I asked the visitor in the next bed if she would mind me making a noise with the electric razor. I shaved him and whilst still waiting I cleaned his mouth again. I rolled the top sheet up a little to take away some of the wetness from the top of his body- whilst still waiting!\nIt was now 1 \u00bc hours since telling the nurse about the drip leakage. I looked at his wrist band and noticed it was in someone else's name. I was so disgusted at seeing this I just broke down, and possibly shouted as well.\nI must have because nurses seemed to be all around me and must have heard me in such a stressful state- even with the door closed. I was so mad and angry, but to put the finishing touches to it- the nurse in her way dismissed it say \u201cwe don't go off that, we go off the notes\u201d. I responded telling her that it was load of rubbish, and it was very important. I said if he had died he would have gone to the Mortuary as this other person, because the notes would have stayed on the ward.\nLooking up at the bed head, they had spelt our name wrong, and the nurse replied it was her scrawl, but that was never put right. Now things were moving. After my tears- a student nurse came to take the drip down, she had gloves on so I realised she couldn't feel the wet sheets, but by now you could see a water mark drying on the sheet.\nThe nurse started to cover up my husband with rolled up sheet. I responded by saying \u201cit's like that because it's wet\u201d, she responded by saying \u201coh yes\u201d then she just went away- maybe it's not her job?\nI had to leave at 3.50 pm to catch my bus that was almost 2 hours since being told. It could have been another 2 hours after I left. Nobody could be bothered.\nThe ward where he was, in all honesty, my feelings are- that he was put in a far corner to die!\nMy husband was quiet and needs not a lot. He has his drip up. I am sure he was left to himself. He was never shaved, never washed and never had his hair combed. And I know for a fact his pyjamas were not changed because I had marked under the collar. He must have been so uncomfortable.\nThe doctor then rang me at home and I knew he was very poorly, and with my consent the drip was taken down. At this stage I was told he would be made comfortable and die in his sleep. The day after, he was sick bringing up yellow bile. I went to inform the nurse and she came right away.\nI had to assist her to move him onto his side. She then wiped his face and left. One hour later I had to go again and find a nurse. I said \u201cI know my husband is dying, but he does need changing from all this sick!\u201d 2 nurses came. They never spoke, never sponged him down. They just put a gown over the top of him instead of his pyjamas. Maybe this was easier for them!\nThe next day my husband died under your care. Did I just say care? There must be another word for it. I know exactly what it is. It's neglect.\nIt would have taken so little for someone just to sit in a moment with the dying, just to say a few words, just to touch their hand, and give them a little reassurance that you care.\nYou talk about \u2018end of life care'. In my eyes, a dying person should always look neat, clean and comfortable, which then in turn will give comfort and acceptance to family and relatives in their final moments. I didn't get that, maybe this is why I cannot get this matter out of my head.\nI hope this story has made some of you emotional as it has me and maybe some of you act- as it is factual. I just hope and pray I never have to be a patient in this hospital after this experience.\n", "I am still detained in Guild Lodge. I have been here for over a year from the very start of my detention. I asked how long I would be here for (more or less). I feel I have never had a straight answer to this question. I don't think I have put a foot wrong since I came, I have engaged with staff and attended a full activities programme, and I am still on a medium secure unit with no plans to release me - at the moment, I should have been told 'at least 18 months to 2 years', but instead there has been no reference to any time scale. This is cruel and I believe it is undignified and against my human rights. I consider myself to be mentally stable, but am frustrated as there is no apparent end to this nightmare. I still have had no clear care pathway designated apart from a referral to a low secure unit which again, I have not time-scale for. \nI was sent here on a mental health section against my will and have never once considered that my illness is of a nature or degree that warrants continued detention.", "Firstly, I am very sorry you do not feel satisfied with your care and treatment within our in- patient unit Guild Lodge, and that you are understandably frustrated with the lack of certainty around your discharge arrangements. Despite your distress, it is commendable that you have engaged in all aspects of your treatment.\r\nUnfortunately the anonymous nature of this forum, to protect confidentiality, limits the scope of my response but I welcome this opportunity to address your queries, and would welcome any further discussion if you feel able on a more individual level.\r\nYou have referred to being detained in Guild Lodge for longer than twelve months. This is a long period for anyone to stay compulsorily in a psychiatric hospital. Unfortunately the length of detention is never fixed at the outset. The decision to discharge anyone from detention is guided by the clinical progress made and any future risks to self or others. Although it could be extremely frustrating for the individual, one cannot predict at the time of admission as to how long it could take for anyone to be ready for discharge.\r\nDetention in a psychiatric hospital under the Mental Health Act 1983 is distinct from a determinate prison sentence which stipulates the date of release from prison. A determinate prison sentence has a punitive element \u2013 it is intended to punish the defendant for the offences convicted. On the other hand, detention in a psychiatric hospital has a therapeutic purpose, to support and care for the person on the road to recovery. The law provides that a person should be detained for treatment as long as it is clinically necessary, ensuring that individuals receive appropriate care and treatment for the necessary length of time. It therefore is not always possible to give a precise time scale for discharge from a psychiatric hospital. If an established set length of time was committed to initially this may hinder recovery and undermine treatment goals by colluding with idea of time \u2018served' rather than time used for appropriate treatment. Your detention is reviewed regularly to ensure that it is necessary and the only option available to meet your mental health needs and manage your risks. The Trust always endeavours to treat anyone using the least restrictive option.\r\nThe Act contains provisions aimed at protecting your rights and liberties. Within Guild Lodge you have full access to this process supported by free legal advice if required. The Trust encourages all the individuals admitted to Guild Lodge to actively participate in their treatment and recovery. We have adopted the \u2018My shared Pathway' recently to improve the communication between the clinical teams and the service users, empowering individuals to take responsibility for their own progress. It allows, and actively encourages service users to negotiate outcomes during their recovery.\r\nAt Guild Lodge we have a number of mechanisms to promote participation of the detained service users in their treatment and progress. Service users and their families are given relevant information about Guild Lodge as soon as they are admitted. Ward Rounds (also known as Patient Care Team Meetings \u2013 PCTMs) and Care Programme Approach Meetings (CPAs) are held regularly to review clinical progress. We encourage active participation of all service users in these meetings. We also encourage the clinical teams to share the necessary reports and minutes of the meetings with the detained individuals (as appropriate). Active engagement in therapeutic activates greatly enables the clinical team to monitor progress of an individual.\r\nWhen a clinical team concludes that the individual could manage in conditions of lesser security, a referral is made to that part of the service. Sometime there is a waiting list for availability of a place as the resources within the Guild Lodge are limited. The clinical teams regularly monitor such transfers to minimise any delays and make every effort to prevent delays in transferring of service users to less secure areas.\r\nIndividually service users who have concerns about any specific aspects of their treatment can raise this in a number of different ways, by contacting the advocacy service (which is independent to the trust), writing to the ward manager or the Responsible Clinician, contacting the solicitor, or by writing to the Customer Care Department of the Trust.\r\nWe also have a number of service user forums and events where we actively listen to service user feedback. This forum include service user champion meeting which is held once month and a champion business meeting that is held on a weekly basis. If you feel you would like to discuss any aspect of your care and treatment with me directly, please contact me at Guild Lodge on 01772 406637.\r\nThank you\r\nSusan Tighe\r\nDeputy Network Director\r\nSpecialist Services\r\nGuild Lodge", "Lincolnshire Community Health Services NHS Trust, as providers of some services at County Hospital Louth, would like to add our sincere condolences and apologies to those of United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust on the loss of your mother and the distress suffered by both of you.\r\nWe work in partnership with our colleagues at the hospital.

He was thankfully stopped and spent the night at Darent Valley hospital. When he was there he was placed under the local crisis team at Dartford and given a months worth of medication.\nFast forward to now my brother is no longer medicated due to him, the crisis team and every other team letting him down in my opinion. He has been passed from each team with promises of help but we're yet to actually receive any useful help. In these few months he's seen them all of 3 times. When he saw the staff they made promises to see him the next week or to call him but they never arrived or called. There have been times he has walked to the centre in the rain and the staff member had gone home without even cancelling the appointment.\nIt's not right to treat someone that way especially not a young man who's very low and also has additional needs. I've had my brother on the phone crying many times as in his words 'The team has ditched me, they don't care' . They made promises of helping him with housing, psychologists to see him but nothing has happened. I have called them, along with other family members, begging for help when he has been suicidal just to be told they can do nothing if he wont talk on the phone.\nI rang the outreach team a few weeks ago, they refused to tell me what is going on but promised they would ring my brother, guess what, still no phone call.\nMy brother is homeless, depressed with an unpredictable mood which is making life hard for everyone.

In April 2011 she fell and broke her hip. She was admitted to the Royal Oldham Hospital where she had an operation to pin the broken hip the next day. Unfortunately the surgeon had delegated responsibility to his registrar who had pinned the hip incorrectly. The operation had to be repeated by the surgeon. Whilst operating, the surgeon decided that a full hip replacement was the best option. \nUnfortunately, this was not the end of it. The new hip became infected, which resulted in mum being drip fed antibiotics for 6 weeks whilst remaining bed-ridden. As you can imagine anyone with Alzheimer's has no idea what is happening to them and mum's mental state deteriorated rapidly. \nShe also had a fall on the ward and broke her wrist. I asked if there was a dementia ward and the answer was 'no and they cannot be watched all the time'. She fell again and broke her other hip, which was pinned. \nAll in all she was there for around 6 months of hell. On release, she is now mostly wheelchair bound, needs constant care in every aspect with mostly no knowledge of where she is, who she is, who we are etc. She is now back there again with infection and most of the staff seem no better. Her mental state is worse and she lashes out. Most of the staff appear to have no idea how do deal with dementia. Often they don't know what medication she is taking, although we have told them. Nurses they almost always say \"I've only just come on duty so I don't know\".\nWe have offered to go to help at mealtimes and with medication but they don't want it. They don't know her history at the hospital, which I find bizarre. Are records not kept on a database that they can look up? \nAnyone with relatives who have dementia and need to go in the ROH - keep a close eye on what is happening.", " There has been much comment both in the paper and on television about the Liverpool Pathway, especially so since a number of patients have recovered after intervention by relatives despite hospital staff being against it. I had never heard of this until my niece mentioned about end of life protocol as my mother lay gravely ill in hospital. As you will see, like the media says, the Protocol was not followed. I was never informed what they were doing, why or when. The hospital doctors did what they did without consulting anyone.\n\nA nurse in charge was particularly unhelpful to say the least as was one ambulance driver. Instead of contacting me as he should, I found it very difficult to see the consultant. What is worse, I now find the hospitals are paid extra for every patient they put on this pathway. Also that in some hospitals the death rate is much reduced following them being paid extra to keep patients alive. \"If a cash bonus results in more lives being saved then what that is really saying is that normally the hospital allows people to die when they could be saved. The money does not directly affect the care, it only affects the mind-set of the people providing the care. They COULD save more lives, but they really can't be bothered without additional money as motivation.\"  This is from the Daily Mail Online.\n\n I am told I am not allowed to name names and perhaps the hospital involved but have very little faith in this hospital and some of its staff who failed us all. I and many others will now feel strongly about what may be another national disgrace.\n\nThis is but a mere cut down version of my original opinion.\n\nMum was ill and an out of hours doctor found all to be okay except for a  severe urinary infection, making a prescription. Whilst this was correct it did not have the usual effect so I called NHS Direct and explained position to a nurse, then a senior nurse who advised hospitalisation and an ambulance took her to hospital.\n\nLater that night a doctor rang to ask about medical history and said Mum had pneumonia from listening to the chest and an X-ray. Antibiotics being given. A woman was changing the catheter (odd because it should have been changed the night before when it was blocked). I was told by her to wait in the common room and would be told when they had finished. 25 minutes later no-one came to inform me so I went to the bedside, all finished and the woman was busy elsewhere. I asked her if he could see the nurse in charge to find out how things were. She repeated the question and went off. No-one came after 15 minutes. I asked again at the desk and was told someone would see me. Eventually the same woman came and asked if I wanted to ask about mum. Apparently she was a nurse. She certainly didn't act like one and her attitude to a few simple questions about my extremely ill mother were not compatible with her job. Mum was on a saline drip but only a quick attempt with an NG tube to administer liquid nutrients was made and abandoned. Mum also had an oxygen mask.\n\nA doctor rang to point out further complications and said further decisions would be made after the weekend. In my opinion, it is now a well known fact to all who read the papers that at weekends there is a lack of more experienced doctors available and that the death rate of patients goes up as a consequence.\n\n Mum did not respond to the antibiotics and I was informed she may not live very long. On the Monday morning I found the drip and drugs had been removed but could get no reason why from the staff. I asked repeatedly to see the consultant and after some hours he saw me for the first time. He showed me a scan and said there was hope and that mum was in a vegetative. He said giving further antibiotics for the infection would not in effect help the brain and reattaching the saline drip would if anything only increase pressure on the brain. In his view the best thing was to leave things as they were and let nature take it's course. Death would come within hours or a few days at most. \n\nIf all had been done properly and explained beforehand I would not have felt so bad. They should not have initiated the Liverpool Pathway without my permission.\n\nWhen later that day they even removed the oxygen mask I asked for mum to go home with me. Some hours later this came about. I had to write a dictated letter and sign it first. I will say one of the ambulance men was very sympathetic but his partner was to put it mildly extremely unhelpful. I could say much more!\n\n Mum died 4 hours later in her bed as she would have wanted whilst the district nurses were in attendance. I saw her draw her last breath, a moving experience. Mum would have been happy knowing she died at home in the care of one she loved and held on long enough for this to happen. \n\n I believe mum was in a dire situation and would have died anyway but the way she was treated and the failure to notify me beforehand regarding the Liverpool pathway was disgusting. It is a time when relatives need as much information as possible so that they and only they can make the choice whether to proceed. I feel sure countless others have had bad experience with this so called Liverpool Pathway and the way it is administered. I see reports that some patients have actually recovered with help from loving relatives despite reproval from attending medical staff.\n\n\n", " The Queen Elizabeth in Gateshead placed my grandmother (Nana) on the liverpool care pathway (LCP) without informing my Grandma, or any of us, her family. We would have removed her, if we had known what was planned by the staff of this hospital. On several occasions, my Gran, was ready to be discharged then contracted more bugs from this hospital.\n\nWhile Gran was in this hospital she contracted MRSA super bug. My Gran was a fighter, and recovered from this hospital super bug. Soon after, she contracted E. coli and Klebsiella.\n\nNana was in and out of hospital from October until her life ended April of this year.\nThe catalogue of events that unfolded in this time period, were nothing short of disgusting in my view. She had been admitted to wards that were filthy, Her bed, was beside the bins, on many of her earlier admittances. On one particular occasion the floor was stained and filthy under one of the bins, it was similar to a dirty bus shelter. I reported this to the staff and they cleaned it. It was still very dirty and they said it was rust marks from the bins. I touched the floor, and the dirt was still coming off on my fingers.\n\nOne particular occasion she was given a sleeping pill, and allowed to go to the toilet by herself, Gran fell asleep on the toilet and fell off the toilet and on to the floor and bruised her head and face and neck so badly, she looked like a car crash victim. We still have pics of this on our phones. In fact the bruising and swelling was so severe, she still had bruises from this, at the time when she died. Other patients visitors thought she was in hospital for those injuries, because they looked so horrific. People kept approaching her asking her how she received her injuries.\n\nThe final admittance was by far the worst.\n\nMy Grandma's was addmitted into hospital with a broken hip in early February. She fell at home. After the operation medical staff removed the stitches and the wound reopened and became infected. She had to go for another operation to have the wound washed out and reclosed. This was apparently dangerous, yet she pulled through this too.\n\nI am her Granddaughter. The horror commenced, the head nurse informed us that my Gran had gases in her stomach, that would be naturally absorbed into her body, nothing to worry about. The very next day we were told she was dying, and would be dead soon, this came as a great shock, as we had just been told she was fine. I felt that the staff were blunt and without feeling, they just dropped the 'bomb shell' without a meeting or discussion of any kind. 'The new out of the blue diagnosis they disclosed to us was Gran had poison leaking into her stomach from her bowels. There was a slim chance this would close and repair itself. My grandmother said she was not in pain, and she had no fever, and seemed fine. The hospital staff seemed to  starve and dehydrate her for days, and moved her table out of her reach. She even commented to me, about this, saying 'look they have moved my table, so I cant reach it, its like I don't need it any more'. The hospital did not tell any of us, they were putting her on the LCP They told us, they were keeping her comfortable this was we felt very sneaky, it appears 'keeping comfortable is the title of Liverpool care pathway. Well it certainly is, if you don't want the patients family to know. We were led by the hospital to believe she was dying naturally, and they were keeping her comfortable with morphine and other drugs. The hospital staff certainly did not tell us it was the LCP. At that moment in time, none of us had heard of LCP and did not know it even existed, until I heard a doctor mention it, like it was a paracetamol or something of no real interest.\n\nThe hospital started by giving my beloved Grandma injections of morphine in the hand, and a lot of pills with no more than a mouthful of water to swallow them. Gran said to the nurse I need more water to swallow those pills', and the nurse give her a tiny bit more, and said she shouldn't be doing this. The nurse said I am not supposed to give her more water. Grandma was tired, but was still conscious at this stage. she was given no food and no drinks. My gran could talk to us, at this stage, she forced herself awake to talk to us, her visiting close family. The next day Gran was given further injections too, and was not allowed food or water for two days. The next morning my youngest daughter and her friend visited my Gran, they found her sleepy from the drugs and lethargic due to lack of nourishment and hydration. I visted in the afternoon with my eldest daughter. We arrived just as my youngest daughter was leaving. To my horror when I got there, she was so heavily sedated she was unaware that we were there, with her. My Gran appeared semi comotozed from drugs from the syringe driver. That was not her, at all. The hospital did not ring or inform any of us, they just went ahead and started the morphine driver while we were not there, with her. It seemed to me, it was done, so it was under way before we arrived. The whole time I was unaware what it was. If she could have woken she most certainly would have. I was so concerned, and went and asked to speak to a doctor. A doctor came down as I said I was concerned about her breathing. I asked them why they had stopped all her crucial medication, heart pills etc. They said she did not need them. I asked the staff to feed her, or at least, give her fluid and antibiotics. They refused without an explanation. I knew this was not right. How could she possibly have a fighting chance, without her life saving drugs and fluids. Every living thing needs fluids, and when a person is sick, they usually need more fluids.\n\nThe hospital had linked her up to a syringe driver and it felt like they left her there to rot. They popped in to see her only several times in a 14 hour period. This was to move her. moving my Grandma caused her to be anxious, and she started shouting groaning. I called my family to come to her bed side, as I knew she looked very poorly at this stage. The hospital did not provide oral care or anything, that would be of benefit to her well being. We requested the mouth care, as it was common sense that she needed this, as her lips were sticking to her gums, and she kept sticking her tongue out, as it appeared she was desperate for water. It felt like no one monitored her health, or checked if she was improving. Nana eventually received mouth care only when we requested it for her. She would not have got this, if we had not asked for this for her. It was very distressing, Gran could not talk, and did not know we were there. She pulled herself up several times and shouted 'help'! and home! It was as if she was asking us to take her home? We just sat there powerless, as the staff assured us, she was fine, and none of us new the full extent of what was happening to her. We sat from 1. 45pm until she sadly passed away at 3. 55am early the next morning.\n\n \n\n", "My relative underwent private surgery under care of York Suite.\n\nI have submitted complaint to health professional council over a radiographer at the BRI who I believe was abusive and slanderous towards my relative. The hpc had to tell me who this staff member was as the hospital refused to tell me. One reason they said it was too difficult for them to find out who it was as they have so many staff. Second reason was they were obliged not to reveal such information. I work in the NHS myself and found the staff to be talking utter rubbish in order to fob me off.\n\nIt appears staff may have nearly overdosed my relative with meds on one evening on another evening I understand they missed them off the meds ward round completely.\n\nA porter there was angry with staff as they made him take my relative down to X-ray in a wheelchair. The radiographer down in X-ray said staff should have taken my relative to X-ray on their bed and not forced them into a wheelchair. This radiographer urged my relative to submit a complaint. The pain my relative experienced had them in tears. They were in tears every single day of their stay at this hospital.\n\nOn one evening, staff had my relative up until 3am in agony as two members of staff struggled for 45 minutes to insert a catheter.\n\nAt the end of the stay and numerous complaints I submitted, staff were surprised to find out that my relative had paid for the treatment and they didn't even know they were private.\n\nThe day after surgery my relative found a small tube still inserted in them from surgery which should have been removed.\n\nThe room they stayed in was never cleaned properly in the week my relative stayed there. I washed my relative down when I visited twice a day, and the bed sheets which appeared to be blood stained from surgery weren't even changed until the 3rd day. \n\nIt is now 3 weeks since the initial complaint and I am still awaiting a response from the hospital. I very much doubt they will issue an apology.\nAbsolutely disgusting treatment and attitudes - would not recommend for anyone. If this is how private patients are treated, god help NHS patients.\n\n", "My mum is currently in the Glenfield hospital, Leicester. She is too scared to comment about the care that herself and others on her ward are receiving, which she feels is disgraceful. \nI have witnessed some of the attitudes of some of the nurses who I feel sadly bring down the name of nurses who do care. I have been consoling my mum for the past three days and have well and truly had enough but cannot do anything as I fear she will be treated even worse. Things like:\n- her cannula popping out of her arm and being left for four hours, as the nurse reported being too busy\n- painkillers prescribed first thing in the morning by the Dr, yet waiting ten hours because again they are too busy\n- being given insulin when she is not supposed to have it\n- not getting her diabetes injection all day as there simply isn't time, then getting told she can't leave because sugars and blood is unable to stabilise\n- being told off as mum asked for breathing apparatus, then it being plugging in high above her - forcing mum to ask for assistance. At this point the nurse stretched the wire whilst mum had to manoeuvre herself in a contorted manner, then the whole thing blew up in her face. The nurse laughed and walked off. \n\nDisabled and elderly with compounding health concerns - no wonder she cries on the phone to me at night. I have witnessed this treatment with others on the ward also - help these poor OAP's to have dignity, to be listened to.", "Both Basildon Hospital A&E and the Fracture Clinic missed that I had broken my foot in 5 places and also my arm. The Triage Nurse said it wasn't necessary to X-ray my arm as she thought it seemed OK. I was sent home with no treatment. \n\nThe Fracture clinic eventually put my arm in plaster about 2 weeks later but did nothing about my foot which was even worse by this point. As there was no improvement and out of sheer desperation, I then had a private CT scan which confirmed the extent of the breaks. I ended up with both my arm & foot in plaster casts for weeks. \n\nOverall I experienced a terrible service and I would rather travel to a different hospital if I had an emergency now.", "Earlier this year, my sister was admitted to an Ward 5 with a stroke and she was not given a clot buster as part of her treatment.  Approx 3 weeks later, the relatives were offered the opportunity to remove all her treatments including hydration and nutrition. At this stage, they refused the offer. She was not offered speech therapy nor physiotherapy - not even for her affected arm which was becoming very contracted. In late May, a progress meeting was held where it was decided, in my view illegally, that her treatment should be stopped. However, because I queried the legality of this, they checked the Mental Capacity Act and found that it was illegal. In spite of this, the consultant said they would not give her any antibiotics, should she need them. I wrote to the medical director, the chief executive and the consultant requesting a meeting, which they ignored. \n\nInstead soon after, they transferred her to a local Nursing Home where, in my opinion, she was illegally put on the Liverpool Care Pathway. She was not dying and the relatives were not informed until after she was put on the LCP - we were not informed until after she died 15 days later. I feel we were lied to and deceived by the nurses and the medical staff and especially by the doctor I spoke to after my sister's death. I believe she tried to fudge the course of events and muddy the waters by eternally quoting the importance of her \"professional Judgement\". \n\nI am finding it incredibly difficult to come to terms with the loss of my sister but importantly that she died alone, because we were not told that she was put on the LCP. I believe the senior staff at the hospital and all the people who I feel deliberately deceived us at the Nursing Home should be ashamed of their lack of professionalism.  \n\nMy sister was in Airedale Hospital for almost 4 months. She did not have her nails cut and they were long and thick. When I asked if it was possible to cut her nails, I was told by a care assistant that they had to go on a course to learn how to cut nails and anyway they didn't have time. When I next visited her nails were cut but only on one hand and not her toe nails. Her mouth was in a disgraceful state with huge white spots, I wondered whether this was thrush.   I cleaned her mouth when I could, but it was very sore. On the positive side, some of the nurses were lovely and the ward sister was also very supportive, albeit reticent about my sister's care plan. \n\nIn my opinion, PALS was positively useless, as were most of the agencies who purport to be on the patients side. I did not receive any help or useful advice. It is a shambles. This is a short version of what has been a complete nightmare.", "My mother was admitted with cellulitis (a common skin infection).\nShe went into Blackburn Hospital, caught pneumonia. I was told they would not resucitate her if her heart stopped. They administered morphine, this drug interferes with breathing. I believe my mother died as a result.\nThe doctor, when asked, stated well hospitals are the place to contract infections!\nI have several more serious complaints that I will not bore you with.", "I had my prostrate removed 15 months ago at the Western General Hospital and I am as bad as I was when it was done.\nI am totally incontinent and have been relying on pads all this time. I have attended the Western on the odd occasion when they want to see me but nothing has ever been done.\nThey did apologise to me about 3 months ago, saying I had been neglected and it won't happen again. Well I'm sorry, no contact since, my life is in tatters thanks to you the surgery. They told me I would receive any treatment I required. Well let me tell you I have been ignored since this stupid operation.\nAll I want is my life back, to go out without filling pads, not to mention the smell, and as for my sex life its all gone. They have taken this away from me. My relationship is in serious doubt as I have told the surgeon on several occasions, so my only option is to take my complaint to the GMC.", "Dear Relative\r\nI am most concerned to read about the experiences your Mum and other patients on the ward are receiving.

After some blood tests they decided to keep her in. She was taken to SAU ward where the staff were very good. She has dementia, type 2 diabetes and most recently recovered from a ruptured gallbladder.\nOn the Sunday they decided to move her to Ward C4. At 10.30pm I alerted the nurse to the cannula that had come out unfortunately. So her vital glucose fluids were not going in. The nurse just looked at me with apathy and told me that the Dr had to do that. I assumed she meant perhaps the following morning at the latest? !\nI came back at 3pm on the Monday. I had called in the morning to ask about the cannula and fluids (WHY AM I HAVING TO DO THIS BY THE WAY? ).  I was falsely assured that it would be reinserted when the doctors did their rounds.\nSo 3pm, no one has seen my mum, no one has escalated the cannula being out and bag of fluid just sitting there from 10pm previous night. I ask the nurse why the cannula is still out and was told that the doctors suggested that.

Excellent person indeed. The site manager proceeded to reinsert the cannula and get the fluids going again.\nOn Tuesday the Bag of fluid runs out. No Dr has seen my mum. I am forced to go to PALS to complain. Why should I need to do this? A severely dehydrated, diabetic patient with dementia has not been seen in 48 hrs. Disgusting!\nAs for Aramark, do they know some patients have dementia? When you say do you want breakfast and the patient says no, they just cruise on by with not a care in the world. \nThe CEO has a video out saying care and attention must be given to patients and relatives?  I felt that  no one I saw cared about my mum, no one cared about me either.\nIf I had not intervened, I don't know how long my mum would have been left in that ward. 3-4 days?

The attending registrar was helpful and attempted to arrange for me to be treated privately (I have insurance), but this did not happen, partly as my warfarin needed to be neutralised. I was in pain and heavily sedated when I was asked to sign a consent form for surgery and did so without thinking. I was 86 at the time and in spite of a statement during a complaints meeting with management, after a 6 months delay, by the Director of Orthopaedics at the hospital that my injury was\"complex, significant and of severity\", I was operated on by \"the team\" (no names given when I asked) of registrars without any consultant being present. I feel that this may have been an ageist decision by the person who allocated me. I feel the severity of my injury warranted treatment by an experienced consultant. The outcome is that slippage of the wrist has occurred, mobility to turn the wrist has been greatly reduced, nerve damage was so severe that I needed specialised neurosurgery after a carpal tunnel operation proved fruitless (both privately- not at Nortwick Park Hospital) and am still not fully restored some 14 months after the accident.

I had taken him to A&E on the Saturday and again the following day after he rapidly began to lose his eyesight and could barely walk. \n\nAfter a 6. 5 hour wait, he was finally admitted to MEAU and after a day or two had to be moved to SEAU as his bed was needed (I thought at the time it was a strange ward to be admitted to from what appeared to be serious neurological symptoms). He was then left on the ward totally blind and unable to care for himself (relying on his family to help him with eating, toileting and washing) as the SEAU ward, understandably, is too busy a ward to deal with such care). \n\nWhen the doctors came to do their usual rounds, they missed out my husband. When I asked why he wasn't able to see a doctor, I was told he already had a care plan in place and therefore it wasn't necessary. I knew that my husband needed an urgent MRI scan as we had been told in A&E, but I was constantly fobbed off and told there wasn't any available appointments because of the backlog from the bank holiday. \n\nAfter 4 days and at the point of total blindness, I demanded that we see a neurologist (we still hadn't seen one since my husband was admitted). Eventually, after being treated very rudely by one of the doctors, I was told that we could have a 5 minute appointment in the outpatients department the following day, but it would only be 5 minutes because there were no appointments actually available and I would have to take him to the appointment in a wheelchair. I was really cross, but accepted this as our only chance of getting any medical attention (it really was a very frustrating and a surreal situation, that no one seemed at all bothered by a man who obviously had something seriously wrong). \n\nHowever, on the same day, I made an unbelievable discovery. When I went through my husbands hospital notes (a long story I won't bore you with), it became apparent that my husband was being treated as another patient, who (according to the notes) had asked to be admitted to MEAU for observation after being worried about symptoms they were experiencing relating to a headache). The detailed notes in my husband's file had my husband's name and NHS number on, the care plan also had my husbands name on, which stated that the patient be admitted to MEAU for observation and painkillers. However, when I read them I realised that they related to a she and not to my husband at all. My husband had certainly not self admitted for a headache. \n\nI was absolutely furious. My husband had been left on the ward with observation and painkillers (intended for another patient) and left to go blind, for 5 days. When I brought this to the immediate attention of the staff on the ward, suddenly a neurologist from Sheffield was available and came over to Lincoln to see my husband. He was eventually diagnosed with a serious condition and immediate medication was then started. I do not know what would have happened if I had not taken the time to read my husband's notes, (or not in this case) carefully. No one else had done. No one else had noticed that they did not relate to him.\n\nI am still waiting to hear about my formal complaint from Lincoln City Hospital. PALS said, as they have a big back-log of complaints to deal with, they are unable to give me a time limit as to when this can be investigated. It fills me with little confidence. I seriously worry about the safety of other patients. \n\n9 months and 'those at the top' are still unaware of my complaint. It's still stuck in the in tray along with my photographic evidence in the PALS department. (They kindly informed me of this, this morning, after I finally managed to speak to someone).", "Thank you for taking the time to tell us about your experience; we are very sorry that you and your husband clearly had a very difficult and worrying time and on behalf of the Trust I would like to offer both of you our sincere apologies.\nFollowing our response to your initial complaint last year, you came back to us with further thoughts and whilst I was trying to find out a little more about what happened I have been informed that you have recently spoken with one of our senior managers and are arranging a meeting to discuss your concerns face to face.\nI hope this will be helpful for you so that here, locally, the right people can answer your questions and concerns and importantly for us too we can see where we can put things right that did not go well and ensure this does not happen again in the future.", "I suffer from Crohns disease. I have had several surgical procedures due to the disease. My last was in 2009 when I had a permanent ileostomy. I also had a proctectomy. \n\nSome months later my wound had not healed. I complained to the surgeon, who decided to re open the wound and use a vax machine to close it up. This took 4 weeks as an inpatient. \n\nFollowing this, I continued with a open wound, continued feeling ill and continued complaining to the doctor. I was admitted several times and had several scans to be told each time that the scan didn't show anything that was consistent with my pain. I was by this time dependent on morphine and unable to walk. I was bed ridden most days. \n\nI did some research and found a doctor down in London who had experience of Crohns complications. I emailed him and he advised me to contact St Marks for a referral there. In the meantime I was admitted again. This time my surgeon was away, so a different member of his team sent me for a tummy scan. When I came back to the ward, I asked what was shown. I was advised it had shown some fluid pockets. I was also seen by a gynaecologist who told me I had a small ovarian cyst conclusive with that of a menstrual cycle. (I did advise him that I hadn't had any for some time). \n\nOn the return of my own surgeon, he sent me to radiology to have these pockets drained with needles. This was a very invasive procedure which gave me little relief but the strange thing was the radiologist actually said to me 'do you realise how big these pockets were?' He described them as large oranges (several of them). By this time I was not getting any better and had a fraught out patients appointment to see my surgeon. I insisted on a second opinion. He said he would refer me to his friend in Birmingham. He also stated that he had only seen one case like this, so he was unsure on doing surgery. When I asked what had happened to the other person, he said she went and never came back. So he didn't know. He was still pretty sure my pain wasn't conclusive with the scan. After a further admittance for pain, he came to me and said he might send me to Oxford for a second opinion. I agreed. \n\nI went to see the doctor in Oxford, who took one look at my scan and stated he can fix me. I was put on an urgent list and had surgery within weeks. The surgery took seven hours and was a dual surgical procedure with a bowel doctor and a professor of gynaecology. After the surgery, I was advised there were several masses, a chronic infection and I had to have a hysterectomy and a opphorectomy (ovaries removed). The biopsy report showed several masses that needed to be tested for malignancy, All were benign. My fallopian tubes were unrecognisable and the the surgeon stated he was amazed how I had managed with this inside. \n\nIf it had been left to New Cross, I dread to think where I would be today.", "Dear Elsa,\r\nWe at the Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust have great sympathy for the complications that you have experienced from your disease and from the surgery.\r\nWe responded promptly to your complaint through our complaints process and were advised that the Parliamentary Health Service Ombudsman has also reviewed your complaint.

We are pleased you were happy about the outcome of your treatment and we hope you continue to improve.", "My complaints are with regard to a number of issues that came to my attention when my Mum was recently admitted to the Countess of Chester Hospital and eventually died and concern the poor standard of basic care that the staff provided for her in the last week of her life. I hope you could investigate the matters raised.\nMy Mum had been suffering from cervical cancer for four years but was admitted to the hospital in March 2010 and diagnosed with bronchial pneumonia aswell. In the night, 2 days after she was admitted Mum was transferred to Ward 51, in a single bedroom. \nUpon entering the room I noticed it was very cold and the window was open. I shut the window and put my hand on the radiator and realised the radiator was not working. I reported this to the porter who had bought Mum to the room. He in turn told either the ward sister or staff nurse who confirmed there was a problem with the radiator and in turn tried to contact the maintenance department to affect a repair. I was then told that no one from maintenance could attend until the morning and my Mum was given an extra sheet to keep her warm. Do you think this is the correct procedure for an elderly woman who has been diagnosed with bronchial pneumonia? \nThe hospital Trust's response to this complaint is that an \u201caction plan\u201d has now been prepared. Surely an \u201caction plan\u201d does not have to be written for something as basic as this? And if it does it should have been written when the hospital was initially opened and the question needs to be asked, did not the medical staff realise that a cold room is not an appropriate place for an elderly patient with bronchial pneumonia, or is this the first case of bronchial pneumonia that staff at the hospital had dealt with? \nI put it to you that even someone who has no medical knowledge at all would know that this is not good practice and would not need an \u201caction plan\u201d to inform them of such basic care!\nOn the same day I returned to visit my Mum with other members of the family. After we had been there approximately 2 hours I realised that my Mum had not been changed. Bearing in mind that Mum had been suffering from cervical cancer with the associated blood losses for four years and now in the last week of her life was doubly incontinent. I drew this to the attention of a member of staff and was told Mum would be changed \u201cin a minute\u201d. This was a standard reply to almost anything I asked a member of staff during the week my Mum was in hospital. My Mum had to wait a further 4 hours to be changed. The effect that this had was to make her feel uncomfortable and gave her lack of dignity. This was predictable and preventable. The attitude that was portrayed to me from a lot (but not all) of the staff was the staff were trying to run a hospital and could not be inconvenienced with looking after elderly dying patients.\nThe Trust's response to this complaint is that it has produced an \u201caction plan to remind staff of the importance of monitoring and changing patients. \u201d My response to this is, surely an action plan has already been produced to inform staff of how to clean patients or is this first patient they have needed to clean since the hospital opened?\nAlso whilst my Mum was in hospital \u00a320.00 was taken out of her handbag (which was in a zipped holdall) and lost by a member of staff and I was told that the money had been put in a safe for safe keeping but no receipt was ever issued. Mum was also aware that the money had been taken and until she lost consciousness kept asking me to make sure that the money was returned but because Mum was gravely ill this was the last thing on my mind. However when Mum died my daughter asked the nursing staff for the money to be returned. The money however was never located and I made an official complaint but despite a thorough internal investigation, was never found and the member of staff who took it never owned up to this. \nHowever a few months after my mum had died, I received a cheque with a letter of apology from the legal services department. In this instance it is not about the money but the principle of what happened.\nOther instances of this kind of behaviour occurred during my Mum's brief stay in hospital, concerning her tablets not being given in the correct sequence and a barrier cream to alleviate soreness of her cervical tumour (which had been specifically prescribed by my Mum's consultant prior to her admittance). The doctor in charge was also ill informed as to some of my Mum's medication as some of her medication was not even listed on her medical notes which I can only assume is yet another act of poor attention to detail. When I informed the ward doctor I was told this medication was not on her notes and to found out what the missing medication was called myself. Surely this is the job of the doctor! They then told me bluntly, that my Mum would probably be dead by the end of the week! I then had to remind the doctor that this lady that she showed little regard for was my Mother and that she should be treated with a little more respect and dignity. \nEventually after making a number of telephone calls I found the name of the barrier cream myself and informed the doctor who instructed ward staff to apply it. Unfortunately the staff were untrained as how to use this cream or for what it was for and started to apply the cream to dry skin on my Mum's feet and it was only as a result of my Mum informing the staff that it was applied to the cervical tumour.\nI also observed other elderly patients who could not manage to eat or drink for themselves not being fed by the nursing staff and it is my belief that if you cannot feed yourself in hospital you will starve. In the last couple of days of my Mum's life when she could no longer drink properly we noticed that her lips were completely dry due to the fact that the staff were not even moistening them. Fortunately we visited and stayed with her for about 12 hours a day but on our return it was obvious they had not been moistened.\nI had an unbiased opinion of the NHS and this hospital until I witnessed first hand the events I have mentioned in this letter and am now extremely disappointed and concerned with the attitude and care that some of the staff and hospital provide.\nI fully understand that everyone dies and when a close relative dies it is going to be upsetting but the staff showed little or no compassion to the situation and I had to point out to the doctor that it may be a run of the mill situation for her to have a patient die but to me it was the worst thing that could possibly happen and my life would never be the same again. The attitude that came across was why invest time and money on an elderly patient who is terminally ill.\nOn a separate occasion last August I had course to attend the hospital in association with my job. It was on this occasion whilst in the assessment area that I came across another incident of poor care to an elderly patient. For three hours myself and my colleague heard an elderly female patient asking for help desperately from a nurse. \nShe repeated this over and over again. I opened the door of the cubicle where we where and I had clear vision of the cubicle where the elderly female patient was calling for help. During the three hour period I saw a nurse go into the cubicle and tell the elderly patient sternly to be quiet and that she was going to shut the cubicle door as she was disturbing the other patients. The nurse then shut the door on this patient and I heard her say to other member of staff that the patient was annoying her. The other members of staff simply ignored this patient completely. \nIn my opinion all this elderly confused patient wanted was someone to hold her hand for a moment and reassure her everything was alright. Again this is another instance were someone like a nurse who is supposed to be of a caring disposition showed no caring or compassion. I wrote a separate letter of complaint over this matter having made a note of the patient's name and gave a description of the nurse involved.\nI have written to the complaints department of the hospital, the Chief Executive and the Parliamentary Health Service Ombudsman as to my observations and complaints and have asked as to what action has been taken against the staff and requested that disciplinary action be taken against the members of staff that were, in my opinion, negligent, and have written documentary evidence of the replies but I feel that nothing will be done other than for them to apologise for the bad practices that were carried out. \nDespite a request the Trust will not inform me if they have taken any disciplinary action. The bad practice and treatment of the elderly at this hospital that I witnessed (and other hospitals) needs exposing so that members of the public know what to expect when family and friends are admitted to hospital. I have also written to the hospital and asked them under The Freedom of Information Act as to how many complaints they have received regarding the lack of basic care of patients from 1st January 2007 until 23rd June 2010 to which they replied 141. I believe I have only just scratched the surface as to what is going on in this hospital and am now at a loss as to where to turn for assistance in this matter.\nIf you wish to discuss this matter further with me, I would encourage you to contact me.", "I was working at the hospital and it was when I fainted I decided to admit myself to the A&E department. I had a vague idea of what it was that was wrong but wanted a second opinion and diagnosis. It was in the A&E waiting room that my condition took an unfortunate turn and I collapsed for a second time. I was moved to a bed in 'see and treat' or otherwise known as 'minors' as at that point that's where there was a bed for me to lie down. In there, I had no observations taken or anybody come to see if I was OK. Fortunately, my husband is a doctor (in a different department) and came to see me as soon as he could. He was horrified that I was in that room with the curtain closed for 4 hours before anybody came to see me. Even then, that was due to the cleaner telling an SHO I looked in a bit of pain. I'd like to say this was the end of the story but unfortunately it got worse. I was then seen by a Jr Doctor who quickly examined me telling me 'I'd better be quick otherwise we'll breach with you'. Unfortunately, that doctor missed every crucial examination on me and discharged me home very poorly. I then went home and was rushed to hospital (a different one requested by my husband) with septicaemia of Pyelonephritis. I was then on HDU for four days with a questionable kidney transplant.\r\nI am well and recovered now and I cannot thank the staff enough at the second hospital I went too. They were diligent and caring. Unfortunately, in an environment like A&E you are sometimes seen as a 'number' and not a patient. The care is very rushed and as a patient you can feel like you are not being listened too as staff are too concerned with time breaches and bed spaces.\r\nOn the whole, I love the NHS and the work they do but on the odd occasion have felt very let down by poor systems and care in place.\r\nThank you", "Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback on your experience at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham.\r\nWe welcome all feedback and would like to assure you that all comments are taken seriously and acted upon as part of our ongoing commitment to improving patient experience.\r\nWe are very concerned to hear about your experience whilst being treated in our Emergency Department.

They did not call the number on the card, although it was in the middle of the day to get advice. The doctor saw him for a maximum of 2 minutes.\nHe died one and half hours later at home.

I was 19 and collapsed at 4am in agony, throwing up everywhere, and passing out. The paramedics found me on the floor covered in sick and one kept telling me there was nothing wrong with me, that I was being a baby, and that he didn't want to take me to hospital even after I insisted. Then he sat with me in the ambulance for 30 minutes stationary telling me I shouldn't go. \n\nWhen I got to the hospital I was left with no answers, absolutely terrified. Then I heard doctors and nurses outside talking about an Ectopic pregnancy which scared me more but no one would speak to me. An insensitive doctor then came into me and said 'Oh by the way, did you know that you are pregnant? And we think it's Ectopic'. I didn't even know I was pregnant and luckily knew what an Ectopic pregnancy was because no one explained it to me. While I was still in shock he left again without waiting for an answer. \n\nBriefly I will explain what happened in the next few days; I had to wait 6 hours for any sort of painkiller and I was in agony. Luckily I have a high pain threshold yet I was still writhing in the bed. I remember the two nurses that were nice very well because I felt every one else was vile to me. No one realised I had massive blood loss from rupture to the point of passing out frequently until after my operation and then they said there was no point doing anything about it now. They left a piece of bag in me during the operation which they can't find. I needed a wheelchair to get to the toilet but then while I was in there they took it away and I had to get back myself while passing out. I didn't have a buzzer and had to disturb others when I needed help. They kept forgetting for hours to change my drip. They told me they were monitoring my urine but they weren't, and before my scan they kept telling me I was making it up and looking for attention. Then after my operation they told me to go home without any money in the middle of the night, without any explanation as to why it happened. \n\nI still want to know why they think I had an Ectopic pregnancy, because beforehand they were saying I was so healthy they didn't understand it, and after the operation I was told nothing. Now I'm scared that whatever was wrong with my left tube is wrong with my right, but I was told nothing. I have been to this hospital again about agonising shoulder pain (which I had when I was pregnant) and they have told me I am imagining it and am being stupid. This experience will stay with me always. I'm so fed up of this hospital I will never go again, and recommend it to no one.", "This is a long & ongoing saga and almost a comedy of errors & negligent care of my mother by both the GP & hospital trusts....\nInitially for a few years now since being diagnosed as diabetic my mothers weight had constantly & slowly been reducing & this had been noted at the GP surgery.  At no time was there a suggestion that perhaps she should visit a dietician to find out why.    Now taking the saga on to Autumn 2012 .... she has suffered from catarrh for some considerable time....but this had started to become very dark & green & infected .... so went to the GP for help, only to be told it was nothing & they offered no treatment.\n\nFlash forward to late 2012 & my Mother was feeling very poorly indeed...weak, tired & having difficulty breathing. She visited her GP & without even being examined by the GP she was told there was nothing wrong & to go home.\n\nThe next morning she was very ill & her blood glucose level spiked to 32 so my father called an ambulance & she was rushed into & admitted to Intensive Care at Scunthorpe General Hospital with pneumonia & what at the time they thought may have been a stroke.  A separate formal complaint has been sent to the GP & PALS about this treatment by the GP.\n\nAfter a couple of weeks in ICU they determined that she had not had a stroke & was receiving excellent care but due to a staffing/bed shortage she was transferred to ICU at Hull Royal Infirmary.  This caused a great many problems with my elderly father being unable to visit at Hull due to his own health problems & issues with driving at night.  We worked round those problems by temporarily moving him in with my sister who lived nearer Hull & one person taking him to Hull while someone else would pick him up 6 hours later. We actually spoke to PALS & both our & her MP's about this at the time.\n\nWhile in Hull (again receiving excellent care) she contracted another chest infection, but doctors also looked into other medical problems & carried out many tests & although tests showed negative they started treatment for myasthenia gravis.  Now the chest infection appeared to have masked the results but she did start to improve.\nLast month she was transferred back to ICU at Scunthorpe & continued to improve & about a week later was moved to Ward 22 .\nNow the errors & neglect really started.   Her nasal feeding tube was removed & the staff told her they were going to remove her tracheotomy tube either that day or the next which perked her up no end.  From that point she was receiving no nutrition as she was still being treated as Nil by Mouth. Come the next morning morning the Doctor did his rounds & told her that he was not willing to remove the tube at this time & that the feeding tube would need to be replaced.   This distressed her & she said she did not want that tube back in but after being lectured by family members she agreed.   The tube was not put back in.   Come the following day (so now 72 hours without nutrition) the tube was still not back in & when I questioned the nurses they said it was because she had refused it.   We know that after that initial refusal she had agreed (so I pointed this out & demanded they put it back).  Eventually three days after removal the tube was reinserted & around 96 hours after being removed, feeding by the tube was restarted.  However it does not appear that anyone has been checking her blood glucose levels during this time (not feeding a diabetic patient for 4 days).  It was also not clear if she was receiving any insulin after having been on pumped in insulin for 8 weeks in ICU & also not clear if she had been receiving her medication for the hypertension which she also suffers from.\n\nTo top all this off, it also appears that since being transferred from Hull Royal Infirmary (where the doctors told us they were still convinced that she was suffering from myasthenia gravis & that the medication was the reason for her improvement) that this treatment had not been continued at Scunthorpe! \n\nWe are sure looking at the decline in her health over a 72 hour period that the staff were negligent & were leaving her there to slip into a coma & die.\n\nA couple of days after having the feeding tube replaced they removed the tracheotomy & tube & have put my mum onto a regular diet.   Doctor visited & said they was very pleased with her progress & that the hope now was to start intensive rehab & physio to get her fit to return home which she was pleased about. Her chest infections have all cleared up but in my opinion the nursing care still leaves a bit to be desired.  For example, as she is on a respiratory ward & not in need of great amounts of nursing care we feel she is largely ignored.   On the first day of being put in a chair beside her bed, she leaned forward & fell onto the floor.  She was there for almost half an hour before someone came to assist her back into the chair.\nUntil now she has received no rehab (8 days after being told this would start).\nOn the whole my mothers care has been a comedy of errors and while we cannot praise the staff in either the Hull or Scunthorpe ICU depts enough, care beyond that has been laughable & as we said we consider bordering on gross negligence.  Senior nursing staff on Ward 22 are at best aloof,  worst rude & tell the family absolutely nothing despite promises of daily updates.\nThe whole situation has also been reported to the hospital through my mum's MP.....but as yet over 2 weeks after he wrote....he has not yet received a reply.\n\n\n\n", "Thank you very much for your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear about your experience. I can confirm we have received this complaint and will be responding very soon. In the meantime, you are very welcome to request a meeting with Trust staff if you would like to discuss your concerns in person.\r\nKind regards,\r\nSarah Mainprize", "My mother was badly neglected by her gp, when she finally got through to the GP that her right hip was so painful and she was unable to walk, the gp reluctantly agreed to send her for a x-ray. \n\nThe consultant was shocked by what he had found and it was put down to neglect.   My mother was so pleased \"at last someone was believing her\" but after months of going back and forward, the hospital too began to neglect her. She has sadly lost her fight for life now. I know, and I'm sure that all the stress of both gp and hospital neglect helped towards this (2yrs). \n\nI think they used her blood pressure as an excuse to keep cancelling the operation. Cross is not the word I'd use. If there was a problem with her blood pressure, this should have been looked into properly, surely? Why treat people like this? It's disgraceful and I did get into it with the NHS long before she died. They said they would look into it and get back to me. I'm still awaiting a reply.   I want this kind of treatment to stop.

What I wanted more than anything else was to TALK to somebody professional and to actually get to the root of the problem rather than merely be a drug receptacle and be monitored.\nThe staff I encountered were very much unavailable and spent a lot of time in the office 'doing handover' and the staff on the desk, although very pleasant seemed to be mainly there to chase escapees and fill in charts of what patients have eaten and when they slept. \nI felt pretty much on my own at a time when I have never felt more vulnerable, frightened and anxious. Other patients may have severe psychotic illnessess with quite bizarre behaviour, but staff do not seem to monitor this or provide duty of care to others on the ward. \nWard rounds are positively medieval and totally demeaning whereby the patient is paraded ( a bit like a Victorian freak show } in front of an audience of social workers and associated professional workers as if to demonstrate just how mad they are. I personally found ward rounds the most anxiety provoking demeaning experience of my whole stay. \nI also experienced abuse on this ward. I had leave out and went for a coffee with a fellow inmate to the hospital coffee shop just to escape the eternal boredom on the ward. I overstayed my leave time and on return to the ward I was alcohol tested. It proved, according to the staff member, to be positive for alcohol and no other member of staff monitored the testing. I know I had only had coffee and the only logical answer is the member of staff fixed the result. I was told I was not allowed any more time off the ward and I was to remain locked up 24/7 if I wished to stay. I protested and asked for a blood test as I knew I could prove I had not been drinking but I was told to keep quiet by other staff. I am happy to name the member of staff who did this to me. I am totally shocked that this happened in the NHS whilst treating an extremely vulnerable person. This person had the power to restrict my freedom and did so without impunity. Even worse, I was told by them that if I didn't like it I should leave and they pushed the forms in my face for me to sign. I was tempted but I knew if I left I would probably have attempted suicide.\n\nTo sum up psychiatric care at the Brandon Unit, I felt it was woefully inadequate. There are some very good members of staff but I felt the majority spent most of their time dishing out medication and filling in charts and avoiding communication with patients. We are treated as if we are troublemakers if we protest or question our diagnosis. Of course we are mentally ill and are not capable of having an opinion and that means that everything can be swept under the carpet. \nEventually after years of admissions to the Brandon Unit I went into rehabilitation treatment for alcohol problems and through counselling developed a greater understanding of my underlying problems. This has led to a full recovery from depression and alcohol problems. Why on earth couldn't the Brandon Unit achieve this? Not once did anyone ever take the time to get to the root of the problem.\nIt's my opinion that the whole culture of psychiatric care needs to change. Of course drugs are vital but there needs to be a more person centered holistic approach which meets the needs of the patients. I know that time spent talking with patients is costly, however that is what I needed most to sort out my problems which led to depression anxiety and drinking.", "May we first of all offer our sincere condolences for the loss of your mother.\r\nWe are extremely saddened to read that you feel your mother had such a poor experience with us.

My GP sent me to Epsom Hospital to have the X-rays done. I found out there that \"there is nothing wrong with it\" and I was recommended to take painkillers. They didn't help, so I was sent to a physiotherapist for 6 treatment sessions. I followed every instruction the physiotherapist told me but it didn't have any good result at all so I ended up back at my GP. He didn't know what to do so I was given a steroid injection which made this pain even worse and I was unable to move my whole arm for at least 24 hours. \n\nWhen my GP found out this didn't help, he told me to keep taking painkillers and I was told I'd be sent a letter with an appointment for a Shoulder clinic. I got this letter six weeks after this with an appointment made for another six weeks from this date. I decided to try a chiropractor, where I had to pay \u00a339 per 20 mins session and also decided to have the shoulder checked abroad where I had to pay for it. It took the doctor abroad 5  minutes to find out what's wrong with it by using an ultrasound. He found out that one of the nerves is partially torn in two places and that an operation is necessary. \n\nI came back to the UK, asked my GP to send me to the ultrasound, which he did and they found out the same. The doctor who did the ultrasound in Epsom Hospital was very surprised that my GP hadn't sent me there in the first place. Apparently that was what he was supposed to do when the X-rays didn't show anything. This means that I was given a steroid injection that could have possibly made my shoulder problem even worse. I was also told that my GP shouldn't have done so without knowing what was wrong with my shoulder. I am very disappointed with this situation. I believe that the reason why he didn't treat me the way he was supposed to is mainly because I'm not English. \n\nI'm really having big problems with my shoulder at the moment and it's getting worse. I'm only 23 and if this is not treated properly, I could have problems for the rest of my life. If he had treated me the way he should have, I could have had my shoulder fixed already. It is absolutely unacceptable to leave it like this. The only thing he was supposed to do is send me to the ultrasound. I felt he was almost laughing at me every time I came to his surgery. I spent a lot of money just to find out what's wrong with it and I think I should get it back. The worst thing about all of this is the injection I didn't have to be given that might have made it all worse. Doctors shouldn't work for the NHS if they don't want to help people.", "Last year I had my Gall Bladder removed using keyhole surgery - all appeared to go well, but two days later I was delivered by ambulance to Glasgow Western A&E. \nI was admitted to a ward and many tests were done over the next day where it was found that bile was leaking into my stomach. Having found the problem swiftly the surgeon had me nil by mouth every night for a week on the promise that the next morning I was to be taken back to surgery to have the leak fixed - it  never happened. On the morning round where I broke down in tears when the surgeon told me they wanted to \u00a8wait and see for another day\u00a8.  I felt the surgeon was extremely short with me and told me this was the way it was so keep taking the morphine.\nI wish I could have kept taking the morphine, as this surgeon\u00b4s lack of bedside manner became wholly irrelevant when a new shift of nursing staff came on the ward. By this time, and with a stomach full of very painful acid, I could barely walk, it would take me two hours to hobble to the loo, you could ring the buzzer all day if you liked as no-one came - ever. When they made their rounds I would beg for the morphine only to be told that they were too busy to have two nurses running off to get the drugs for me and anyway I would become addicted then never get home. \nThank God for the night shift as they would come in and I would at last get some pain relief. \nThe lack of care I think can be summed up by the nurse who had to be brought to me by another patient (as answering buzzers did not happen- ever) when she saw that I had collapsed in the shower she was disgusted that I was lying naked, asked why I had not covered myself up (was unable to move) and threw a towel at me and left never to reappear. Thankfully two elderly patients realised she was not coming back and came to help me up.\nThankfully the story ends better as my surgeon went on holiday, the new one came round for the handover and was shocked that no-one had operated as waiting and seeing was only serving to have more acid pour into my stomach. \nI was on his operating table a few hours later and sent over to Gartnaval Hospital the next morning where I received all pain relief, nurses were shocked that I had lost over a stone and a half in weight in a week and that no nurse from the Western had put in my notes that I had not eaten all week (remember the fasting every day? ). \nThis ended as a three week nightmare with a toddler and baby at home not knowing when Mummy was coming home. A\nI am embarrassed by how I was treated as normally I would never allow this, but in so much pain you are at their mercy.\nI could not fault the care of the nurses at Gartnaval, everyone from surgeon to cleaner had time to talk to you and help, however I would not leave a rat in the \u00a8care\u00a8 of the staff I came into contact with at the Western and every other hospital in Scotland would have to be shut before I would allow myself or anyone in my care to be admitted there.", "My experience with the NHS was pretty poor.\nHaving experienced abdominal pain and fever over a weekend, and it not having eased on Monday, I called NHS-24 At about 11pm on a monday night. They told me to immediately attend GEMS (out of hours service) at my local hospital where I was seen by a doctor who diganosed a possible appendicitis. The hospital where GEMS is located is non-surgical so the Dr sent me immediately to glasgow's flagship hospital, Glasgow Royal Infirmary (GRI). He gave me a letter to hand in saying I needed priority assessment and also phoned the receiving surgeon at GRI and asked them to see me immediately. \nOn arrival to GRI the reception staff took some details and asked me to wait in the waiting area. This was now about 12: 15AM on Tuesday morning. About 1 hour later I was seen by a triage nurse, who did not examine my abdomen at all, just took my temperature and blood pressure and sent me back to the waiting are. \nAfter a further 2 hours in the waiting area I was getting weaker and weaker and my pain was steadily getting worse and worse. At about 3am I asked my wife to go see what was happening as I could no longer sit, I was about to pass out and needed somewhere to lie down. They told me I'd be seen soon. \nAbout 3: 15am I was called through to A&E and put on a trolley. A nurse took my obs and also took a blood sample. I did not see a doctor at that point. No one examined my abdomen. I was literally rolling in pain on the trolley and no one came toassess me. At about 6am a trainee nurse came to take my obs again and we begged her to find a doctor so I could be seen. (We were also told we needed another blood sample because the first one had not been analysed and had 'gone off'. ) The nurse literally grabbed a Doctor by the elbow and brought them to me.  Appendicitis was diagnosed and an emergency theatre slot booked.  I was prescribed Morphine for pain release. At about 8AM I was given more morphine and was told I'd be going to theatre soon. About 10am a bed became available on a ward and instead of going to theatre I was sent there. A doctor on the ward cancelled the theatre slot and and refused to give me any further pain relief until I'd been seen by the consultant. We were told we'd just have to wait. I was in the most unimaginable pain, struggling to stay conscious and just wanted to die by this point. I told my wife I couldn't take any more and wanted to slip away. She insisted that the doctor do something NOW due to the condition I was in. She knows me well and could see I was fading fast. Reluctantly the doctor contacted the consultant who again diagnosed either appendicitis, peritonitis or a ruptured bowel. \nI was in such a state that he gave me an immediate morphine shot in the arm and sent me to theatre as an emergency. It took the NHS over 11 hours from first presenting to them with abdominal pains to being properly diagnosed. 10 hours in the GRI before being seen by the person who had any authority to do anything. 7 Hours on a trolley with no pain relief. I can tell you without any exaggeration that I got to theatre with no time to spare. What was supposed to be a 45 Minute operation to remove appendix with laparoscopy took over 4 hours due to complications in surgery. We believe this was because the appendix had ruptured and spilled in the abdominal cavity and also due to the advanced gangrenous state of the appendix.\nPost-surgery the care from the nurses and ward staff was fantastic - they could not have been better.\n* It should not have taken 11 hours to have been given a diagnosis.\n* The first blood sample should have been analysed and that would have shown the seriousness of my condition.\n* The diagnosis of the Doctor at GEMS and the Dcotor in A&E were not believed and ignored.\n* The priority letter from the doctor at GEMS was ignored.\n* The first blood sample was ignored.\nI believe a huge contributing factor was the use of the 'NEWS SCORE' as a means of assessment. If like me you are normally strong and fit and can put a fight against pain then the NEWS SCORE will let you down. You can easily be at deaths door and still get a NEWS SCORE of only 0 or 1\nI believe GRI has a policy of not letting you see a surgeon until a bed is available. \nPost-op I developed a wound infection and had to be re-admitted. Again I was left in A&E from 12: 15PM till after 6PM before anyone had even looked at the wound. This is not acceptable.", "My daughter was due to have an operation. We have to travel many miles, using the ambulance taxi service to get to Manchester.\nDespite this, outpatient appointments, the operation itself, and follow ups were/are frequently cancelled at the last minute leading to a huge amount or reorganising of taxis, hotels and my full time employment, where leave must be taken and my own patients cancelled. \nAn apology, in our experience, seems to be impossible at this hospital and from what we've seen - one department does not talk to another; the medical secretaries we've encountered have been especially arrogant and rude. \nIt transpires the diagnosis was a hypothesis rather than a 'fact' and surgery was not in fact required as..it is hypothesised AFTER surgery...the condition had corrected itself before surgery! My daughter's surgery was therefore unnecessary and we were not told this was even a possibility, let alone been given any alternative options to surgery. \nWe were presented with 'facts' that were based on a radiology report on an apparently vague and unreliable scan...we were therefore completely misinformed and not given a chance to make an informed choice. \nSurgery would NOT have been an option had we been given the correct information we'd been asking for. My child has now got to recover, with two large scars, from an unnecessary operation. \nWe found the bank nurse assigned to us was incompetent; they repeatedly read the medication chart wrong giving the excuse that they'd 'forgotten their glasses etc', took us to x4 operating theatres by mistake, had to be told they needed to go to recovery with me, disappeared while my daughter was in theatre for 3-4 hours rather than the expected one hour - during which no information other than, 2 hours later, 'there are complications'. \nThis was traumatising and my daughter woke up in sheer terror, with a sky high temperature, in extreme pain. The consultant, refused to allow me to see the notes - I had to make a written data protection act request which I gave to the nurse at the time, and again requested via email - despite strict legal timescales I have still not received these. \nThe doctor spoke to us and agreed that further scans before an operation would have been prudent but did not happen. They agreed to see us at a Saturday clinic as we are now needing to take unpaid leave due to staying in hospital far longer than we were told was needed. The medical secretary has now said we cannot have this as the doctor only does appointments at certain times in the week. This is despite the fact the entire conversation was heard by her father and grandfather, a retired GP, as I told the doctor I was on the phone to them at the time and they wanted to hear what had occurred. \nWe are still waiting for an appointment (the follow up was in any case cancelled by RMCH for unrelated reasons). We had no follow up or discharge information on the type of stitches, wound care, when to resume school etc. We waited 9 hours for staff to give simple medication and call the ambulance taxi (never any problem when called by the patient directly so I can only assume it was due to a problem with RMCH staff). \nThe health visitor here was upset as they only got an answerphone referral asking them to do a follow up on a Sunday (when they don't work). We were finally called back recently (for a Sunday appointment) by the Medical Secretary who made no reference to the fact that we had been promised a Saturday follow up and have witnesses to that and talking over me to rebook a Wednesday appointment. \nThe communication, and care itself here, has been appalling and utterly disrespectful in our experience. It has been, and continues to be, a traumatic and unnecessary ordeal. We no longer trust that, when an appointment is given or solution offered, RMCH staff will honour it. \nI wish for explanations in writing first and foremost to ensure our daughter is WELL (and that I can actually get to my own work around the shambles of RMCH cancelling and not honouring appointments). \nI find it hard to believe that an NHS trust, and it's staff, can operate in such a shockingly disorganised, disrespectful and lax clinical manner.", "We are very sorry to receive your comments and concerns via the Patient Opinion website about your experiences at RMCH.\r\nIt is very difficult to respond to the specific concerns you have raised without being able to investigate in detail.

I recently have come down with a really bad episode of depression and suicide thoughts.\nThe suicide thoughts have become extremely difficult to control, I have been to the GP numerous times in the last 3 months, trying to get hold of help. In the last 3 months I have been in contact with the crisis team twice, both times expressing very strongly that I feel as bad as I do with suicide thoughts. They are aware that I have the means and a plan to attempt suicide. Both times they have let me walk away feeling as bad as I do. Last time I was told that it would be a shame as I'm only young....I felt extremely patronised and left very angry and upset that my cries for help were so clearly being ignored.\nI am now at a stage where I am struggling greatly on a daily basis, but fear using the systems we have in place as I feel again I would be ignored, and to be sent away again, with a sentence as patronising as that again, I wouldn't be able to cope with.\nI am extremely disappointed with the mental health services that are available in my area. Even the mental health worker I have been referred to can't do regular appointments. This is an illness that is exceptionally difficult to handle at the best of times, but it feels like the mental health services have the same stigmas attached with then as everyone else.\nI need help, I've admitted that, I have struggled to accept and admit I need help, but now I am, it feels like I'm taking 1 step forward and 5 steps back. what more help can I get?", "My son came to your hospital twice. He was told he had no broken ribs twice. he passed away 4 days after this. I feel your care is an utter mess and that this hospital needs a good shake up. I heard people moaning about their dinner when my son was fighting for his life. I believe the care was appalling. ", "The whole experience has been a nightmare. I have been left in debilitating pain since donating one of my kidneys. Doctors who I have seen have later denied seeing me.\nI feel I have been lied to, passed a copy of MIMS to point out a drug that I would like prescribed - it almost felt like abuse. I cannot work anymore and have to fight for every penny provided to be able to live.\nMy husband is doing very well but should I be left like this? I have a copy of my medical records so I do know what has been done to me. ", "My partner had a colonoscopy and was sent to stepping hill after rectal bleeding. This showed no problems and we felt very fortunate. This story is to encourage patients to not accept no further investigation. He had bowel cancer that was further up than a colonoscopy shows and we did not know this. Nobody including his GP asked him about family history which there is and a scan would have shown a sizeable tumour which had spread upwards in the year following his all clear. If we had known, we would have had a private scan as we have done before and there would be no need for this story. Bottom line is you have to arrange things for yourself. Please don't rely on hospital diagnosis or GPs. We have lost a special person. Don't be the next.", "My mother was admitted at the end of November 2012 with acute pancreatitis caused by gall stones. In her late 70s and in good health with excellent mobility, she deteriorated quickly in my opinion due to staff not wanting to administer drugs through iv or injection. They were adamant my mother was 'refusing' medicines but all she was saying was that they made her gag, then vomit, making the drug useless. It took a stand up argument by myself to get them to administer drugs alternately which is ridiculous. \nI was with my mother when she became 'septic' and went into shock. A student nurse kept insisting my mother was fine, just a bit cold. Again I had to go and find a senior nurse myself who immediately called for a consultant and mum spent weeks in critical care, who were wonderful I must say. \nWhen mum was eventually sent back to a normal ward, once again I felt the treatment was appalling. She was bed bound and her drinking water and glass were left well out of her reach as was the buzzer for her to call for assistance.\nAs she was in a side room, no one would have known if she required urgent attention. Faeces were left on the floor along with discarded medical items and packaging. I spent most of visiting time cleaning up the room. The television only worked on two occasions during the 3 months mum spent in hospital meaning that she became very withdrawn due to no stimulation. \nSome nurses were helpful but most of the ones I met would not offer any help or time to explain any of the procedures that were done. On many occasions, mum was told she could come home only for another member of staff to say she couldn't come home. Some nurses were heard gossiping between themselves while relatives were left to wait for assistance and queued up to ask about their relatives.\nA care package was 'organised' by physio but the day before mum was discharged, we were told she would not need one even though she could not walk unaided or get up from the bed herself. When mum returned home, we were constantly at her home because of her lack of mobility. \nIn my opinion, this is an appalling hospital with no idea of how to treat patients like human beings. I pray I never have to be hospitalised there.\n", "My daughter was referred to the Opthalmic Department at Warrington General Hospital by her optician in August 2012 and received an appointment to see a specialist in October. We arrived early for this appointment and had to wait a very long time before being called in to have an eye test.\nWe then had to wait in a different area until being called in by a junior doctor who carried out an examination, tested her eye pressure etc but stated that she could not tell us anything and that we would have to see a senior doctor. We then had to go back out and wait to be called. After a period of time we were called in, the senior doctor carried out a further examination and then said I want my boss to have a look at you and sent a Junior Doctor to fetch this specialist.\nBy this time it was approaching 3hrs since our appointment time, when eventually the specialist (the person we had been told originally that our appointment was with) came into the room, carrying various things including a newspaper and wearing a coat and outside garments. They never acknowledged that either of us were in the room just spoke to the senior doctor. They then slammed the paper on the desk, removed their coat and said they would take a look.\nThe examination lasted less than 30 seconds and made both of us feel like we were an inconvenience. They then mumbled something to the senior doctor, marked a sheet and picked up their stuff and left.  They appeared to be in a hurry to leave and we were both of the opinion that the senior doctor was taken aback by his actions, I don't think they knew what to say at that point. I asked what happens now and the senior doctor said that my daughter needed further tests and that the optician was correct about the swelling at the back of the eyes. They passed us a form and told us to hand it in at reception, which was closed. Only cleaners were present so we posted the form in a box at reception.\nA follow up appointment was received for December. My daughter rang the hospital to request an earlier appointment as she didn't want to feel that the appointment would be rushed or stop anyone from being able to go home on time. She was told that the next available appointment was late January 2013, therefore she decided to keep the original appointment offered. Once again we arrived early, prior to the appointment time, and she was called in after only 5 minutes. She had an eye test and was told to sit in the waiting area. After another 10 minutes we were called and taken down the corridor for a field test which took about 30 minutes. We were then told to sit and wait in the corridor. We seemed to be waiting around 45 minutes before a member of staff came into the corridor (a public area) and proceeded to ask my daughter personal questions. They then went back into the room. About 30 minutes later, during which other staff approached and stated 'it won't be long' which seemed very strange, the member of staff came back out and informed us that my daughter had been put in the wrong clinic. They informed us that they could not see her as this would be taking another consultant's patient. At this point I interjected, in disgust, as we had already been at the hospital for over 2 hours. I said to this member of staff that first of all they should not be asking personel questions in the corridor and then asked who had made the mistake; the consultant or the clerical staff. At this stage the sister on duty intervened and proceeded to try to find out what had happened.\nOnce again we were left to sit and wait, after around 20 minutes the sister returned to advise us that there had been a mistake (but didn't state by who) and went in to see the member of staff. The member of staff then came out into the corridor and informed us that they would see my daughter if it was an emergency otherwise she would have to rearrange the appointment. We objected on the basis that she had already been waiting since being referred in August, and knew that potentially the swelling could indicate the presence of a tumour and she had taken a day off work to attend. I said that the way she had been treated was disgusting. Every time my daughter attends an appointment she loses money by having to take time off work. I said that it was not acceptable to wait for a further appointment and therefore she would like to see this member of staff. We then had to wait again whilst this person saw another patient before calling us in. Also present in the room at this time was a student in their final year and the sister. The member of staff examined Catherine's eyes. The sister left during the examination and then came back into the room and spoke to the member of staff who then told us that they had managed to get us the tests done, that they could not do in her surgery, and to go with the sister to get pictures taken.\nWe were made to feel that we should be thankful for having this done by the sister as they said that the lady taking the pictures was staying behind in her own time to do them. Pictures were taken and we then returned to the waiting area, and after 5 minutes the member of staff came to the door with the lady who had taken the pictures and informed us that more pictures had to be taken. We went with the lady again and had more black and white pictures taken and returned to the waiting area. After around 10 minutes the member of staff called us in again and showed us the colour pictures and the deviations on them, which the member of staff explained they hadn't expected to see. They then referred to the black and white pictures and told us that if my daughter had been born with this condition the pictures would glow, but they didn't and just showed a black square. They then said that they didn't want us to be concerned but as a precaution they were going to arrange for her to have an urgent brain scan before Christmas and that we would be contacted shortly.\nAs my daughter had not heard anything by late December she phoned the hospital and spoke to the member of staff's secretary. The secretary informed her that they had checked and confirmed that the scan had been requested in mid December, and that my daughter should receive a call as a letter would not get to her in time. My daughter was worried that it was getting close to Christmas and the secretary advised her that they did the scans in the evening and over the weekend, so the appointment would be before or just after Christmas so they advised her not to worry.\nOn the following day, my daughter received a letter regarding an appointment for a MRI scan at Runcorn Hospital for mid January. She contacted the hospital and was informed that the member of staff's secretary was not available until the following day and a message was left for them to contact her in the morning. She therefore called the MRI centre to explain the circumstances and to request an earlier appointment but was told that the request they had received had not been marked as urgent and that she would have to contact the hospital. As she had not received a call by 11am on the following day, she called the member of staff's secretary who said they would look into it and someone would call her back. \nMy daughter received a call from a someone and explained what had happened. They said they would ask the specialist that our original appointment was with to look at the notes. This person then rang back around an hour later to tell my daughter that the specialist had said all the tests were fine and that it was just a routine (non urgent) scan. I took the phone off her and spoke to this person directly. I told them that I didn't accept the specialist's comments as they had not examined my daughter properly in the first instance. I said I wanted a second opinion and that if it turned out that she does have a tumour, I would sue the Hospital for negligence. I was then told that if I wished to make a complaint to contact PALS. \nI phoned PALS and left a message requesting a call back. As I didn't receive a call back I called again and spoke to someone. I explained what had happened and they told me to make a complaint to the Chief Executive and that they would speak to PALS. I then got a call from another member of the PALS team (more senior) and explained in great detail yet again what had happened. This person informed me that they had tried to get the appointment (scan) brought forward without success, I told them this was unacceptable and that I would be making a formal complaint.\nI sent a formal complaint the next day, this was late December, and received an acknowledgement letter dated 6 days later, stating that consent was required to access my daughters records and that I should expect a reply within 30 working days. A further letter dated early January stated that a response would be provided by mid February.\nNo urgent MRI was arranged and the appointment/scan was carried out on in mid January as previously arranged. Despite following this formal complaint up via phone call and email after the date stated in mid February, I then received a further letter stating that a further two weeks was required to complete their enquiries and to provide a written response.\nTo date I have not received any further response, which suggests to me that the hospital simply can't be bothered to respond to formal complaints and appear not to care about how patients are treated or what their concerns are.\nIt would be useful to know where I can take this complaint to next, as I believe the hospital doesn't take complaints seriously!\nMy daughter has ended up having to have a lumber puncture which caused an ongoing problem with severe headache which resulted in her going back into hospital via ambulance and is now waiting to see a neurologist.", "My son was experiencing abdominal pain which started in the morning, it got progressively worse as the day went on. I called NHS 24 in the afternoon which by this time it was severe. I was told someone would call back in an hour. He got worse very quickly, I called back and was told someone would call back within 2 hours. \n\nEvery time I called I asked if there was somewhere I could take him myself as I had transport. By this time he was screaming in agony. I called an ambulance and was told this was not an emergency and they would refer me to NHS 24. I called NHS 24 again. I was told to take him to the local infirmary at 6: 30 P. M. I thought he would be seeing a doctor, it was a nurse who then sent us to another town 20 mins away. The Dr. there arranged for him to go to the hospital, I took him there which took another hour. \n\nHe was operated on at around 11: P. M. His appendix had burst by then and was badly infected. \n\nThis was a very frightening experience for us. My son was very unwell afterwards. I am very upset at the way we were treated. We were told it was not an emergency when it clearly was. My son suffered excruciating pain much longer than he should have and still could suffer complications from this.

Luckily, I am not a patient with diabetes, if I was, I would not want to attend that clinic!\n\nMy friend had an appointment in afternoon , she was told by the receptionist to come in early because she needed to fill out a questionnaire, and so we arrived at the diabetes centre at approximately half an hour early. \nThe receptionist was okay, the nurse doing the bloods was friendly and smiling, so was a man called Chris who was a fitness person of some sort. There were various members of staff who would periodically come out of their room and walk through the waiting area, a smile might have been nice, especially for anxious patients on their first visit, but no, you wouldn't think there was anyone sitting in the waiting area. \n\nTime was ticking away but no one seemed to be called in to see the doctor, when she did appear, she wondered around, then went to get a bottle and filled it up from the water fountain, still not appearing hurried or anything!\nEventually a patient was called in to see her.\n\nThere appeared to be a lady who was rather breathless and she came in to enquire where she could park her car, as the car park was full up, she was told by the receptionist that she would have to park in the main hospital car park, it was obvious to me that the breathless lady would not be able to walk that far, but the lady had to explain that, to the receptionist, only to be told there is nothing else she can do. There were still a lot of people to be seen, so the car park was not going to empty any time soon! If she parked anywhere else near the building she would be clamped and probably have to a pay a \u00a340 charge!\nThe breathless lady had to cancel her appointment!\n\nAn hour had passed since the scheduled appointment time and my friend had still not be seen by anyone yet, so she enquired to see if this was usual and told that it was!There was a delay due to the fact that the doctor appeared to be 45 minutes late. Then this doctor had the cheek to try to refuse to see a patient because the patient was 5 minutes late! ! Luckily this was overcome and the patient was seen. \n\nThe doctor never smiled when calling a patient in to see her. In fact I never saw her smile at all. \nAnother patient, who I discovered had a lot of trauma in her life in recent years, came out very distraught from seeing this doctor, and said, well, that's me, well and truly told off!\nThis doctor told my friend that the reason all the appointments were delayed was due to the nurse who was taking the bloods, so she didn't even apologise for herself being so very late, just blaming it on the nurse who was one of the few who were kind, friendly and human and doing her job well!\n\nAll this time in the waiting area with no one making a statement or trying to say something to reassure people, it was all very strange.\nI wondered, while I was sitting there, if it was because we were all overweight, I remember a lady doing a test on the television to see what peoples responses were to overweight people, first of all she appeared in a town as herself, nice figure, long blonde hair and reasonably attractive, people responded to her well, striking up conversation and waiters in a cafe were friendly and attentive. Next she wore a type of padded body suit, her hair and face were the same and she followed the same routine of going into town and going to the same caf\u00e9 etc. as before, when she was slim. The response was totally different, she had odd looks, the waiter did not attend her straight away and when he did was so different in attitude toward her! She was shocked at the difference and it was a big eye opener to her.\n\nWhilst listening to people coming out from their appointment, it appeared their treatment was extremely off-hand, demeaning and unfeeling in the extreme, to such an extent it was evoking extreme distress in some, to extreme anger in others\nSurely this is not the standard of treatment that the patients should have to accept on top of their own personal difficulties. Not only was the doctors behaviour anti social, she was quite happy to push the blame for the delays onto an innocent engaging and good mannered nurse, who carried out her job with a genuine air of friendliness and efficiency.\nMy friend eventually got into see the doctor at approximately an hour and a half late and she too received the same unacceptable treatment by that doctor\n\nAs an overweight person myself, I know what it is like to be treated with extreme negativity, it is most definitely counter productive to any benefits that might otherwise be achieved and in the context of this clinic, I would judge it to have bordered on abuse of the patients and almost certainly the patients would have left quite dejected and traumatised by what should have been a beneficial consultation!", "Hi,\r\nWe have read your story and thought you'd like to know that we may be able to help if you want to give feedback or comments, or raise concerns or complaints to the NHS.

However, my hospital experience left a great deal to be desired.\nAlthough I was taken in by ambulance to Casualty at Kings Mill Hospital it took over an hour for a nurse to triage me, during which time the ambulance staff had to stand around waiting - what a waste of their valuable time. I don't remember anyone coming after that, though my husband says I was semi-conscious - enough to co-operate. Apparently I was taken for scans and then taken by blue-lighted ambulance to Queen's Medical Centre at Nottingham. Apparently I had a sub-arachnoid haemorrhage.\nThe passage below is an extract from the longer piece I wrote on Facebook:\n\"I came out of theatre something between 7 and 7 and a half hours later and don't really have any memory of coming out of anaesthetic or of knowing I was on Neuro Intensive Care. The next few days have no particular memories other than how unbelievably nasty and uncaring some of the nursing staff were. \nA couple of them did seem to care and went out of their way to help, but it was only a couple. What sort of caring nurse, who knows (or ought to know)that their patient has such poor eyesight as to be officially classed as visually impaired when uncorrected (my prescription is -14 in one eye and -10. 25 in the other)and also has congenital spinal deformities tells her patient she's lazy because she can't see to walk safely to the bathroom, then puts her an adult nappy on and forces her to walk despite the back pain which is so intense it makes her pooh her nappy? Even better, the nurse then grumbles at the patient so she has to clean herself up unsupervised in a shower because the staff have other patients who need them...God help us all if this our NHS now.\nSorry if that offends anyone who reads this, but this happened to me. I was in hospital for 11 days, during which time I lost 12 pounds in weight and quite literally couldn't find a position to rest in any degree of comfort. The mattresses were/are memory foam, which is probably great if you've a normal spine but don't give anything like enough support to a deformed spine. They eventually put me on to a totally new regime for pain relief, despite that fact that the routine I follow has worked well for over a decade and which they eventually (6 days down the line)put me back to. \"\nOn discharge I was given papers in which it said I'd be seen in 6 to 8 weeks; my appointment has come through for August - five months on. Apparently they are short of neuro consultants but can't afford to employ any more.\nWe've already contacted the hospital about all this but not received any useful reply. \nSurely things can be done better and more efficiently?

I will post another response as soon as I the response of our maternity staff.\r\nThanks Arlian", "I first got in touch with the patient experience team at the end of October 2012, when my father was in QEQM in Margate. He had been experiencing severe angina attacks and as a result was admitted a few days earlier.\nDue to the severity of his condition while in A&E, as is customary, he had received blood thinners; however he experienced an extreme reaction to that intervention and asked medical staff constantly during his entire stay, why he was experiencing various intense reactions and there was little interest shown and no investigations. I can confirm that he made this known several times within my hearing.\nHe had increased temperature, pain and other symptoms on the Friday and did receive monitoring on the first ward, however all of this ended when he was woken from his sleep and moved late on Saturday night to Fordwich Ward. He did not understand why he was being moved given how ill he was feeling, and he was not given the chance to properly express this. While being moved to Fordwich, he experienced an angina attack, he told the individual moving him. This was ignored and he was placed in Fordwich anyway.\nAfter his admission and the initial work in the first few hours, during the rest of his stay, he was not monitored with a heart monitor or any other equipment to gather data about his heart rhythms, nor was there any investigation using the ward based mobile echo equipment, despite him advising that he was experiencing increased feelings of congestion in his heart and regular and constant angina attacks. I did not see these being recorded in his notes, despite reminding the nurses to do so.\nWhile on the ward, he was kept awake all night by the shouting of a patient who was becoming violent and throwing objects and other patients with dementia, his three fellow patients in his section of the ward were in a state of undignified undress, exposing themselves to visitors and being unaware of doing so. This became the pattern for the following nights, getting little or no sleep. He felt unsafe and concerned.\nI contacted the patient experience team due to my very serious concerns that he was not on a proper regime of medical monitoring, plus he had not been attended by a doctor since the Friday. The only observations being taken were his blood pressure once in the morning and once in the evening. The ward filed an on-line incident report on the Monday regarding the lapse in the protocol regarding the doctors/ consultants not responding to their requests for them to attend him.\nAs a result, there was no data on his file, which would have provided information and medical detail for his doctors/consultants to make informed clinical decisions on his behalf. His verbal information, which was being repeated and given to everyone who came to his bedside, was also dismissed and ignored.\nDespite the complete lack of proper data regarding his condition, and showing no attention to his information, he was discharged from Fordwich on Tuesday morning, by a consultant who did not physically examine him. I believe that this visit was prompted by several phone calls by myself to the medical secretaries that morning. By this time my father was in an extreme state of anxiety and distress, given the lack of any proper attention from nursing staff and doctors. He was worried and concerned at his angina attacks and that no one was listening.\nPost discharge, the next day, I telephoned the hospital and spoke to the doctor who discharged him. I reported that he was experiencing angina attacks, even while at rest during the night, every four to six hours and was told that this was not an issue, and to continue taking his spray.\nA few days later, in the early hours of the morning, my father was taken by ambulance to QEQM. He was subsequently transferred to William Harvey in Ashford and spent the next two weeks in ITU, the high dependency ward and the Cambridge Ward.\nHe had suffered a severe heart attack and cardiogenic shock and was put on a balloon pump while in ITU and his life was in danger for several days. In addition, he suffered severe and unusual complications from his reaction to blood thinners. He has permanent heart damage as a result.\nI have some questions about the stay at QEQM:\n1. Why was the protocol for an unusual reaction to blood thinners not followed, when my father advised of his symptoms hours after his admission?\n2. Does his medical file show that he reported it?\n3. Are the angina attacks which he experienced during his stay at QEQM recorded fully and completely on his file? I personally, reported three attacks to the senior nursing staff, (which I have recorded electronically) and saw no notes made.\n4. Why did he not have a heart monitor, to record the angina attacks and to provide important information?\n5. Why did he not have even a basic examination of his heart using the ward equipment? this would have shown any change in the blockages in his arteries.\n6. Why was he not given a priority angiogram, nor any prospect of one, given that the last investigation had been two years ago?\n7. Why was he moved between wards on the Saturday night and no continuity of care provided?\n8. Why were there no proper medical observations made during his time on Fordwich?\n9. Why was his consultant name changed when he was moved to Fordwich, to that of a consultant who was on holiday and absent from the hospital, as confirmed to me by his secretary?\n10. Why did the doctors ignore the visit requests from Fordwich and fail to follow protocol and fail to respond to the nursing staff?\n11. Why, upon his readmission to QEQM A&E, was there no continuity in the hospital records to show his reaction to the blood thinners? This would have been invaluable information for the medical teams at the William Harvey and may have avoided severe, life-threatening complications subsequently.\n12. I have asked to see a full paper copy of ALL the medical records held at QEQM for my father, and any of his records held by the EKHT.\nIt is my contention, that during the first stay his medical record was not being fully and properly maintained. For example, I would expect that the many angina attacks he experienced should be in his notes. If that data is not present, then that will form the basis of some very serious questions about the failure in his care.\nIt is also my contention that his care did not follow the correct procedures and protocols. I suggest that as a result, his medical and nursing care was sub-standard and potentially negligent.\nTo be clear, my father and I am expecting a formal written report which addresses these issues - following a full and formal audit and review which conforms to the full Complaint Procedures, including statements following documented formal interviews with all relevant members of staff from the Trust. Plus a statement from the Trust detailing what will be done about the conclusions and findings.\nIt is now six months since I first contacted Patient Experience. I understand that there is a stated, expected response time within the process to respond to this sort of issue. I would have thought that given the severity of this matter, it would be given full and prompt attention. I am still waiting.

The tube has to be inserted by an Interventional Radiologist in an Interventional Radiology laboratory. This is done at a Specilist Hospital in London where we go for  paediatric gastric care.\nLast week we were concerned that the tube had become displaced - that it had moved back to his stomach. We went to our local hospital where after an X-Ray, it was confirmed that this was the case. However, in discussion with the Specialist Hospital in London, it became clear that they would not be able to bring my son in to redo the Interventional Radiology procedure outside working hours. Hence, with a bank holiday, we were told that Matthew would have to wait 3 and half days before having his tube re-inserted and meanwhile he would only be able to be fed on water and diaralyte into his stomach - if given milk without the tube in place, there is too high a risk that he will be sick and aspirate (choke). This meant that Matthew was deprived of food from Friday afternoon until Tuesday lunchtime when the tube was successfully re-inserted at the Hospital in London.\nMy concern is my son was deprived of food for over 3 days because the specialist hospital does not have an emergency/on-call system for Interventional Radiology that supports doing these procedures out of hours or at the weekend. I do not think it is right to deprive a child of food for that long because of this and the specialist hospital that provides this service should put in place emergency access at the weekend to prevent vulnerable children being unnecessarily starved for several days at a time due to the unavailability of staff.\nI would also like to say that the medical and nursing care, when received, was excellent - my concern is the lack of system organisation to manage children like my son at the weekend and particularly a bank holiday weekend.", "I don't imagine you will publish my story. \nI was assaulted and abused by a rude, uncaring radiographer at Good Hope Hospital in April 2013.\nI wrote a letter of complaint to the Chief Executive a few days later.

We take these comments seriously however, and we will highlight this to all staff via the staff hand-over meetings.\nThe usual pathway for women in labour is to contact maternity triage however support and advice can be obtained via the labour ward. Both areas are prone to high activity and there may be a delay in answering calls. It is however extremely unusual for the telephone not to be answered by any member of staff especially if ringing continues. We are able to access call and line usage but would require dates and times to follow this up. \nThe majority of mothers stay in the labour ward after delivery and are discharged home directly from their delivery room.  It would be the expectation that the linen should be changed if soiled, so that the mother may rest if required. Again the fact that this was not done will be highlighted to staff.\nStaff would normally advise on personal hygiene and care of the stitched area. However some mothers resistance is lower due to the tiredness associated with a new baby and they can be more prone to infections.  Having stitches does not mean that an infection will be acquired.\nWhen staff are not in the room, it is normal practice to ensure mothers have access to the call buzzer should assistance be required.   Again this, along with the height of beds, will be highlighted to staff.\nWe are sorry that you feel your experience has caused postnatal depression and a fear of having other children.

They eventually sent him to a ward, where it was noticed by myself and my mother that he was acting strangely, I notified one of the nurses, they came and saw him, then told us it was our fault for overwhelming him with us being there - the family that he loved and was with him all the time.\nBy this point we were still no nearer to finding out what was causing my dad to be ill. We asked to see the consultant that was treating my dad, we had a meeting with the consultant where we asked them questions about what they thought was wrong with my dad but didn't really get any straight answers. \nBy this point in time, my dad was really beginning to deteriorate, his body swelled and he could no longer walk around, he was moved to another ward, this time a ward for stomach, liver and kidney problems, but we still had no answers for medical staff as to what was causing my dad to be so ill.\nHe became bedridden and developed massive swelling all over his body, nothing was ever done to reduce this swelling, he didn't eat or drink, and we began to notice that his toes were going black.\nHe was in so much pain, especially in his head, his tongue swollen so much that he could hardly talk and it was heartbreaking to see a man I loved so much in that much pain and he wasn't being treated for anything, they would give him morphine for the pain but that was it. He developed bruising all over his body, especially on his head and legs and yet they still didn't know what was wrong with him.\nHe died on Easter Sunday 2011, he had had a bleed in his stomach, and all his organs were failing, he couldn't breathe his lungs had filled with fluid, and we watched him die. It was the most painful day of our lives. The doctor said he died from multi organ failure and acute vasculitis, but still to this day we don't know what caused him to have organ failure or why nothing was done to stop things from getting so serious. He was in that place for 5 weeks and was only 66.\nI cannot fault the nurses on that last ward he was in, they tried their best to look after him and keep him comfortable, but to me, he never got any proper treatment from the doctors. I really believe that his death could have been prevented, and we still don't know why our dad died 2 years on.", "My mother suffered a stroke in April 2013.\nThe initial response was fantastic, the ambulance was with us in less than 10 minutes and the paramedics confirmed by opinion she was FAST positive (I am a trained nurse). She was taken to the HASU at Charing X and we were taken straight into critical care.\nAlthough I had known she was ambulant 90 minutes previously, as I hadn't actually had contact with her, they refused the thrombolysis treatment. She had a CT scan, which showed nothing, and was then taken to the stroke unit.\nShe became very drowsy due to the brain oedema and a CT scan done on day 3 showed the lesion by then. Apart from a paralysed arm, all her other limbs are fine and she has cognition. Her care was fantastic.\nThings took a turn for the worse when she was admitted to West Middlesex Hospital on day 3, late at night. On day 4 the Occupational Therapist called me and we chatted for nearly half an hour. During this time I informed her that my mother had severe hearing loss and she requested that I bring in her hearing aids. I also informed her that my mother had vascular dementia and gave her the details of who looks after this.\nOn day 5, I visited my mother in the afternoon. She was still very drowsy and not making eye contact, which is apparently normal for this type of stroke. I waited a long time to speak with the sister and by the time she turned up, I had to leave to get to work. I informed the staff that my mother couldn't hear and that I had left both her hearing aids and her distance vision glasses in her locker.\nSadly due to my husband's ill health, I was unable to visit my mother for about 10 days. When I visited again I was there for nearly 4 hours and during that time it became apparent that the ward staff had no idea that she was deaf, didn't know she had hearing aids with her and didn't know about her dementia.\nThey blamed Charing X for not providing the information, but when I explained that the OT had phoned on the day after admission and had received this information, they were astonished. They immediately gave her the hearing aids and once inserted she immediately responded to them. I believe that up to this point they thought she was badly brain damaged, even though the position of the lesion would not be expected to cause this.\nDuring my first and subsequent visit, I examined the nursing notes and informed staff that I was concerned about her coughing. She was not on oxygen assistance when transferred and has not been oxygenated since arriving at West Mid. Her sats were being maintained above 96% on room air, which is adequate. I asked if a chest X-Ray had been performed or was planned and received a negative reply. No one seemed to take my concern seriously.\nYesterday morning I received a phone call from the stroke SpR, informing me that my mother has a chest infection [only diagnosed yesterday, some 3 weeks after admission] and that she is very poorly and now on antibiotics.\nI am disgusted with the level of care she has received so far. It seems that if I can't be there every day (I work shifts 5 days a week and have an ill husband to look after), then nothing gets done. I have informed the SpR that I am making a formal complaint to the CEO and I fully intend to bring a medical negligence case against all involved in her stroke [she had been taken off anticoagulants and BP medication] from the so-called preventative medication, right through to the post-stroke care.\nThey are now running around like headless chickens and hopefully she is getting the right treatment, but I shouldn't have to kick up a fuss to get this treatment done properly. If I wasn't a trained nurse and could spot the warning signs, heaven knows what would have happened.", "After horrific side effects from a chemo drug and other complications my husband lost stones. In the first two weeks had lost three stones and still cannot walk.\nThe operation was four weeks ago there has been no nourishment or protein in his body for five weeks. I complained to the staff about the lack of food he was having and asked if I could see the chart with his food intake.  This was in Inverclyde, I was told no chart had been kept but they would start one.  I only found out about his weight loss because I asked him if they had weighed him he muttered something (he was extremely weak and could barely communicate). When I asked a nurse about the three stone losses they said I was must have got it wrong, so I asked for it to be checked I was told at that time that they can't force someone to eat. \nAs far as I was concerned that was like saying he would be left to die from starvation and that's when someone said it was right about the weight loss and they had notified the dietician. He was nauseous and said the food tasted like sand and he could only manage porridge and custard. I spoke to the dietician the following morning by phone and told her of my concerns she agreed to see him the next day.  \nWhen my daughter and I visited him that afternoon we asked to see the diet sheet, to see if we could help with anything on it. We could not read it and asked if the nurse would tell us what it said and she also had difficulty reading it.  In the end we managed to find out he was to have two special protein soup four 50ml total.  Twocal is another protein drink but not vanilla as that made him sick also four small bottles of milk. \nI asked to come in at lunch to see what he was eating, they came and asked what he wanted but he couldn't stomach anything on offer and neither would I have. When I asked about the special soup and diet that was to be provided, the nurses who were helping with the meals had no idea what I was talking about. They had obviously not been told to read his notes they went off to have a look and came back and offered the soup.  If I hadn't been there he would have been left to starve. He was given the large bottle of twocal in vanilla and when I asked why he wasn't given the milk he was supposed to have I was told he has to ask for it as they didn't know what he was to have. I told them I wanted the milk put on his tray whether he asks for it or not. \n\nI spoke to the dietician and asked what sense there was in her making a chart and no one paying the least bit of attention to it, things did not improve he is so week he can barely walk.   So on being told he was to be moved to the Larkfield Unit for intense physio we thought there would be a light at the end of the tunnel.  Nope, no intense physio up for a walk once a day, as they have 29 patients they can't give him two walks a day. They don't work the weekend and are off at Bank Holiday.  Why do they not have cover for the weekend, as far as I'm concerned the progress made during the week is lost as three days have passed and he needs two people to get him out of bed so they say they don't have the staff to deal with it, after the walk he is then left to sit on a chair. Due to my husband's condition his body and bones ache.\n I was only told tonight by someone that he had been left sitting on a chair for more than two hours and had pleaded to be allowed to get put back to bed but was told he would have to sit there as they hadn't time to do it. I am raging mad and will be looking for answers tomorrow he has now been in this unit for over a week and another dietician has been called in. \n\nTwo of the nurses can't make out what is written, why they can't type it or write in block capitals. I was also told by a nurse he had eaten two sandwiches and toast, when I queried this I was assured he had and I knew this was wrong as he couldn't eat any bread. I was also told he said he would like me to bring up a breast of chicken this was also wrong as the chicken has to be with roast and mash potatoes and loads of veg. I knew these were either wrong or they're mixing the patients information up. \nThis is beginning to read like a comedy sketch so I will not be taking this anymore.  The patients illnesses do not take a break so why are they left with no treatment at weekends and why are more staff not employed. The Scottish Parliament is going to be informed about the lack of staff and care in this centre. \nI would also like to comment on what someone else reported about Larkfield that is when they do get to answer the buzzers which can take quite a while. They say they will be back in a few minutes and they don't appear for up to an hour, and their answers are they are very short staffed. \nWho then is in charge of staffing in a unit such as this where bedridden patients need to be treated with dignity and respect and not left in fear of soiling themselves? There are a few really caring members of staff but they should not be put upon by ones who have no compassion and clearly should look to another profession. This report had better not have repercussions for my husband as they are taking on the wrong person.\nWhat I would really like to happen is that the administrators are shown my posts as I can't see what good it is in showing it to staff when they clearly can't do anything about it as the staffing levels are the responsibility of the Admin and I'm sure they are well aware of the problems in this Unit. and until they start to show they are genuine about patients welfare and not money nothing will ever change. \n", "Here is an extract of the failings of my father's care and this is an extract of the letter sent to the ward Matron and PALS. I can honestly say that I would not send another family member to that hospital ever again and that we would rather travel the extra distance and go to Sheffield. Not only is the care appalling but the lies and an excuse made up after to try to cover them is unbelievable and does nothing to help mourning family members.\nDear? I am writing to you because you were so honest and open with me about my father's condition. Sadly my father passed away in my arms within approx. 4 and a half hour of being at home. I had returned to West Yorkshire on the Sunday evening, due to a busy work schedule and to attend my mother in laws funeral on the Tuesday and was waiting for my youngest daughter to arrive back from America to break the news that her grandfather only had approx. 4 months left to live.\nMy daughter that lives in Chesterfield had spoken to the ward sister on my behalf on Monday 25th February at approx. 3. Pm. Here is an extract of the conversation. Basically much the same as you told me, but that:\nPneumonia was getting better, (anti-biotics for 7 days)\nFibrosis getting progressively worse.\nUnable to do another chest x ray because the pneumonia would show up scarring.\nTested without oxygen and seemed to be normal, however if making him feel better would be left in place.\nNot able to go back on Mirtazapine due to liver function. but would monitor and may go back on reduced dosage.\nStill catheterised\nPressure boots in place\nRed bottom not stage 1 not breaking, would be monitored\nEating little and often, hence weight gain.\nThat we had to choose one person for point of contact.\nWe had already inquired about getting my father back home because it was his wish, he felt that should he have to stay in hospital much longer he would die in there.\nMy daughter was told that getting him home could be arranged.\nHome oxygen could be arranged within 4 hours, can take 24 hours depending on circumstances\nSocial Services would be involved before discharge\nPalliative Care would be involved before discharge\nRight For Care Plan would be put in place along with\nDNAR form would need to be put in place if required.\nDue to my not being able to get back to Chesterfield until the Thursday evening it had been discussed that a family meeting would be held to decide on the point of contact. The majority of the family wanted me to be the designated point of contact, due to my experience within the NHS.\nOn Wednesday the 27th February I received a call at work from the hospital saying that my father was being discharged that afternoon and that my step mother had decided she would be the point of contact, which meant that she could not (or would not )discuss any further information with me.\nThis was very upsetting because being so far away from my father meant it was important for me to have up to date information regarding his condition etc., to allow for travel time from West Yorkshire to Chesterfield.\nI had to wait until I got home from work that evening to find out that my father had not been discharged due to Home oxygen not being sorted out. My eldest brother went to the hospital at 6. 30 pm to find my father sat on his bed, dressed but only wearing a t shirt, shivering with cold and barely able to string two words together, due to being taken off his oxygen all afternoon, his bags where packed, and he was waiting to go home. My brother had to inform him that he wasn't being discharged that day after all. He then had to get a nurse to get some fresh bedding and put my father back into bed. I cannot begin to imagine just how distressing this was for him.\nI was so upset that I rang the hospital the following morning from work to ask (complain about) what had happened, they didn't seem to know which code had been used to order the home Oxygen whether it be 4 hour urgent or 24 hours normal hospital discharge, but did admit that they had known from 5pm that he was not being discharged that day, so why had they not informed my father themselves and got him settled back into bed.\nI received a call from my brother at approx. 1. 30 pm to say my father was back at home settled into bed with his oxygen. I waited for my daughter to arrive back from America, whilst packing my bags in order to go stay with my father for the next 6 days and to organise a rota within the family to ensure that dad was never left alone. My husband was finishing work early to drive me to Chesterfield.\nAt approx. 4 pm I got another call from my youngest brother saying that dad was making strange gurgling noises and that he had called the doctor. I knew immediately what this meant and rang my daughter to get her to my dad ASAP, along with the rest of the family members.\nI then had to endure the worst two hour journey of my life fighting through tea time traffic to get to my dad's side.\nI arrived at approx. 6. 10 pm and dad passed away in my arms with me only managing to tell him I had arrived and that I loved him, I tried ring his GP but it was already out of hours and by the time someone from 111 had got back to us it was too late.\nDad's doctor arrived later and immediately apologised because he had not been informed by the hospital that dad was so ill and had assumed that with him being discharged that afternoon that he had probably picked up a chest infection.\nWe had to then go through the trauma of having to have a post mortem.\nMy problem is, why was no one around when my father was dying, where was the palliative care team, why did we not have a contact number for them, where was the Right to Care Plan, why had we not been issued with any DNAR form. What if my father had needed morphine and no one was around to administer any syringe drivers. Why was no one from any nursing team available? Dads GP had organised for their district nurse team to visit the next day, even his carers that must have been informed by the hospital that he was being sent home arrived on the Wednesday evening to be told that the discharge had been cancelled, and then they arrived to put dad to bed after he had passed away.\nI know that no one can be exact about when a person will die, but surely if my dad had been examined by a doctor before his discharge on the Thursday, why did we not get any indication that dad had deteriorated so badly.\nYou told me yourself on the 21st that dad was very ill and that we were looking at 4 months and that you did not feel the need to be calling everyone to his bedside at that time, but that you would have a better idea of how long after the anti-biotics had had time to work. (you said you would have more of an idea before my mother in laws funeral on the 26th) Obviously I was unavailable to talk to you again before this date, but that is why my daughter spoke to the ward sister on my behalf\nPlease can you look into all this and tell me what went wrong, because something clearly did, communication was definitely very poor.\nI also have a few other issues that need addressing regarding my dad's stay in hospital.\nI asked again on the Thursday and Friday about why the Mirtazapine had been stopped and still no one could give me an answer, which my dad's GP has said himself that he saw no reason why it should have been stopped he had checked my dad's blood results himself on ICE, I know being stopped so suddenly from 30 mg Mirtazipine would not have helped dad's frame of mind.\nOn the 23rd of February one of the patients in dad's bay was moved off the ward due to Norovirus, which I saw myself and was told by a member of the nursing team on the Sunday, yet my dad was left in the same bay when he was especially susceptible to infection.\nOn the 24th we had to point out to the nursing team that my dad's cannula had been left in place since the Tuesday evening 6 days, which again should not have been allowed, and was only moved when we pointed this out.\nWe also found out that one of the supplement drinks that he had been given by the hospital was almost 6 months out of date.\nDad was only every given his sleeping meds, Zopiclone whenever myself or my daughter where present to request it for him.\nYet again I have travelled 70miles to be told an absolute utter pile of rubbish by the hospital regarding these issues, even denying that the medication had been prescribed by their pharmacy. To say I am angry and upset is an understatement, and I am not prepared to leave it there and allow such failings to continue. This hospital underwent Care Quality Commissioning inspections in August 2012, they failed on 3 outcomes and these are all the same outcomes are all the same as the issues we had with my father's stay at the hospital, so clearly lessons have not been learned actions have not been put into place for improvements. I would advise anyone that has to stay at this hospital, please ask to be shown your medical records daily to check what is being actioned regarding your stay in hospital, insist on checking your medication records are accurate, and for any one that has someone admitted to this hospital with dementia or learning difficulties be alert, push the staff to take notice of your concerns and to not, like myself believe that the hospital only has the patients best interest at heart.", "We were very concerned to read about your and your mother's experiences at our hospital.

Our care under the midwives was faultless, and I absolutely loved being a first time mum. At 7 weeks I took our son to the doctor for his 6 week check (they made the late appointment, not me) and the doctor commented on a faint reddish mark on his cheek that was about the size of my smallest fingernail. I said I didn't know what specifically caused it, but that I thought he must have bumped his cheek when his Dad was cuddling him shortly before the appointment. Nothing more was mentioned. The rest of the check went fine and we went home. I mentioned the mark to my husband who said the baby had been trying to hold his head up and had bumped his cheek on the corner of his glasses. We didn't think anything more of it.\n\nA few hours later we got a phone call from the health visitor saying that the doctor was concerned about the mark and that we needed to take the baby immediately to the hospital where we would be met by social services and the police. It was absolutely the most traumatic, humiliating experience. My mum, who lives with my husband and I, came with us, and we reported to A&E where we met with a lady from social services. She looked at the baby and couldn't even see the mark, we had to point it out to her. Then a police constable arrived, and she also couldn't see the mark. They both expressed their surprise that we had been called to the hospital in this way. We were taken to a private room and questioned. A consultant came, and stripped the baby and examined him. He concluded that he was a well-cared for baby and his exact words told us that the mark is very small and could possibly be a bruise, but it isn't clear. He agreed that it was the same size as the corner of my husband's glasses. The lady from social services was unhappy that the doctor had not mentioned any concerns at our appointment earlier that day.\n\n    I understand that if doctors have concerns about abuse they need to be followed up. However she had stripped the baby naked during the examinaton and could see there was nothing else, and I don't know why she thought that, if I had hurt him on his face, I would have taken him to the doctors for the check up at all? ?\n\n    This experience completely knocked my confidence as a new first time mum. I was paranoid every time the baby scrammed himself with his fingers or his cup, and was so anxious about being judged that we ended up not going to many of the local mother and baby groups I had been looking forward to, and instead I paid to go elsewhere to private groups. We have been told that this is on our permanent record, even though the consultant and social services were satisfied that we hadn't done anything wrong. Other than that we had no follow up. At a subsequent visit the health visitor said that the doctor had been concerned that the baby was bruising without cause and had wanted him seen in case it was a medical condition - well if that was the case I don't think social services and the police would have turned up.\n\n    It has felt like for the last year the health visitor has been trying to justify reporting us to the police and social services back when the baby was 7 weeks. She makes constant comments about the baby being unhappy (he isn't) and underweight (he isn't). I was so badly frightened by the initial experience at 7 weeks that I didn't pull her up on her comments, and now they have progressed to things like Why are you sweating so much? (hot room as babies get stripped and weighed there), and Oh has your dad come with you today? Oh well he's quite slim so I suppose it's possible the baby will just be slim. '. At his 9 month development check she gave him two wooden blocks, and just as he started to play with them she wrenched them off him and said I should be more careful in case he put them in his mouth. He started to cry and wouldn't do any of the other things she asked him to (bang two toys together, play with a bead on a string). The other mums I have spoken to have said their 9 month old babies wouldn't do these things on request in a strange environment either. The HV grudgingly allowed the baby to pass the test, but insisted we have a 6 week nursery nurse 'intervention' to show me how to teach him to do things properly. When the nursery nurse came she said the baby was happy and was doing everything he's supposed to be doing, and more.\n\n    After the 'intervention' was cut short because it was not necessary, I have finally had enough. I am moving area and will be changing health visitors. I have been putting up with this for too long because I have been frightened that if I try and stand up for myself they will get social services involved again. It has basically been a nightmare from start to finish, but I have finally realised that I am a good mum, and that this has been the only major cause of stress over the whole of the first year with my son. These people are supposed to be one of the main sources of support for new mums - this feels like a joke.\n", "Thank you for your valuable feedback regarding your devastating experience. We hope you have now been able to meet with someone from PALs to be able to take this forward further.", "He was admitted at the end of April 2013 after being found on floor by my husband. It was obvious to us he had had a stroke. Was moved off admissions the following day onto ward c8. They had earlier diagnosed my dad with a water infections n pneumonia. He was very confused so mentioned it to staff who said if it doesn't improve he will go for a brain scan. This showed my dad had actually had a stroke. He was in this ward for 12 days and in all that time wad not seen once by anyone from the stroke team. I find this utter bewildering. \n\nNo doctor came to see me or my family to explain what had and was going to happen. I was told 3 times my dad was going to be moved to b2 but this never happened until the beginning of May when I threatened to put a complaint in. Lo and behold he was moved half an hour later. The stroke has left my dad incontinent, and unable to feed himself. \n\nHe weighed 60kg wen he first went in and now weighs 47. 3kg. He has been left in wet bedding, not been given the fluids he needs regularly. I could go on and on. By the way my dad is 90.", "I attended Gartnavel Royal Hospital in late May 2013 for my Pre-Assessment Appointment, the nurse who took me into the room could not have been any nicer.\nI was then informed to go to a ward to see a junior doctor who then sent me back down to the clinic which I was told to have an ECG. On arriving there the clerk of that department was rude and cheeky and was told this could not be carried out. I then went back up to the ward and told the junior doctor this and after she had seen me I was told to go back down that they would take me.\nOn my arrival back down at the pre-admission clinic I told the nurse (who was different ) to the one that carried out my assessment that I was told to have an ECG. This nurses attitude to me was disgraceful and told me exactly if I wasn't happy to make a complaint. She wasn't caring then she also accused me of being abusive to which I certainly was not, given there was no one to take my complaint I left the hospital without having my ECG. This nurses attitude was terrible and after her making the accusation I was abusive she then said go to hell", "I presented to the crisis unit with suicidal ideation having had long term depression. Basically I want to die every day and living is hell. I was seen after a 3 hour wait despite visibly and repeatedly breaking down in front of total strangers in reception. This was also despite 6 or 7 members of staff chatting merrily away in the reception office about social matters.\nEventually I was seen by an 'assessor' who spent 50 mins with me taking notes about how I felt like I wanted to kill myself. Finally he told me that my case would be discussed and assessed for treatment the following week. When I called the following week, I was told the meeting had to be cut short and it wasn't discussed but would definitely be the following week. When I called again, they again said they hadn't gotten round to it.\nI was now in full crisis having had a breakdown at work. Finally they called me to say that I wouldn't be offered treatment as I'd been offered treatment in the past and turned it down. I hadn't, and tried to tell them their records were wrong. I had to threaten to take it to the Chief Exec before they admitted their mistake and referred me to the Complex Care team. The earliest appointment they said they could give was 4 months away.\nIn that 4 months, I've lost my job, am about to lose my home. I finally had my appointment today which was yet another assessment (my 5th in total). I've been placed on a waiting list for therapy. I've been told it will be another 6 months.\nI don't know what to do. I don't know how to cope for 6 months. I'm so angry at the NHS. The Mental Health team at St Anne's are apparently set up for the benefit of the staff and not the patients. In my view, they have little or no understanding of mental health - for example, if you miss an appointment, they assume its because you no longer need treatment, not that your mental illness may prevent you leaving the house.\nThey've extinguished the little hope I had. But nothing will change because mental health patients aren't taken seriously even by the people who are supposed to help. I hope I survive this depression long enough to see to it that NHS Haringey is named and shamed for being the hellhole it is.\nNo wonder so many awful tragedies play out with these people.

She seemed to have little understanding of what I had experienced and which had left me traumatised. She seemed to think she knew better than the experienced psychiatrists and psychologists I had seen and from whom I had reports.

She kept focusing on setting goals \u2013 I felt this was inappropriate as I needed other help and support before setting goals. She gave me a slip of paper to take home and read. One of the questions on this were inappropriate for my condition \u2013 eg did I feel guilt after consuming any quantity of alcohol. These were questions more appropriate to an addict and I pointed this out to her. What I needed was cognitive therapy not this form of counselling.\nI felt the counsellor did not have enough experience or maturity. I felt that she was quite rude and self opinionated I told here I did not feel I was being helped by her and on leaving the room in a very distressed and stressed state. (She just stated in a sarcastict manner) Bye then\nI walked out of the session I stated I wished to see the manager the counsellor stated I could not and that I had to put it in writing any complaint and just pushed me out in to the public reception area. The receptionist saw I was very distressed crying and shaking she sat me down and gave me a cup of water I told her what had happened with the counsellor. The receptionist stated I was not in a good state to leave I asked, could I see the manager and the Manager became involved. I explained how I felt during my session with the young counsellor and why, but did not receive any acknowledgement of this or an apology from her. The Manager said she needed to get away to a meeting she just asked what it was I wanted from them, this I found made me further depressed and unhappy as again I felt no empathy from this lady also, she just kept looking at the clock, I felt she wanted to go to lunch as when I went out into the public reception I stopped to thank the receptionist and the manager was leaving with a colleague it looked to me as if, they were going to lunch together. Iit seemed that she was not prepared to make time for me even though I was feeling very upset crying and shaking due to the experience I had just suffered.\nThe receptionist who witnessed all of this was the only one who expressed any support or empathy. She got me a glass of water and waited while I was able to calm down. During this time I saw the Manager leave the building \u2013 I didn't get the impression she was off to a meeting.\nAs I left the building a little while later I saw the young counsellor returning from lunch with another young colleague. They both saw me and started to snigger \u2013 I felt that this was a real sign that confidentiality had been breached. I got home and rang Inclusion Matters to speak to the manager about this. Again there was no hint of an apology.\nThese people are dealing with vulnerable people but don't seem to understand this.\nNone of my contacts with Inclusion Matters has been good! I was not able to make my initial appointment and phoned them to rearrange it. The girl I spoke to just kept saying that If I did not make it to the next appointment I would be struck off! This was also continuously said by the Counsellor at each appointment which caused me more distress. I was also upset to see that on each visit you were made to fill out the same forms in the public area answering the same questions this took time away from the 45 minuites you were given. I refused to answer any more questions on a continuous basis on my drinking pattern each visit and stated, I was not attending due to my having a drinking problem. I was also told when I stated this that they do not counsell addidcts yet they asked the questions regarding on each visit.\nI have been offered further sessions in a different location but again, on taking a call from a gentleman who sounds very young I feel I am not happy to sit and talk about what has happened to cause my illness with a young male. I have been unable to attend due to hospital commitments on the Tuesdays yet, they do not seem to want to change the days to an alternative day instead of on a Tuesday.\nI have now two major concerns, firstly I do not feel like the issues about my treatment so far have been addressed and I am also worried about carrying on with this service. I am not sure they have the right people to understand and address my needs but I still feel very vulnerable and my GP and others remain concerned about how I am. I am not happy to carry on with this service as I am not happy to be councelled by a young male. I have experienced a greater amount of stress and depression since attending the Inclusion Matters Programme. What happened to me was very serious and truamatic and has left long lasting implications on my life and health. I do not feel Inclusion Matteers has helped me deal with this in anyway and has shown little or no empathy not to mention confidentiality in regard to myself.\n ", "Thank you for sending in the feedback about our service.

It was my second c-section and I lost a lot of blood, felt dizzy and quite unwell in the following few days. The room I was in had 3 others, all who had had c-sections. The treatment we received was very poor (with the exception of one young member of staff who cared). We were treated like inconveniences, we were scared to press our buttons and were constantly told they were too busy. \nOn one occasion, a mum who was upset in pain and struggling to change her babies nappy asked for help, she was told they were too busy and she should do it herself. My husband then saw the nursing staff sitting sharing out malteesers. On another occasion, at 11pm, a member of staff took my temperature then walked out. I called to her to ask why and she said (while walking off), you may have internal bleeding. \nI was left, alone, scared and in pain, not knowing what the outcome would be. I believe my experience there was a contributing factor to my difficulty adjusting to looking after my baby following the birth.

A friend suggested as I had private medical insurance I should have it corrected. I went on line and found a consultant who was at Moorfields and also practised privately. This consultant said they could see scarring and performed a YAG laser capsulotomy. As I was sitting in position for this procedure, they mentioned seemingly casually there was a small percentage of these procedures ending in blindness. They did not intimate that what they were about to do not only might not work but could result in a posterior vitreous detachment. This is exactly what happened. I still have the original puffiness plus a vitreous detachment. It swirls about in my eye like a smeary curtain and I am now unable to drive at night and have to dim my lights at home. They also diagnosed blepharitis which I most certainly did not have. I would imagine had I have seen them on the NHS they would have left me alone - which would have been a blessing.", "In late October 2012,  I was taken to Lincolnshire County Hospital with a deep wound on my forehead after a blow to the face. I waited until 6 o'clock in the morning, and had a dressing pad stuck to my head without them cleaning it. \nAt this point you could actually see my skull through the laceration. I was sent home to sleep even though I know realise that this is very dangerous especially since I was going home to my university flat alone. \nI returned on in early November at 10: 30 to have my head stitched. By this time I noticed my forehead was very cold and when I touched the dressing it was saturated in blood proving that it had been bleeding overnight. I was given 8 stitches in my head and 4 stitches on the inside of my mouth as my teeth had come through my lips. \nI was not given any x-rays and have since found out that I have fractured my two front teeth up in my gum so I now need root canal treatments. \nI was not given any antibiotics or painkillers even though I'd hit my face off the tarmac which could of easily spread infection. \nBeing a student from Newcastle, it was my first and hopefully the last visit to Lincoln County Hospital and I don't really recall anything about the care that night being positive.", "I was taken to hospital in jan 2013 with severe abdominal pain and after many hours of waiting in agony with no information was told to wait overnight as I will be having my appendix out. At around 11pm someone came to me asking if I can wait til morning for the op as this time of night the surgeons are tired. Unbelievable. \nOf course I waited til the next day. Was told I could not have anybody with me before I went to surgery. I barely knew anything about when I was having the op or the procedure when a nurse came to me with a gown and cloth underwear told me to put it on as I'm going for surgery. I was rushed around, a nurse unlocked a toilet door whilst I was naked without knocking. I was required to do around 7 urines samples and bloods due to lack of communication. When down preparing for surgery a matron was disgusted that I hadn't given anything to eat or drink for nearly 2 days. \nI have continued to have to return to a&e with severe abdominal pains and have been told I'm faking the pain, told there's nothing wrong. Staff have been really horrible to me when I have been alone, in pain, scared and in tears. These are much older men and women and I am a 21 year old completely alone and frightened. Eventually have been sent away every time. \n\nI have now been off work 2 weeks with abdominal pain, have visited a&e and was sent home whilst in lots of pain and vomiting.

Taken to hospital as was in such pain, when finally got to see doctor said with out looking at my husband said well your doctor thinks kidney stones.   kept taking my husband to doctors. he was referred to Hospital every time.  Waited hours, seemed to be waiting all day every time to see who would be the one to get bed and be admitted.  He was admitted several times and sent home either because weekend (it seemed that everyone was out at  weekends and we used to see them readmitted few days later).\n We went to that hospital so many times it was obvious my husband was in great pain.  Till May, the last occasion, I said there is no way I'm going to take him home until you find out what is wrong.   He had to wait so long for scan, a week, I offered to take him privately.  This seemed to spur them into action, they then diagnosed him with cancer, put him on morphine, let him home and he died 2 days later. \nI have still got all the notes of every time we went and how badly he was treated.

Had no backup whatsoever from BGH nor was I prescribed effective medication. All I was offered was a repeat cystoscopy by at least 4 consultants, which I obviously declined.

Dorking hospital were concerned about the results of the scan, immediately called my gp to arrange a same day app so the gp could provide a letter for the hospital so I could receive treatment. I attended the gp surgery, obtained notes and was advised to present myself at A&E. I did this, the triage nurse was excellent and attempted to get me referred to the gynae dept who were apparently too busy. In the end a decision was made for A&E to see me and decide on action, whereby after a lengthy wait I was I formed I wasn't sufficiently ill to see the gynae dept. I protested this based on how I felt, along with Dorking hospital and gp opinion only to be told that not only had a gynae doc who hadn't seen my notes nor examined me ...had decided I would not be seen last night or indeed in the future for a follow up! !\nI became rather distressed as have been ill for over a month now and this advice contradicted 2 other medical opinions both obtained that day from clinicians who had actually examined me, only to be told \"this is what's happening. You need to return to your gp for more \"x\" medication\" and they disregarded the fact the medication was the same I'd already been on for a month, that hadn't worked and due to prolonged blood loss of 4 weeks the gp had referred me to them.\nAll in all I was distressed and disgusted at the gynae departments attitude of quote \"it's normal to bleed heavily and pass clots for a month after a baby\" despite explanations that I had a baby 3. 5 months ago and hadn't had any previous post partum issues.

I rang Locala to have a look and they believed it to be a faulty pump.\nA new pump for the bed was brought last week and was fitted, but the mattress was still not blowing up.\nI rang Locala again and asked for an engineer to visit and try to sort out the problem. They said maybe it was the mattress.\nWhen the engineer arrived, he had only brought a mattress with him. In order for them to look at the problem, I had to move my wife from the bed. It took three of us to move her. We had to move her on to a decorator's paste table whilst we waited.\nThe engineer took an hour and a half to fit the new mattress, during which time my wife was still on the paste table which was extremely uncomfortable. The three of us who had to help my wife move also had to wait around for this time.

I asked to be discharged due to not being on a mental health section\n", "Our father had mixed but generally very good care from doctors at Derriford Hospital since he was diagnosed with chronic renal failure nearly a quarter of a century ago. This included the thorough treatment he received prior to and following a successful Kidney Transplant in 1994. Also it is only proper to reflect positively on the care and attention he received from the many renal nurses and other care assistants/nurses who tended to him over the course of his many visits to hospital, all of whom he held in high regard.\nMost recently he had a different experience. He was very frustrated and disappointed and had become quite upset and disillusioned about the lack of care and lack of treatment and lack of information he was given following his admission to Derriford Hospital after a fall at home in late January 2013. This included him being discharged briefly for a week in late February and in my opinion ultimately led to his untimely death in late March 2013.\nOur father's sense of frustration had grown as he had been explaining since last summer to doctors about feeling extreme fatigue and a complete lack of energy and this had left him feeling light headed and weak. This symptom had only materialised after he had begun Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis at home. After beginning CAPD, he seemed to feel as if he was being left to his own devices and when he complained of fatigue and having no energy, he was told simplistically to exercise more. His complete lack of energy and weariness was what eventually led in late January to him falling at home as he lost consciousness whilst trying to make a cup of tea.\nIn my opinion Doctor A did not treat our father properly initially after his admission in late January. This included giving him a 6 day course of antibiotics (which seems surprisingly brief) for pneumonia on the left lung and then authorising his premature discharge in late February. Doctor A ignored our Fathers plea to examine his left lung pain and shortness of breath down to the diagnosis of two displaced ribs on the left side. It felt that our father's treatment was chaotic and dangerous seemingly due to failure of the Doctor A's lack of clear communication. Our father was often left dehydrated, with bleeding limbs due to apparent negligence and poor man handling from some doctors. Our Father only was addressed properly and informed of the current \u201ctrial treatment\u201d when I took his doctors to task on their lack of professionalism and compassion towards my Father's well being and recovery. Myself, my brother and our Father felt that we were never fully informed of our Father's treatment or reason for it, only that they were doing everything they could. However I do beg to differ on this point as within our Fathers last 24 hours numerous doctors from different departments were asked to see our Father to run numerous tests ie bone marrow samples. We do not understand why these tests had not been run earlier, particularly as it fuelled our family with false hope as the test results would take 7 days to return.\nSadly after his readmission due to breathing difficulties, the doctors we met on Mayflower Ward themselves seemed without much idea generally. Our father was particularly frustrated with Doctor B who he said was aloof and uncommunicative. When we observed Doctor B during his ward rounds a few days before my father died, he seemed quite unperturbed by our father's clearly worsening condition and claimed to be treating his chest infection \u2018empirically' on what proved to be less than 48 hours before his death.\nWe feel that our father was treated poorly during what proved to be his last visit to Derriford Hospital, and our experiences since his death have apparently confirmed the shoddy approach of some of the staff. We have both tried to liaise with the bereavement team at Derriford Hospital after our initial meeting with them the day after our father died, at which we gave permission for an autopsy to be completed. We gave our consent for a post mortem examination and sample to be taken on the understanding this would determine what had caused the chest infection and inform the doctors prior to our meeting with them to discuss those results. The doctors themselves wanted to know what had caused our father's death as they did not seem to know.\nFive months have now elapsed since we gave our consent for this procedure and we have not had information. We feel like we have been deliberately ignored and our attempts to ascertain what has happened are being frustrated, and we are left wondering why this is the case? We have sent in a complaint letter but the due date that the hospital set themselves to get back to us has expired. This seems to us not only unprofessional and to demonstrate a lack of care and thought for grieving relatives, but also seems symptomatic of the directionless treatment we believe our father received. It would seem at best to indicate an organisation that is incompetent and totally dysfunctional and is deeply troubling.\nThe bereavement team have not kept us informed about what has happened. We have requested a meeting with Doctor B so we can discuss the results from the autopsy together but have heard nothing. It was only the intervention of the Critical Care Team, who arrived on Mayflower Ward to accompany our father for an Xray who intervened and stopped what we regarded as being inhumane treatment. A junior doctor had the decency to apologise for this when we went to the hospital the day after our father died. This well meaning but inadequate response is all we have received by way of an explanation.", "Thank you for your feedback - you may already be engaged with staff at this Trust regarding your concerns and please be assured these will be fully investigated.

She received no treatment except pain killers.\nTwo days later it was decided she should be transferred to Huddersfield RI for an MRI scan the following morning, the doctor also stated she should receive morphine to relieve the pain. She was put in ward 18 at HRI. When the medicine was being given later we asked ref to Morphine as the doc had said. The nurses said as he had not written in down they cannot administer it, leaving my 7 year old in awful pain.\nEventually the following day she was given Morphine (some 84 hrs after been admitted) I feel this was not acceptable.\nShe was finally given a MRI scan at 5pm on the fifth day.  This proved inconclusive as it had not been done right. The MRI dept staff we came into contact with were very uncaring as my daughters knee was locked in an awkward position but they just pulled her leg and said she should have been given pain killers before coming down.  I think this is very uncaring for a little girl in bad pain.\nThe following day another MRI scan was done which showed damaged cartilage and meniscus damage. She was then transferred back to Calderdale Royal to have an operation the following day. During all the time she was in HRI my daughter had received deep bed sores, I believe the fact she wet the bed and was left in it with wet sheets for ages didn't help. The nurses at Calderdale Royal were appalled at the degree of these bed sores and arranged for pictures to be taken, saying this should never happen and she should have been put on an air bed. My daughter had the op and so far all seems ok with the exception we have now found out that the knee was only washed out and the meniscus and cartilage not touched. We were also informed my daughter should go for physio @ Broad St, Halifax. This was never arranged.\nShe now has problems with her other knee. We called 111 and an appointment was made at Calderdale Royal care direct. The doctor there saw Lucy and said we had done the correct thing bringing her in as she clearly cannot carry on like this in pain and unable to walk. The doctor rang Huddersfield RI (I was in the room when this was done) and made an appointment to see an Orthopaedic doctor at Huddersfield. So off we went with a letter for the Ortho doctor from the care direct doctor.\nWhen we arrived at Huddersfield we were informed no appointment had been made (I heard it being made) We were told we would have to go through A&E if we wanted to see a doctor. We waited 3-4 hours to do this and finally we were seen by 2 doctors, we went for an xray which was clear. The doctor we saw told us my daughter would need to be admitted to the ward and have a MRI scan on the Monday.\nWe informed the doctor as my daughter suffered the deep bed sores at the hopsital we would prefer her not to stay and we could bring her back fro the MRI. He made a few phone calls and said that would be ok and we were booked in for an MRI scan. I again asked the doctor if she will def be scanned on Monday because if not we would allow her to be admitted to the ward if that was what was needed.  The doctor assured me that the scan with the MRI dept was booked and that we will be phoned either Sunday or Mon with a time. The doctor also stated if we had not been rung by midday Mon we should ring back.\nOn Mon we rang as we had not been called only then to be told by the MRI dept that a scan had not been booked wasting myself taking a day off work.\nNow were are being told another doctor needs to see my daughter before any scan is done but due to holidays cannot see her until mid August ..\nI feel the first doctor lied to us and neglected the well being of our child, I double checked regarding the scan and was assured that one had been booked, which was clearly not the case.\nIn the mean time my daughter cannot straighten her knee and is unable to walk unaided, we have had to go to Calderdale royal and pick up some crutches as HRI A&E dept informed us they cannot give them to 7 year olds in case they fall over....so if she falls over without them its ok?\nAs we are due to go on holiday so I have asked for a medical certificate for my insurance, the hospital are refusing to give one until my daughter has been seen by a doctor in mid Aug.. even though she has been seen by a number of A&E doctors who wanted to admit her again..\nI'm looking at going down the legal route now as this has just got beyond belief in the meantime my daughter is still suffering and all we are getting told bring her to A&E which we already have done.\nWe cannot leave her at her normal out of school club and child minders as she cannot get about, but the NHS don't seem to give a damn about that, ,\nI have been in contact with CQC and also my local newspaper who is so appalled by this has passed it on to a national paper.\nMy priority is my daughters health and getting her right.\nI spoke with the doctor's secretary who stated they would go and book my daughter an MRI scan (another lie as we are informed secretarys cannot do this) and also find out what's been going on and ring me back. Well they never rang back but a Sister did telling me that they would not do a scan until the doctor had seen my daughter and this couldn't be done till mid August due to holidays. I stated this was not acceptable and leaving my daughter in pain that long is neglect. I informed them that I would get the MRI scan done privately to which I was told I couldn't as I didn't what scan needed to be done. I asked  to get this information for me then to which I was told I would be wasting my time and money. I asked if another consultant could see my daughter and was told they couldn't do that for me.\nI asked if they thought it was ok for my daughter to remain in pain unable to walk for 9 days until the doctor returned from holiday.   Again the response shocked me and was asked if I wanted the appointment in mid August or not.\nI said I wanted my daughter treated, and asked why do we have to wait to see a particular doctor before we can have a scan when another had informed us she needed one and even said that one had been booked?\nI feel this is total neglect of a 7 year old child, especially when I have even offered to go private for the MRI scan to speed up the process,\nSorry but just not acceptable.", "If you are having difficulty accessing GP care, you may want to talk to to Clinical Commissioning Group for your area.

The nurse kept turning the buzzer off. There was blood on the floor and the cleaner told us not to move as she would clean round us. There was also discharge on the bed all day. The ward was very hot so we took our own fan in. Our son had to keep asking for water. \nThe next day he went into SSCU ward. 2 days later he had a very high temperature and the nurse gave us flannels to cool him down. No other help seemed to be offered. The next day a urine bag which was attached to a catheter burst all over his legs and feet. \nOn the following day, our wonderful son very sadly passed away.

My GP diagnosed acute appendicitis (a clear diagnosis) and I was admitted to the Royal Hospital Calow Chesterfield as an emergency the next day.\nComplaint 1:\nI was not visited by a doctor for assessment immediately. it was the evening before I was assessed in the Emergency Admissions Ward. although the symptoms I described to the Doctor were classic apendicitis, he told me he believed it to be diverticulitis.\nComplaint 2:\nI was sent for an X-ray in the evening. I was given no feedback or results from this X-ray. I was then moved to Barnes Ward, bay 3.\nComplaint 3:\nI was told I would be sent for a scan. However, they told me that there was a backlog and the scan didn't take place until three days later. They confirmed at this stage that the appendicitis had now ruptured and leaking puss; that had it not ruptured, it could be removed but that this now could not be operated on because it had now ruptured. Bearing in mind I had been there for 48 hours, and the morphine did not touch the pain, I feel this delay was unacceptable. I also believe that had the scan happened straight away, it would not have ruptured. I feel the hospital has been negligent in this respect.\nComplaint 4:\nI told the nurse when I was admitted on that I had pain in my neck (I have spondilitis) and asked for some pain relief. I asked specifically for topical ibuprofen; this is how I usually manage my own pain. I was in such acute and unbearable pain, I felt the need to pace around the ward, causing further pain in my abdomen.\nMy daughter visited on Thursday evening and asked a nurse why this had not yet been provided over 24 hours after arrival. She was told this couldn't now be collected from the pharmacy because it had closed. My daughter let them know she was unhappy to hear of this poor patient care and said that had she been told, she would have provided this herself, which she did. I was very grateful she did, because it took the nurses 48 hours to provide this. \n\nComplaint 5:\nOn Saturday evening, I was seen by a doctor who told me that in all likelihood, I would be sent home on Monday. I questioned the wisdom of this considering I have a ruptured appendix and there is a high risk of serious infection. Although I understand that I have to be treated with antibiotics so that the infection can sufficiently reduce so that an operation can be done safely, I consider the hospital to be the safest place for me to be. The doctor said that my white blood count was encouraging, so I told the doctor I wanted to stay in hospital and have the appendix removed as quickly as possible.", "I write this letter as I feel I have been treated appallingly by Queens's hospital and would like some answers at why I was treated this way and why my situation seemed to be dismissed until it came to a near fatal stage.\nI would like to start by saying. I am extremely good when it comes to pain as a 31 year old that has experienced Kidney stones from the age of 13, Gall stones, gall bladder infection and numerous operations in my years. So I know when something is not right and I know when something is very painful, the only time I visit A&E is when I feel there is complete need to. I am very used to these sorts of bad pain and just get on with things. It takes a lot to grind me to a halt like this has.\n\nDay One Last suspected period date 5 Weeks prior, Clear blue pregnancy test showed 2-3 weeks pregnant. I did a test as I knew something wasn't right. I had been passing brown blood for 9 days starting from the day after my period was due and I had a lot of pain in my side which I put down to kidney stones for a week prior to taking the test.\n\nNext Day  The pains had got a lot worse overnight so I took myself to A&E as again I knew something just wasn't right. I was given a urine test and was referred to the Early Pregnancy Unit at triage without any explanation as to what might be happening. On arrival at the unit I had a blood test and whilst talking to the doctor I got a very sharp stabbing pain again which made me have to stop talking and double up. I explained to the doctor this was in the same category as Kidney stone pain (as I have suffered with stones for many years). The doctor looked at me holding my side and said the pain is in the wrong place to be ectopic. I then had an internal scan which showed nothing and the doctor said that she would note it as a non-location pregnancy for today as it was possibly too early to see anything on a scan but to go back 48 hours late for another blood test to see if HCG levels had increased.\n\nDay 4 Second blood test marked as urgent and I was told I would get a call with the results tomorrow evening.\nDay 5  HCG levels up  Scan booked for 3 days later.\n\nDay 8 Still bleeding and still have pains. Another Internal scan done and again nothing could be seen. I was told that so far everything pointed in the direction of a healthy pregnancy and it may still be too early to see anything. Another blood test was taken. later that day  I got a phone call saying my HCG levels were up again and I was being referred to a consultant.\n\nDay 11 Consultant. Pain is still persistent. I had a tightening feeling in my stomach. Another internal scan done, still showing nothing. Booked another blood test for Day 15 and the next day.\n\nDay 12 . Extremely bad pain, Unable to stand up shaking from head to toe. I called early pregnancy unit and they told me to go straight there. I got to the hospital at 12. 30pm. At 4. 30pm! ! ! I was finally taken notice of and given co-drydamol which I was very surprised about as this is a strong painkiller and I was pregnant. The painkillers did ease the pain off enough for me to at least sit up straight. I was called in to see the doctor who said if the pain has eased you can go home.  I was shocked, my reply to this was so you are not going to examine me then or scan me I had already explained that I was due to be scanned in 4 days' time. They told me there was no point scanning me as I was having another one soon and they were no good at scanning anyway so it's not worth it.  I insisted on being examined at least by hand. He said I can but if it was ectopic you wouldn't have walked in here he then half-heartedly examined my stomach by hand and told me to go home as everything was fine.\n\nBy 5. 30pm  I was at home and my pain had become very severe. The worst it has been. I was crying in agony but could not go back to the hospital to be left in agony for 4 hours, uncomfortable and sent home again. I was very upset at how I had been treated. By 6pm I felt extremely ill and was vomiting. I went to the toilet and passed a clot which was very thick and very dark red/brown colour of about 1 \u00bd inches in size. After this the pain started to wear off. I thought that was it that I had miscarried my baby.\n\nI was shocked that I was made to wait 4 hours without being acknowledged as the ward was well aware of my case as I had been there quite a lot over the last couple of weeks yet my notes were never retrieved. I felt this mistake of sending me home could have proved Fatal as I was to find out.\n\nDay 15  Went for a blood test. HCG Levels were up again . I was told that tomorrow if nothing could be seen on the scan I would be given the methotrexate injection tomorrow.\n\nDay 16   Another internal scan this time with the consultant, and 2 others present. I was scanned. The fetus was found in my right Fallopian tube. On finding this the consultant put his hands on his head and said oh no and started shaking his head. I told him I was at the hospital in severe pain on the previous Friday and they said I should never of been sent home and should have been examined. I was now too late for the methotrexate injection and I was told I was to come back at 7am for emergency surgery as they needed to remove the fetus and my tube which was very enlarged. I was told this would just be a day case and I would be home by late afternoon. I went home that night devastated as I had been enduring pain and emotional stress for 3 weeks before it come to this even though I stated from day 1 that I was in an incredible amount of pain.\n\nDay 17 I arrived at 7am. I was given a form which asked if I wanted the hospital to incinerate the baby or I wanted it to be held to have a funeral. I took the form to sign and the lady that gave it to me looked at my notes and said Oh you don't need that form as it's not a miscarriage and then she took it away. My Mum come to wait with me and was waiting on the day unit until I returned from surgery. The operation was to take approximately 1 hour. I got taken down at and was wheeled in to theater half an hour later. 3 hours later I was told they were waiting for a bed to become available on the ward then I would be taken and kept in overnight. I then thought about my mum still waiting for me at the day surgery cubicle. I have been told by my mum and husband that no one knew what was happening with me after 3 hours they were not sure if I was still in theatre at was ill or had come out. My mum had tried asking but nobody knew where I was. My husband called the day unit 3 times after waiting 3 hours and was told on the 3rd time I was being kept in. My husband then contacted my mum who was still sitting by an empty bed awaiting her daughters return. \n\nAt 5pm I was taken to Corn Flower B ward where my mum, dad and husband were waiting for me. The next point of this letter is extremely hard to write. As I turned my head on my pillow I realized there was a specimen bottle next to my head. I picked it up thinking it must have been a urine sample and was going to place it on the table as I didn't want my sample next to my head. I looked in the bottle where I was to find my removed fallopian tube with my baby clearly visible to me stuck in the tube. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. There in front of my eyes was the baby that had just been taken away from me. You could clearly see it was a baby and it looked exactly like a 1st scan picture in real life. I was completely devastated. As were my family who couldn't quite believe it. My mum went and gave this back to a nurse and was apologized to.\nThe following day, a consultant come round to see me and apologized for the mistake that was made of the baby being left at my head. This just showed me what a huge mistake had been made as this is the 1st time I had seen this consultant and hadn't mentioned it. I was also told the tube had been leaking and was close to rupture before it was removed. Surely this should have been picked up on the Friday before when I came in as an emergency. If only they  had scanned me. The mistake of not looking at me further could have proved fatal for me.\n\nA nurse whose name is Lynn from the ward who I saw originally and she referred me to the consultant came to see me whilst I was in hospital as she see my name on a board and wanted to know how I was and what had happened. She couldn't believe I was sent home on the Friday and why did no one look at my notes. I had no answers for this. Lynn was brilliant to me during my time going through this trauma.\n\nBack home my mental health started to suffer. Every time I closed my eyes I could see the baby in the tube in a jar and started having a dream that they put the baby there next to me to keep it alive and I would soon be able to hold my baby. I was crying all the time and not sleeping at all. I carried on having the same dream every time I did try to nod off. Every time I closed my eyes I could see it. I started to become ill through stress and not sleeping. I was not talking or wanting to see anyone. On Day 31 I was still sobbing constantly and still having the same dream and not sleeping, I couldn't concentrate I couldn't watch the TV or read a book, I was literally staring into space, because of this. I made a doctor's appointment. The doctor prescribed sedatives and said if I feel no better in a few weeks come back and I will be referred for counselling. I started to sleep while still having the dream every night and being woken by it, at least I was getting 2-3 hours' sleep a night. I am still at the date of this letter mentally I am still finding day to day life hard to contend with. I came back to work on Day 45 to try and get a bit of normality back and to help my recovery. I seem to be sitting crying at my computer more than working. I think counseling is going to be the only way I can deal with the terrible thing that has happened. I do have an appointment with the nurse at my doctors as I have been told by my hairdresser how has 26 years' experience that I have the beginnings of alopecia caused by stress.", "Dear Sadperson\r\nI am so very sorry to read about the loss of your baby.

I was led to believe by the surgeon that the surgery was very minor and I would regain consciousness quickly and be out of hospital that day.\nThis was not the case!\nDuring my time after the operation I was left in the recovery room/ward (i'm not sure where or what this is) I lost 6 units of blood. What I don't understand is why after more than 2 hours of being in that room why nobody noticed I had lost all this blood and because of this was unconscious for a further 5 days. The doctor who delivered my operation and staff in that ward surely should have been checking my blood pressure and if I was bleeding from where the operation took place on my body? This is a lot of blood as i'm sure you will agree and because of this I was then on a life support machine for 4 days in intensive care and my wife was told by a friend of the family who worked at the hospital it was best for everyone to get up to the hospital. AKA I don't think your husband has long left! A nurse who worked in intensive care kept saying to my wife \u201che's a poor soul\u201d.  What information is that for my wife who was in bits and wanted to know why her husband who was meant to be in for a routine small piece of surgery was now critically ill.\nAnother thing I don't understand is why the doctor who performed my operation left for the night after my operation and did not check on me, my wife asked to speak to the doctor that night after and she was informed he was away for the night- surely it is your duty as a doctor to check on your patient before you leave for the night so you are in the utmost confidence you have done your job correctly? My wife was then told later that night, another doctor would be stopping the bleeding and transfused 6 units of blood, which because of this man I am alive today! Why did the doctor who performed the operation not do this?\nI then took pneumonia whilst in intensive care. Again something which I feel did not need to happen if the doctor had followed up with his patient and saw I was losing a lot of blood.\nWhen my wife would visit the hospital every waking minute she could, and was told every time she came up \u201che's just the same\u201d\u2026how is that giving my wife any information? She was in complete shock and all she ever heard was the night this happened to me she got sat down and got asked what do you want to happen? That was a no brainer! I was then transferred to another ward for 4 days and discharged where the nurses or doctors on that ward let me walk down to the front door and stand myself waiting on my wife and son picking me up. I would like to know why this happened. Surely after losing all that bloody, nearly being at deaths door somebody should have taken me down to the front door and waited with me.\nI am a tall sturdy man and left that hospital 2 stone lighter. I was a very fit man and enjoyed gardening, I now can't do this due to lack of strength. I now wake up during the night having terrible dreams of dying and for about a year after my operation I could hardly sleep because I was scared I wouldn't wake up. I am half the man I used to be physically and mentally which is frightening and I now would like some answers or advice on what I can do to take this further. I had no confidence to do anything about this until now.", "I felt i received appalling care from Malham House Community Mental Health Team.\nOn one occasion I called them in utter crisis - severe inner tension and impending doom. A Social Worker was annoyed with me as it was late afternoon on a Friday. Not surprisingly I spiraled even further down. An appointment with a Psychiatrist left my self esteem plummeting to dangerous levels as he flicked through my files without ever engaging in eye contact and seemed to resent my presence. I was given an off hand diagnosis by Psychiatric Nurse on my first ever visit - after speaking with him for thirty minutes - I didn't get out of bed for two weeks following this. I was told I could do better after an OT visited my messy flat and finally I was discharged whilst ill with severe ruminations extreme lack of self care and in a terrible state without any referral to community support.\nI was in a crisis state - my brain had no space for anything but repetitive ruminations, I had severe inner tension.\n", "Hi, this sound like its been a very disturbing and frightening experience for you and your wife.

On a recent visit one eye started to bleed following the injection and took some time to stop bleeding.

The post natal care, in my case, seemed to be non existent. I would rather give birth in the street than in that hospital again. \nI went into the ward in late morning and after 6 hours of contractions, I was bleeding quite heavily and severely vomiting. I was examined and told it was normal and to go home. Little did I know the midwife had missed vital signs that mine and my baby's lives were in danger. \nI returned to the hospital as I was in severe pain between contractions and bleeding even heavier. I was taken into a room with blood all over the floor, not a great start. I was examined and told everything was normal - however my baby's heartbeat was causing concern. It was monitored and then another midwife decided the monitor was picking up my heartbeat not the baby's. Oh how wrong, was she?\nI rapidly deteriorated but no one would help. The midwife was ignoring my pleas for help and didn't seem to know where any equipment was. Still vomiting and bleeding even heavier, I was asked if I could walk down to the delivery suite. \nEventually in the late evening, I was seen by a Dr who was so concerned that my baby's heartbeat was over 170, they pulled someone out of theatre and rushed me in. \nI was severely dehydrated and had a blood loss of over 2 litres. My baby's heartbeat dropped to below 40 and the situation had become critical.\nHad they listened to me 4 hours ago maybe my placenta wouldn't have abrupted and caused the blood loss and stress to my baby. \nAfter the c section, I was wheeled back to the delivery suite to be greeted by a midwife seemingly demanding I breastfeed my baby. I had been pumped full of drugs and suffered extreme dehydration, couldn't move and was barely able to talk.\nShe continually put pressure on me and refused to help me bottle feed my baby. This was the start of things to come. \nThe only pleasant midwives, in my experience, were the students. I discharged myself within 48 hours due to the poor treatment I received. \nTo name a few issues, I was shouted at, prescribed medication unsuitable for someone with Asthma and refused different pain relief for 36 hours, given a blood pressure test on an arm with a drip in it which exploded, stabbed in the arm with an injection with such force it instantly bruised, not shown where any facilities were, not given water as I was on a drip and apparently didn't need any more fluid.\nThe staff continually walked in my room without introducing themselves or explaining what they were there to do. I witnessed a midwife shout at another member of staff across my room and then she proceeded to speak badly of her in front of me. At no point was I shown how to change, dress or feed my baby. \nI could write so much more about my experience, but the bottom line is in my opinion people should not use the maternity services at this hospital. ", "A catastrophic chain of events led to my mother being unsafe at home and extremely depressed and unhappy. My mother was let down by a locally based domiciliary care agency who did not turn up at the designated times leaving my mother saturated in her own urine and very distressed.  When she contacted the call centre by pressing her alarm, she was attended by the local community support officer, the ambulance service and district nurse, all of whom expressed grave concerns about her personal welfare. As her daughter, I felt that I had an overwhelming duty of care to ensure that she was placed safely in familiar and welcoming surroundings.\nShrublands in the first instance provided respite care for her. When she was ready to return home, she was then presented with a satisfactory option of returning to Shrublands as a day client with wrap around care provided by Oxford Private Care. \nPlease note that it would benefit many other clients in need of help if you could publish this positive story. Asking for help does work.\n", "My daughter ( age 14 ) has a heart condition called Tetralogy of Fallots, a congenital heart defect that requires surgery soon after birth. She received two open heart surgeries, the final one being the repair. It is common knowledge amongst all medical professionals that fallots childrens need ongoing follow up cardiac care, as they will need further surgery later into adolescence/adulthood. They are also at risk of sudden death and arrhythmia. \nWe moved from the Highlands to Kent in the last 18 months, and 6 months ago my daughter for the first time started showing odd symptoms over a period of time. They were cumulative and one of the symptoms which concerned me was a discoloration around her mouth. It was grey/blue and although she didn't realise when it was happening, I felt that it was related to her heart condition. Other symptoms were swollen ankles, and fatigue, and so I decided it was time to go to the GP. We went three times in total and asked for a referral and despite knowing her heart condition, knowing that she would indeed need more surgery at some point, he said I was overreacting, and refused to refer me. \nI returned home quite at a loss, My daughter's symptoms were increasing and out of desperation I took her to A& E feeling sure that a registrar or someone would see that it was a dangerous game the GP was playing by not referring her. \nOn arrival, I described my daughter's symptoms, they commented on her swollen ankles in what seemed to be almost a laughing 'look at the size of them' way, gave her an ECG and in total I was seen by three registrars of different specialties. She was even taken up to the childrens ward for a couple of hours to see other medical staff. They told me they could hear a murmur and her ECG wasn't totally normal but they felt it safe to assume that this was all probably typical of a child with her disease. They didn't refer her to a cardiologist, told me nothing was wrong and discharged her.\nThe next morning I am in panic mode, that feeling when you know your child, you know something is dreadfully wrong, and the only people you can turn to have decided to take no notice. So a tearful me telephoned the secretary of the Paediatric Cardiac Surgeon who performed life saving open heart surgery on my daughter as a baby, and told her the events, my fears, and whether I could 'self refer' and get down to Bristol to have her looked at. She agreed immediately, and two weeks later I am travelling with my sick child across England to Bristol Childrens Hospital, and into the Cardiac Unit. \nMy daughter was reunited with her Cardiologist, and Surgeon. They performed an echocardiogram and an MRI. We discovered that the murmur that the staff I met at QEQM decided was harmless, the swollen ankles they seemingly laughed at, the abnormal ECG that they felt was 'probably to be expected' was actually severe right ventricular dilatation, with Pulmonary Valve incompetence. So severe were these two things, that she is having open heart surgery in 3 weeks time. She is on complete rest as her body can no longer cope with any exertion. The swollen ankles is pulmonary edema (water gathering around her heart and lungs) and her right ventricle is in heart failure. The dilatation of the right ventricle is now compromising the left pumping chamber as the right fills up with regurgitated blood from the leaking pulmonary valve. The tiredness, well, that one is obvious. .\nAs a non medical professional, I would like to think that if a child is brought in who is symptomatic, and has a well known serious heart disease, the time for apparently guessing a diagnosis is definitely not that time.\nHad I not called the Surgeon and Cardiac unit, I would be sat here now, with a very good chance that my daughter would have either have died from a heart fibrillation or sudden death. \nNow can someone please tell me where the doctors I met at QEQM trained? It seemed not one of them could speak english competently and clearly. Not one of them could understand that if you hear a heart murmur and see an abnormal ECG on a patient with a congenital heart defect who is symptomatic, that this is not normal and advice from a heart specialist should be sought in the first instance.\nThis is scary stuff and it makes me wonder how many other children could have been misdiagnosed in similar circumstances. I really need and intend to get answers, I can assure you.\nI am so angry.", "I am so sorry to read about this terrible situation that you and your daughter have been through.

She spent 8 hours in A&E. We then drove her back to the care home. \nThe next day she had another fall and her condition was worse and ambulance was called. She eventually had more X-rays of her hips and chest. We were told she would have her bloods done. However we were then told there was no need as they thought she was attention seeking and they also believed she had thrown herself on the floor. I told the nurse she was in a lot of pain in her chest. I was told there was nothing wrong as all X-rays were ok. We took her back to the care home. Her incontinence pad had not been changed all day in the hospital. \nThe next day we were called again to the home by the GP to be told she had seen the results of the X-ray and she was in the last stages of lung cancer. \n1 week later she had hours to live.

I found when I called the hospital in labour they were very helpful and ready for me when I arrived to give birth. I was in active labour so they did what the could to make my experience the best they could. The midwife that delivered my daughter was a brunette who I think was called Vicky. She was very bubbly and made my experience a lovely one despite having an episiotomy and my daughters heart rate dropping. She even asked for my daughters name to write in her book and when I was admitted to their ward in my second pregnancy she remembered us as came to see my daughter I give her a 10/10. \nMy second birth experience was also at the Manor so I was delighted to have the chance to Return to this hospital. However my second experience was nothing like the first. \nI find their antenatal clinic and staff were excellent but when I started suffering quite badly from Symphysis Pubis Dysfunction (SPD) I had to use their triage department. I felt the staff there were very rude to me and basically tried to send me home before properly even checking me over. I was in so much pain to the point I was light headed. They checked my blood pressure and it was high so they admitted me and gave me pain medication. My first night on the Primrose ward I felt the staff care was ok but after that I didn't find them very helpful at all.\nThe physio came to see me and confirmed I was given a Zimmer frame as she said it was one of the most severe cases if SPD she had seen. I could not walk without falling and had actually fractured my arm from falling the day I came to triage. \nI had to wait 2 days for my sister to come to have a shower as none or the midwives were prepared to help me at all. When I did eventually get in there my sister called them to ask if they could clean the bath as it was dirty. The midwife just walked off, we thought she was coming back but after waiting 20 mins she called them back and the midwife just shoved the cloth across the desk to her. We were appalled. \nI felt every doctor who saw me gave me different information and by the time I was discharged I couldn't be more happy. I was told I'd receive a call on the Monday with my physio appointment. No call. I called them and they had no idea who I was. I took two weeks of me suffering at home in pain before I could even sort an appointment date.\nFast forwarding now to when I was 35 weeks I was admitted once again for SPD as my physio wasn't happy sending me home after my appointment due to me nearly passing out twice and shaking and throwing up from the pain. I was told I could get to talk to the consultant but was sent home with no talk or appointment. By this point my mother in law who knows a lot of the doctors and consultants in this hospital due to her working with them previously she rang and got me an appointment straight away. \nI went on the Monday as scheduled to my appointment along with my 1 year old daughter in a lot of pain to wait hours and be told to come back next week as the consultant was in emergency surgery. I came away crying which lead to another angry call from my mother in law to actually find out the consultant was on annual leave for the whole week! By this point I felt they were just making a mockery of me I was so upset in a wheelchair with my 1 year old daughter I left the hospital gutted. The week after I went back with my mother in as and they tried the same thing but she was having none of it so we came away with a date if induction at 37 weeks pregnant.\nMy birth experience on the labour ward just upset me when I look back I don't like to think of it because it still upsets me. I spent 10 hours on delivery suite before I gave birth and the whole time I was refused pain relief being told I was not in labour. My contractions were clearly showing in the monitor every 1. 5 minutes but still I was refused a private room and pain relief as I was only 3 cm dilated. I had explained that I labour very quickly and with my daughter I shot from 4-10 in the space of about 3 minutes.\nI was told to go in the bath and my fiance sent home. I cried uncontrollably when they told him to leave as in knew my body and knew the baby was coming. I begged him not to leave but they kicked him out. \nAfter that everything happened so fast I don't remember much details apart from I had a sharp pain and my body started pushing. I was rushed into a private room and my the time I rolled on to the bed with one push he was out. My fiance was devastated and so was I, he had only reached the hospital escalators. I had a birth plan and he wanted to cut the cord but he missed it all. He was allowed back in to see me and our son while the midwives started cleaning the room for somebody else. \nI felt we were rushed out the room and then told we could stay in another room for 4 hours which would have been 2 am and then take him home even though we had no car seat on us. I refused and the midwife was quite insistent on us leaving. I refused to take my son home in what would have had to be a taxi at that time as family aren't local and have no car seat. With a huff we were told I could go home but my fiance was quite nastily told he had to leave after only holding his son for 10 mins and missing the birth. I did ask for help breastfeeding as it was offered to my the first time round and it didn't go well so I hoped to get the bond in right away. The midwife told me its not important at this stage and she had other things to do.\nI was admitted up to the ward then where I found the staff were surprisingly helpful and lovely. I asked for help and the lovely midwife in shift managed to help me and my son bond and I successfully breastfed him. She even came to help me when he wouldn't settle by walking him up and down the ward so I could try and sleep. I left the hospital the day after with very mixed opinions.\nI understand there are good and bad experiences in every hospital and I was unlucky and also fortunate enough to experience both.\nI feel that when the standard if service is bad it's really bad but then those few lovely midwives make up for it all. I will never EVER forget my experience with my son being made to feel like a nuisance just for being in labour and having no pain relief regardless of my pelvic problems, then my fiance missing the birth of our son but then I will never forget the amazing magical experience I had with my first.\nI'm unsure if I will be returning to this hospital again but thought I'd share my story for others unsure of their decision.", "Dear LoMay,\r\nMy name is Kim Lacey and I am the Clinical Service Manger for the team you refer to in your posting.

We feel the nursing staff overruled our wishes and had our Mother get out of bed, even when she was so unwell having had two collapsed lungs and recovered.\n \nWhen mum was able to get back in bed, I understand she used the support over her head to pull herself up, on doing so, she collapsed and died. I and my family are scared that too much pressure had been placed by the nursing staff on getting our Mum out of bed and that this would have made her very anxious and may have contributed to her efforts to overexert herself when getting back into bed. The lady opposite my Mother called to me and said, \u2018your mum put up a good fight this morning'.\n \nWhen I and my family arrived at the hospital it seemed to us no-one had the decency to come and talk to us about what had happened to our Mother especially when she was due to come home just days later.

I would be happy to hear from you again through Patient Opinion or you can go to the \u201cContact Us\u201d section of the NHS Lanarkshire website to see the other ways to get in touch www.nhslanarkshire.org.uk\r\nI hope any subsequent experiences with NHS Lanarkshire have been more positive.\r\nKind regards", "These notes are based on the observations and experiences of my sister, my niece and myself whilst our mother was in hospital over four months in 2013. We were regular visitors. I have reckoned up at least 26 different days of visiting, sometime twice a day, and my sister and niece visited on most days when I didn't.\nChronology\nMy mother was admitted to St Helier hospital in mid 2013 and spent three weeks on Care of the Elderly ward A6. The reason for admission was the rapid onset of a lack of mobility; she was also suffering from urinary incontinence and moderate dementia. Her lack of mobility led to her being doubly incontinent almost immediately.\nAs her mobility improved, she was released to home with increased care package.\nShe was readmitted via A&E after 10 days, again to ward A6 as she had again stopped walking. Her mobility and dementia commenced a rapid decline in hospital. After protracted negotiations with Sutton Social Services she was discharged to an excellent care home in September.\nShe passed away, in the care home, two weeks later from Alzheimer's dementia and a urinary tract infection.\nMum's treatment in hospital\nWe were asked about my mother's eating preferences \u2013 she had never liked soup or yoghurt, so requested that she should have alternatives. In spite of continually repeating this, she was still being supplied with soup and yoghurt, which mostly remained unconsumed, until she was discharged.\nThe hospital wouldn't syringe her ears \u2013 a procedure carried out by her GP regularly \u2013 hence her hearing became an issue and probably added to her increased withdrawal and isolation. The olive oil drops in evidence when she was first admitted had disappeared from view by the end of the third week (my sister tells me she found them her bedside cabinet, where they remained).\nMy niece cleaned and trimmed her fingernails on her visits \u2013 no attention seem to be paid to this or her toenails by the ward staff \u2013 they seemed to be happy to treat an ailment but not care for the patient. When it was confirmed that the hospital could not provide a chiropodist, it still took persistent questioning to find out if I could arrange an external chiropodist to visit. Her toothbrush remained in her bedside cabinet, apparently unused, throughout her stay. There is a lack of many of the support structures that would improve life for patients on the ward, except for hairdressing (paid for by the patient; but which strikes me as less important than some other aspects) but not general hair washing.\nThe tea lady told my sister that mum was quite chirpy in the morning when she was sitting up. However, on each of the few occasions she could visit at 2pm, the start of visiting, to try to see mum while still up she was already in bed and the notes said she was put back to bed at 2pm. This was also my experience \u2013 when arriving early for review meetings, mother was much brighter and sitting out of bed.\nVisiting is discouraged outside the published hours, although I was never challenged when attending meetings outside these. Surely in Mum's case it would have been beneficial for a relative to help at mealtimes?\nMother's deterioration was constant, with apparently no adjustment to care/treatment even when it became obvious to all that she was rejecting the drugs (spitting out pills and throwing away liquids), not drinking or eating properly, therefore becoming malnourished and losing weight. Despite her obviously losing weight (she was never overweight) over a period of many weeks, it was only on the day that agreement was finally reached on her care home place she had been placed on a drip, which kept her in hospital for another 3 days.\nUnderstanding the patient\nMy niece and her daughter witnessed mum's transfer from A&E to the ward. In her own words:\n\u201c We could hear grandmother screaming when we entered the ward. I could hear the nurses talking to her: the nurse said \"don't kick me or I'll kick you and stop being such a baby\" she also said don't bite or I'll bite you back\". At this point I intervened and explained I was her granddaughter and advised I had heard what they had said and that I didn't think what they had said was very nice. The nurse the nurse said \"well she was scratching biting and kicking\". I said that still doesn't excuse the way your talking to her she has Alzheimer's and is confused by what's going on and she has very thin delicate skin. I also explained that I had my daughter with me and we'd both found it very distressing the way that they were treating her.\nI helped calm grandmother down and they put her into the bed without saying anything more.\nI spoke to one of the nurses afterwards and said that it might have been useful to read her notes before they'd tried to transfer her. She said the notes hadn't yet come up from the previous ward. Considering she was being transferred to the elderly ward I would have thought they would be more used to dealing with Alzheimer's, confused, elderly, scared patients.\nI didn't make a formal complaint at the time as I could see from the faces of the nurses id confronted that I'd not made myself popular and I was worried that this may affect grandmother's ongoing care. \u201d\nThere appeared to be a general lack of understanding of the condition of most of the patients on the ward. The majority of patients, all elderly ladies, seemed to be suffering a degree of dementia, confusion and fright. A number of times staff were observed asking indirect questions of patients such as \u2018are you experiencing any discomfort' and \u2018when did you last have a bowel movement' \u2013 both of which were met with blank stares.\nMuch time of staff is spent writing in and reading the patients' folders \u2013 one at the end of the bed and the other kept in a \u2018locked' filing trolley (rarely actually locked). On approaching a bed, it is not immediately obvious what the patient's name or their state of health or mind is. This results in a blanket approach to all patients: as the staff and doctors seem to change rapidly they cannot quickly understand if the patient hasn't heard, doesn't understand or is ignoring questions or requests; all of which I observed with my mother.\nIn order for staff to quickly identify with patients' condition, needs and communication abilities there should be a very clear and obvious statement their abilities and requirements at the bedside \u2013 presumably in the bedside folder \u2013 rather than the opaque tick lists (which I managed to find hidden amongst the many pages of records in the bed folder) or in many pages of handwritten script in remote folders. Why are patient's names not in plain view at the bed?\nPatients have a large orange call button to press if they need help. My mother didn't understand what this was, could not physically press it herself and when I operated it (whilst in a separate bedroom for MRSA cleansing) it was 9 minutes before anyone came.\nPatient Information Station\nOn the ward there is a large illuminated sign by a cell of desks with a \u2018Patient Information Station' sign. Often there doesn't seem to be anyone there to ask questions \u2013 and even if there is, if you don't interrupt someone you are ignored. Quite commonly you are asked to wait for someone else to (not) answer your questions or wait while the \u2018secret folder' is pored over for any useful information, usually with little success.\nMy sister reports: we never received a missing discharge letter from the first three week stay \u2013 it was requested by the GP and social services. I asked several times and I stood at the \"station\" for about 10 minutes one day while one of the nurses tried to find it, first in the secret files then on the computer, when eventually she said she had found it, between two of them they couldn't work out how to print me out a copy, eventually they agreed to sort it out later and post it to me and it never arrived.\nWhen supplying information or making a request on the patient's behalf it is written in the folder \u2013 my experience was that this is never actioned \u201cCan you arrange for my chiropodist for my mother? \u201d was written in the book twice \u2013 eventually, when asked, the house doctor spent 10 minutes finding the sister to get the answer that the hospital can't arrange that.\nThere seems to be no strategy for communication with relatives/carers. It was very difficult to find out anything about mum's treatment, diagnosis or condition. There are no doctors available during evening visiting hours which is when working relatives can attend. It seems a different model of ward is required for those unable to communicate for themselves.\nWard Staff\nIn spite of printing out the uniforms section from the hospital website, it was nearly impossible to identify the level of nursing staff and identify a doctor. Many of the nursing staff in dark blue uniforms referred me to another in the same uniform when I requested information \u2013 even when at the \u2018Information Station'.\nI found the attitude of many of these nurses towards me to be intimidating, as if I were a nuisance getting in the way. In one instance when asking a question the answer was so grudgingly given as to be positively rude. Often they did not engage with the patients, not introducing themselves or even saying hello when approaching the patient, for whatever reason. Many had thick foreign accents which exacerbated understanding difficulties, adding to the issues most of the patients had in coping with their situation.\nA quote from my niece \u201c\u2026on one occasion the bed smelt of faeces and there was some on her hands, sheets and in her nails. I asked the nurse to clean her up and she said she was dealing with another patient first. I was there for a good 20 minutes before she came to sort her out. She looked at Diddy and said \u2018oh it's her I'll need to get some help with this one'. I had to leave at that point while the nurse went to find another nurse. I overhead the other nurse say I've got the medication to give out she'll have to wait.\nIt shocked me that often in the evening there would only be 2 nurses on ward for all the high dependent patients they needed to care for\u201d\nThere was never a sense of business on the ward. Things were done slowly and intentionally: reading files, walking about with bits of paper, looking for someone, talking on the telephone. The atmosphere from these nurses generally was one of resentful tolerance of visitors and patients. The more junior staff on the ward had a more caring attitude and seemed to be the people doing all the real care work.\nAt, I assume, shift handover time (during evening visiting hours) a group of four or five nurses in dark blue uniforms would drift along the foot ends of beds and discuss, with reference to a single sheet of paper, presumably, the patient in the bed. The patient was rarely acknowledged and I certainly wasn't. A thoroughly depressing experience (with all the writing and reading of the \u2018secret' folder, why is that not used at this point? )\nDoctors are indistinguishable from visitors, making a meaningful interaction with them difficult. The patients appear to be attended to by a small team of unidentified doctors at any one time \u2013 the only name generally offered was that of the consultant, whom I managed to talk to on the phone but never saw on the ward. I did have a deep conversation with a doctor after she visited the bed, when I had offered some information on my mother. However, I only saw this lady once or twice again. My mother asked me on more than one occasion \u2018who's that' when a doctor was trying to elicit information (or blood) from her.\nMood on the ward\nThere was generally a feeling of depression in the ward. Very few of the patients were capable of reading and were not encouraged to engage with each other in any way. The only entertainment provided was via the \u2018pay to view' TV system, which supplied free BBC radio stations and the hospital radio channel \u2013 which played a selection of mostly pop music. However, given the age and abilities of the patients, none of them were, as far as I could tell, capable of operating the system. Indeed I had to help one of the staff turn the radio on for a patient. The pay to view TV, apart from the appalling expense (\u00a310 for 24 hours from when bought), was difficult for my daughter, who is very IT literate, to operate.\nThis resulted in a very sterile social and sensory environment \u2013 further adding to the isolation, confusion and anxiety of the patients.\nPatients would recover more quickly and be more cooperative if they could feel happy in their environment. A central entertainment system, with communal TV and music appropriate to the age group would help this, as would a form of social interaction between patients and staff.\nVisitors, who could make a difference to the atmosphere, are not encouraged. There are no facilities on the ward \u2013 I could not find water tap or visitor toilet, I was never once offered a drink, even when they were being provided to the patients. The coffee bar is eight minutes and the shop six minutes walk from the ward, down and six floors. A long time away in a 2 hour visiting slot.\nThe hospital website states \u2018Visiting is restricted to 2. 30pm - 5pm and 6pm - 8pm to allow time for patient care and meal times', but patient care seems to carry on in visiting times and help at mealtimes could be useful (as above), so why be so restrictive?\nWith the feeling and approach of the staff on the ward, we were worried that complaining formally during her stay would further prejudice the staff attitude to my already very vulnerable mother. I did approach the PALS service at the very beginning of her first stay (about the sombre mood of the ward and the TV system) but could not structure my further comments in order to approach them further.\nThe contrast with the care home was stark and shocking: a happy, vibrant atmosphere, with music, chatting and many caring staff - I only managed to visit twice (no restriction on visiting hours and happy to let me help with meals) \u2013 both times I was asked if I'd like a drink and it was bought to me.\nOther points\nI witnessed some records, notably those pertaining to meals and position in/out of bed, being updated after the event. Two days' records missing one day and filled in the next.\nThe \u2018patient information'/nurses station was extremely cluttered with signs/notes/posters stuck on the walls and windows \u2013 some of which were two years out of date. Many of these were reminding staff of tasks which would appear to be a normal part of their responsibilities. This added to the gloomy and unstructured feeling of the ward.", "On a Saturday recently my friend rushed me to A&E. I had a severe headache, had been vomiting non stop all day, was shaking uncontrollably. I could barely keep my eyes open due to the pain that lights were causing me and was struggling to walk. \nMy friend (who works in the hospital) knew that there was something seriously wrong however on arrival at A&E she tried to explain my symptoms to be stopped and told that 'its not really appropriate for A&E'. \nShe was then handed a leaflet about NHS24 which the receptionist explained was the procedure she should follow next time. We were then pointed a room to call NHS24 as the receptionist claimed there was no way she could get my details on the system unless we called them - complete nonsense. \nAs my friend called NHS24 I continued to vomit all over the floor as we hadn't even been given a bucket even though she had tried to tell them I was being sick all day long. After 30 minutes we were then allowed to sit in the A&E waiting room for about an hour before being seen. \nThankfully the doctor that saw me identified in less than 15 minutes that I likely had meningitis and I was rushed up to admissions to receive treatment. It seems that going to A&E really was appropriate considering how ilI was. With my temperature being at 40 by the time I was able to be seen, the time wasted calling NHS24 was not needed. \nLuckily, on this occasion, a patients life was not severely affected but I fear that in future this could very well happen if reception staff are not trained on how to deal with people that arrive. To also make blatant lies about not being able to get my details on the system unless I called NHS24 was utterly inappropriate and the member of staff I feel has been negligent in their behaviour on this occasion. \nPeople do not arrive at A&E to be judged - perhaps if this happened any other night than a Saturday night I would have been treated with a bit of care and concern. \nIt was lucky my friend was able to take me to A&E and call NHS24, if I had to go on my own I would simply not have been able to call them - I was seriously ill. In this scenario are patients just told to leave because their illness 'isnt really appropriate for A&E'? Other than this my stay in hospital went well. Both doctors and nurses provided a high level of care and put me at ease throughout my illness.", "Dear Pr0spect\nWhat a frightening experience for you or anyone to have to go through.

I was told that I would have a named nurse to support me and draw up a care plan and also a daily 1-2-1 with a nurse on duty. \nThis is what actually happened. My named nurse would have a brief chat with me while passing me in a corridor and would always promise to draw up my care plan the next time she was on duty as she was too busy now. I finally received my care plan a few days before being discharged. I was in hospital for 4 weeks. \nA list would be put up in the dining room informing patients who their 1-2-1 would be with each day. I actually received three 1-2-1's during my stay as the nurses always said they were too busy. This didn't actually bother me as I was too depressed to want to talk anyway. However I did witness other patients crying and distressed, begging for a nurse to talk to which I found horrendous and inhumane. \nI felt my consultant who I saw once a week would speak down to me and seemed to treat me like some kind of naughty school child. During 1 meeting, I was so anxious that I could not speak as my mouth became so dry. When I said that I needed a glass of water, my consultant told me that I should have had 1 before the meeting.\nA couple of the nurses were nice and supportive but the majority did not seem to be in the slightest bit interested in providing the required care and support of which they are trained and paid to do so. I was even called a stupid cow by 1 of the night nurses and subjected to constant threats of having personal items taken away from me. Overall I found my whole experience at PHC extremely distressing and unhelpful and was made to feel like I was there as a punishment rather then treatment.", "I am very sorry for your sad loss and for the experiences you have described during your stay at PHC.

What she was subjected to was in my opinion one of the most disgusting and inhumane experiences in her life. She was in recovery on an inpatient ward after an operation. The surgeon was absolutely fantastic, and the operation was a success. The aftercare however was something I wouldn't put my pet dog through.\n\nShe was subjected to lack of care and due attention by a particular nurse and to call her a nurse would be a stretch of the imagination. My mother was kept on morphine and sleeping for large amounts of her time in the ward. My mother overheard her speaking and belittling her to the other nurses and saying- I don't understand people how have legs and the means to walk, and chose not to. She then instructed other nurses to not walk my mother to the shower room as it was too much effort to use the harness, and to just give her a bed bath. When the care assistants asked,shouldn't we walk her to the shower? , they were instructed by the nurse to do as they were told.\n\nBeing an independent woman, and always on her feet, she found the morphine overbearing and just needed a little help to walk. From walking up to the shower room before her operation, she was left weaker and unable to walk just 7 days later from lack of fluids, food (from not being able to settle her vomiting) and constantly being given morphine as a panacea for all her requests for relief.\n\nMy mother then had a UTI and asked for antibiotics, as the pain was unbearable. The pain was so severe, that my mother was shouting out her own mothers name whilst in pain. We then called a nurse, who sent a care assistant 20 mins later. They said they couldn't do anything as it was beyond their jurisdiction. They then called the same nurse in question and asked my mum why didn't she just have the morphine when she was told earlier. My mum responded that she wasn't in pain then. She then asked how long the results of her urine test would take to come back. The nurse completely disregarded this and said, you should have taken the morphine when we told you. My mother asked her, how long the morphine would last as she was given 2. 5ml earlier, to which the nurse responded, I don't know, we just give it when you need and everyone is different.  My mother asked what time the last sub cut was given, to which the nurse responded I don't know, I'll just give you another 2. 5ml. When asked shouldn't she investigate the cause of the pain, she responded, no, pain is our first attention, the rest just follows.\n\nFinally, before her transfer to Charing Cross hospital, my mother was inspected by a doctor, who was shocked to see that her stitches had not been removed as instructed three days prior. \n \nMy mother then said that the wound should be dressed as it starting oozing and seeping as she was on blood thinners, and the heal time takes longer. The nurse who was fully aware responded that there is no need for a dressing, it will stop itself. As a consequence, her nightdress stuck to her skin.\nOn transferring her to Charing Cross, the nurse and doctor were horrified at her treatment, wounds, and the fact there she was not given her afternoon medicine on handover. They said it was fundamental nursing to dress a wound to stop infections. My mother then burst into tears, and she was consoled by the doctor and nurse in charge, and was assured that her care was now the upmost priority. My mother said she wasn't lying as she wants to walk and get better, and proof was there for everyone when the physiotherapist in Charring Cross helped my mum walk with a frame in that week for 3 days in a row.\nAs a nurse with 45 years experience, and working and paying tax in the UK for 40 years, she was shocked at her ordeal. Is this the standard bearing care and support from our \u2018flagship' NHS?\n\nMy mother has recently passed away due to Cancer which she has been fighting for the last eight months. It is upsetting and horrendous that she had to face such an ordeal in her last few weeks of life. My feeling is that I am utterly disgusted that this person is allowed to practice as a nurse, let alone have verbal contact with patients. People are in hospital because they are sick or trying to recover, away from their families and familiar surroundings. To have to be faced with someone who calls themselves a nurse that is in my view inconsiderate, with no empathy, sympathy or even a shred of emotion should not even be allowed.

It is always difficult to persuade the service to come and assess the patients.\nThey will flatly refuse to see a patient unless they are \"medically fit\", irrespective of the Royal College of Psychiatry guidelines which state that patients who have medical problems which do not affect their mental state are fit to be assessed. The service will often insist over the phone that our patients are \"not medically fit\" despite senior A&E clinicians who have physically seen and examined the patient deeming them to be medically fit. In my opinion it is absolutely unprofessional to draw such a conclusion over the phone without having seen the patient, especially when a senior clinician experienced in the relevant field has deemed so otherwise.\nYesterday I had a psychotic patient expressing clear delusions, with a history of psychiatric admissions, who was established on a atypical antipsychotic so was highly likely to be known to the local Mental Health service. After establishing that the patient was medically fit via an extensive examination and review of blood tests, I contacted the service. \nI was told that \"we can't look up any information because our computer system is broken\". I was rung back an hour later being told that \"we're not coming to assess the patient because we think it's probably a UTI\". \nThey had not seen the patient, had not taken a history and had not consulted the blood results. I had to divert staff from a serious case in the Resuscitation room to obtain an unnecessary urine dip, to prove to Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Trust Access and Assessment Service that my patient was not suffering from a UTI. The urine dip was negative, so I rang the service back and after some resistance got them to agree to assess the patient. Upon arriving, they then decided to send the patient home and assess them the following day instead.\nThe service staff I have met have come across as bone-idle and obstructive. They have discounted expert opinion from other senior clinicians in order to avoid having to come and assess patients. They have asked for extra unnecessary tests to be performed to delay having to come out. \nI have never had a helpful experience when referring patients.", "My dear friend is now very unwell with Leukaemia and when last weighed was 3 Stone 4 pounds. She is unable to move from her couch and is in constant pain. Her late husband abused her over many years but was particularly good friends with her GP and discussed her care multidisciplinary care plan before he died of an alcohol related illness. For some reason she has been put on a violent patient scheme but has never been assessed or given any treatment. She now can barely eat and drink and has apparently gastroenteritis although that is not a confirmed diagnosis but I would expect this is a symptom of her illness. Unfortunately it is unlikely she will live a great deal longer.\nWhat is sickening is that her GP refuses to visit her, she has no services or equipment and she is being refused any direct medical assistance and she is powerless to change her GP because of this status she has been given. She is very bright and astute and clearly desperate for some palliative care. A woman who has given her life to helping others should not be treated in this way in her last few weeks or months.", "I feel my dad was let down badly by the treatment for his lung cancer.\nWhen he was diagnosed he was told it was not possible to operate and he then had to wait for a further appointment to discuss his options.\nThis took a few weeks and I accompanied him during this visit. We were advised the next appointment would be with an Oncologist, who could discuss with us the possibility of Chemo or Radiotherapy to help reduce the tumor. I felt we were treated like a number and when I asked why it was not possible to operate - I was not told that it was because dad was not fit enough but that 'we just don't do that when we are unable to cure the patient'.\nDad then had to wait more weeks and in the end he actually passed away before he even saw the Oncologist.\nI even asked our local GP to chase the appointment and called Raigmore to also chase but as the Oncologist was on holiday no one could see my dad to help.\nI feel that if we had been seen quicker and possibly offered radiotherapy my dad would have had a slightly longer time with us.\nWhen he did pass away we had no MacMillan Nurse and no support and we ended up caring for dad until his last with the support of the local Paramedic Team - who I have to say were brilliant.\nSince then I know of other patients with the same diagnosis as my dad was given who have been lucky enough to have seen the Oncologist and have been offered treatment.

My antenatal care was fantastic- ended up having a crash section as my PET was dangerous and my and baby's heart rates became critical. Baby delivered at 32 weeks - spent 4 weeks on NICU where the team were simply amazing and baby is now fine. \nHowever I found my post care at ASPH Joan Booker ward horrendous. I was placed back on a ward with pregnant ladies when my baby was in intensive care even though there were side rooms available. I was not given painkillers when I repeatedly requested them. I was discharged after 3 days with a pack of beta blockers and told to see my GP for my 6 week check at the appropriate time. \nHowever I started feeling strange last week. My baby is now 5 weeks old. I went to my GP who was disgusted as apparently I should have had PET checks for two weeks from my midwife. No one ever contacted or came to see me. Now I have post partum pre-eclampsia and my GP is worried I may have long lasting damage.", "I'm sorry you still have outstanding issues regarding your mum's care. Please can you contact our PALS team (pals@srft.nhs.uk) with yours and your mum's details so we can look into this for you.", "My partner saw two different GPs at our local practice, with a six month gap in between with diarrhea, weight loss and blood in his stool. His symptoms were dismissed as minor, no further investigations were ordered, and so his condition was left for a full year before a proper diagnosis was made. He was finally taken more seriously, and urgently referred to hospital for more tests. However, by this time he had stage 3 bowel cancer, and after chemotherapy and two major surgeries he died seven months later. He was 28.\nThe first GP diagnosed a \u201clikely internal pile\u201d with no onward referral for investigation. They advised my partner to return if \u201c++ bleeding/pain/masses\u201d. This advice was not very helpful and I feel he should have been told to return if bleeding persisted at all, heavy or not. As it was he felt the small amount of blood found in his stools over the next few months was nothing to worry about.\nHe returned for the second visit 6 months later regarding his ongoing diarrhea and bleeding. He had lost more weight and was experiencing significant pain. The doctor noted that my partner thought he had IBS because a sibling had the same condition, and prescribed Fybogel and suggested a food diary to find trigger foods. The doctor did not carry out any examination to check whether my partner's layman's self diagnosis was accurate, no ongoing monitoring was discussed, nor were any further investigations requested. My partner was left feeling that his condition was not medically significant and he should not worry about it.\nIt was not until he saw a third doctor and presented with emergency symptoms of anaemia and a raised temperature that he was rushed to hospital where they carried out a colonoscopy and after a month's stay discovered he had bowel cancer, which was so advanced it had eaten through his bowel wall. An operation was carried out to remove a section of his bowel and he came home after a further month's stay. He then saw an oncologist who recommended 6 months worth of treatment but the cancer returned within 4 months with metastasis to the liver and abdomen. A second operation was carried out somewhat successfully but the cancer continued to spread and my partner tragically lost his life in November at a local hospice.\nI feel that there were missed opportunities by the GPs for monitoring and further investigations which could have picked up the cancer in its much earlier stages when it may well still have been survivable.\nIt is not my intention to make trouble for the GPs involved or to ask for compensation. I feel very strongly that my partner's relatively early age at onset is what left him undiagnosed: I fear his GPs assumed that he was too young to have bowel cancer and dismissed this possible diagnosis when making their differential diagnoses. I have heard lots of similar stories about other people being misdiagnosed due to their age too. Maybe GPs need to make onward referrals for colonoscopy, or at the very least make a monitoring plan for patients with a similar presentation so that further possible unnecessary deaths are prevented in the future as bowel cancer is a curable disease if caught early enough.\nI believe these safeguards need to be put in place urgently to help stop this awful loss from happening again to another family. Clinical guidelines for younger people with cancer symptoms are needed urgently.", "I'm very sorry to hear about your experience here.

However, we are disappointed and concerned to hear that your experience of our post-natal ward was poor.\r\nWhilst we appreciate it is very difficult for mothers with babies going to NICU, all women (following a caesarean section) will need to be initially cared for in the dedicated ward bay following surgery. This is for safety reasons and so close observations can be carried out. However, we endeavour to move women in your situation to their own room as quickly as possible once they are stable and a side room is available. We apologise if you felt there was a unnecessary delay in this taking place.\r\nWithout knowing the full details of when you stayed with us it is difficult to comment, but we have made recent improvements to distributing pain killers on the ward. We now run four hourly drug rounds and if a woman misses the round for any reason (such as visiting their baby in NICU) they can ask their nominated named midwife to give the medication separately. We hope this will improve the process for women in our care and ensure that everyone on the ward receives painkillers in a timely way.\r\nAgain, it is difficult to comment specifically without reviewing your notes, but we are sorry the care you received after discharge was not better planned. Sometimes if a woman is visiting her baby in NICU and unlikely to be at home for the community midwife to visit for postnatal checks, we will arrange for the follow-up appointments to take place on Joan Booker Ward instead. Usually we would \u2018handover' the care of women who have experienced high blood pressure (as part of pre-eclampsia in pregnancy) to their GP two weeks after discharge and any further checks would take place through the GP surgery.\r\nOverall, we are sorry that some aspects of the care we provided fell short and I would welcome the opportunity to discuss everything with you in more detail.

It just felt really inappropriate. \nLater on the ward I was left haemorrhaging for many hours and was left alone in the bathroom despite already having fainted twice from loss of blood.

This to the people who knew him was a red flag, we all knew he was in the early stages of infection.\r\nOn the Sunday we were called in by staff asking if someone could come in and calm my Dad down as he was very agitate, we took it in turns to sit with him over a 12 hour period and we only saw a student nurse come in on 3 occasions, each time we pleaded with them to find someone who could start him on antibiotics or do something knowing it was going to only get worse. It had been over a week since he had gone in and every time we asked if it was possible to see a Dr, each time we were told that the Dr's were very busy and couldn't come to see us.\r\nMonday and Tuesday had gone by and my Dad still hadn't been started on any medication, we got told on Tuesday that he had a fall the night before, he was hallucinating and was really confused. Anyone who knew my Dad knows that when he is well he's sharp as a tack but with him being put on 5a which is a ward for the elderly I got the feeling the staff just saw him as a confused old man. I went to see the PALS team on the Wednesday in the hope that they could put me in touch with a Dr and they said they would get me an appointment for the Thursday afternoon.\r\nAs I got to the hospital at 3pm a Dr was waiting at my Dads door to talk to me, they sat me down and told me he had a seizure in the morning and they had managed to get him stable, he told me that he had an infection and they had started him on antibiotics that afternoon, my Dad died at 4. 30 that afternoon...\r\nI should point out my Dad had many health problems and had he beaten this infection the next one may of beaten him. All I wish is that he had been given a fighting chance!", "Dear Relative676,\r\nFirstly, may I offer my sincere condolences for your sad loss.

From here she was sent AMU and from there to ward 8. My wife is unable to communicate and make requests for help.\nI have provided a folder with background information to help nursing staff. This includes a list of medication that is required at different times during the day. I have also provided the medication\nPoint 1 - my wife has remained in the same bed and not moved or showered throughout. Her teeth have not been cleaned. I have a concern about my wife's posture in bed from an aspiration view point and her skin condition due to lack of bathing and creaming\nPoint 2 - on visiting her at 13.00 I noticed that she had soiled herself in an open pad. I asked a nurse to check. I then notice that due to the inappropriate routing of her peg that it was covered in feces. The nurse said she would log this, cleaned my wife up but left the peg routed under her nightie. I pointed out the safer route is via the neck opening in the nightie. This needs to be recorded as my wife could well develop additional problems due to bad practice i.e. inappropriate pads being used or inappropriate routing of the peg. What I also expect to happen is that the Y adapter is changed and the peg checked by a professional\nPoint 3 - my wife has not been given much of her medication. This needs to happen as indicated. Medication documentation have been lost, duplicated and recovered. This clearly needs to be reviewed as my wife's condition requires regular use of the medication. I have done what I can to provide medication and tables for when and what to administer. I have also attended the hospital for prolonged periods (All day Saturday, Half day Sunday, Half day Monday). \nI always have my mobile with me to answer questions. My fear is what happens when I do not visit i.e. my wife cannot say \"I need the toilet\" or \"It's time for my Medication\" or \"Don't put my peg feeding tube up my nightie.\u201d\nDue to my wife's illness, it's highly likely she will need the services of the hospital in the future.

She had complex health needs, was 23 years old and ventilator dependent. As her mother I was also her main carer, she was transfered from another hospital as an emergency with a blocked shunt and was unconscious. She went straight to theatre, then to intensive care. She still remained unconscious and prognosis was dire. I was only allowed to visit during the five hours visiting time, despite being with her usually as her carer 24 hours. There were no chairs for visitors, I had to ask for an air mattress for her, this wasn't supplied for 30 hours. We were never spoken to by a senior neurologist, her drain in her head stopped working and I had to ask staff repeatedly to call a doctor. When a junior Dr did eventually come and confirm this they gave us an option of doing nothing about it. On the second day there (my daughters last) I took photographs of her, only to be stopped by a nurse because my daughter hadn't consented! However no one actually asked me about her care or medication or legal status as we parents both had lasting power of attorney. I followed a member of the public in one visiting time and the curtains were drawn around my daughters bed, I went in to find a nurse taking a photograph of my daughters five year old pressure sore, who consented for this to be taken? Her gown that she left her previous hospital wearing was not changed during her two and a half days, she was freezing to touch and when I pointed this out the nurse reluctantly agreed and went to find a bear hugger, coming back to say they were all in use! I slept on a bench in the relatives room for the two nights, only to have the lights put on full and all the windows thrown open by a very rude domestic at 6: 45 am who told me and another relative with a dying husband to get out of the room. Even though my daughter was dying no allowances were made for me to be there, the nurse in charge said they could not set a precedent otherwise all relatives would want to be there. Luckily the Lane Fox unit were happy to have my daughter transferred back to them where she had a dignified death surrounded by staff who cared.", "My first mmc happened in March 2013 and I can't complain about how I was treated other than that when I had to go in to the epu for a confirmation scan, I was seated in a waiting room with happily expecting mums to be with heavily pregnant women wondering past.\nMy second mmc was discovered at the beginning of December and was made even more of a nightmare by how I was treated and the horrendous following weeks.\nAt the beginning of December, I went in to the epc for a routine scan only to be told that our beautiful baby had passed away around a week before. We were given the whole yarn about how miscarriage is very common, which I personally find very heartless. I didn't care about how common it is, I was devastated that it had happened to us!\nI was already well informed about our options because of our first mmc and chose to have an erpc. (I hate that term. This was our baby! Not a \"product\" of conception! Smm is much more tactful and should be more widely used).\nBecause our scan was on a Friday, we had to wait till Monday for the surgery. I was on edge and basically terrified that things would happen naturally in this time but in the end they didn't.\nWhen I went in for surgery on the monday I had to sit, crying and in obvious distress in a full waiting room of other people before the surgeon saw me for the pre-op questions stuff. He was flustered and covered in beads of sweat and the first thing he said to me was \"So you're in for a caesarian today then? \" I don't have words for how hurtful this was and it made me doubt the surgeons capabilities, but I so just wanted to get the physical aspect out of the way I just tried to push the concerns out of my head.\nAfter the surgery, while I was groggy and in so much pain I had been administered morphine, the surgeon came to tell me that I had \"lost more blood than they had hoped\". Though it wasn't explained why or what this meant/impacted etc. I was too 'out of it' to question this at the time.\nFollowing the surgery I developed a post op infection and a uti, despite my impeccable personal hygiene and following the scant aftercare advice I had been given to the letter. For the first ever time in my life I was prescribed antibiotics which made me very confused, suppressed my appetite, gave me diarrhea and vomiting and kept me awake at night.\nAround two weeks after the surgery, the hospital rang to tell me that they had tested what they had taken out of me but weren't able to detect any pregnancy tissue at all! They were telling me that the surgery was a complete failure. Not only that, but they were going to keep me waiting a whole week before they could fit me in for a scan and that said scan would be on Christmas eve.\nI was pretty certain that I hadn't miscarried naturally since the surgery and so had to cope with the thought that I had been carrying around our dead child inside me for weeks and that I had been through surgery for nothing. I also had the overwhelming fear that if something was found to still be present when I was scanned, then I would have to undergo a mva under only local anaesthetic.\nOn Christmas eve we had to wait in a waiting room with women waiting for their 12 week scans with heavily pregnant women from the maternity wing above wondering past. By the time we finally got in called in for our appointment, 2 1/2 hours late, I was a nervous wreck!\nThe scan itself showed that there was nothing in my uterus. The sonographer and the gynecologist present believe that the erpc/smm had actually been successful but that the lab had tested the wrong part of what was taken from me!\nAll of that stress, worry and fear all because they didn't think to carry out their test on another part of what they had taken from me! ? !\nFollowing this scan, it was a further two weeks before the hospital would release our babys remains to the funeral directors so that we could have a funeral and say our goodbyes properly.\nSince this ordeal, I have been having difficulties with anxiety and mood swings. I barely sleep and generally feel like I'm not coping very well. I've been to my gp about this, hoping that I could be referred to a counsellor. My gp told me how common mc is (because that heartless, meaningless rubbish never gets old! ) and that it can take a while to feel better afterwards. I was basically being told that I don't know myself and am not qualified to say that I don't feel right.\nI will be making a formal complaint to our local hospital trust when I am feeling stronger. There are so many aspects concerning the \"care\" I received that I object to that it is difficult to know where to start!\nThere have been some wonderfully caring and compassionate caregivers that we have encountered through this whole thing, but unfortunately, their goodness does not cancel out all of the painful, nightmareish hell that was inflicted upon us by so many others.", "We do take any concerns about patient care seriously.

Whereupon the ICU consultant informed us over my wife's bed in an open ward that they (the MDT) were placing my wife on the 'Liverpool Care Path'. We were subsequently moved to a private medical facility, where my wife spent six months in rehabilitation.\nI raised a complaint via PALS which the trust acknowledged. A meeting was arranged and the outcome was, in the words of the ICU consultant assigned to the case: 'As a result of a botched transfer, no outreach staff were on duty to accommodate J's needs'.\nI had before the meeting started, requested that I be allowed to record the meeting both audio and video. I had the equipment with me. I was advised by the PALS coordinator that the meeting was being recorded both audio and video and that I would receive a full transcript. She even showed me the glowing lights on the equipment to emphasise the equipment was 'on and working'. \nTwo days after the meeting, I received a telephone call to apologise that the equipment was in fact faulty and had not been working. The resulting written response did not reflect what we had discussed and the agreements we had made. It was a watered down version, making no mention of the 'botched transfer'.\nI feel as though I have been lied to, and taken as some sort of idiot.

When seen by the doctors I was discharged despite being in a lot of pain and having breathing difficulties.\nOn discharge the nurses disagreed with the doctors on my condition and gave me morphine as I was in agony. I was taken out in a wheel chair as I could not breathe.\nI went home and my family were so concerned they ran the emergency GP who took one look at me and sent me back to hospital, I chose to go to Sheffield this time and they found I had Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome which, seemingly, I could have died from if I had been left much longer.

He was at A & E and then MAU then transferred to ward 41. My brother was only 50 yrs old. While in hospital he lost his sight, went deaf and over a course of 5 weeks and 4 days he did not know us and lost the ability to know how to eat drink and also he could not walk. They treated him for meningitis and also methanol poisoning which was never there, also cjd and they could not find out what was wrong. However the care and compassion were not there. Also we were not consulted regarding his treatment despite my brother not knowing what was happening to him. He had countless falls as he did not know he could not walk in the end. \nHe was moved to CCU for the last 3 days of his life and then we were told he may have malignant meningitis 40 minutes before he died. They were supposed to implement a red tray for food as he could not see or hear and also a commode to use. Despite the doctor saying it would be put in his notes, it never was. It also took us nine days to get a appointment to speak to the doctor on the ward as they also did a clinic as well as the ward and could not be disturbed. We feel our brother was let down by the care and attitude on the ward and will be speaking to someone to explain what happened to our brother.", "Through the previous use of one of the SLAM Trust's mental services in Croydon, for treatment for anxiety and depression problems, between late 2012 and early 2013 I was put into the position of having little choice other than to cease contact with this service, due to unacceptable ways I was being treated as a patient/service user/customer and informal attempts to resolve this problem going nowhere. Ever since lodging my formal complaint early last year, when it came to almost everything I had to raise, the senior manager in charge of investigating my complaint treated me extremely unfairly/unacceptably (probably because part of my complaint was in connection with an unacceptable letter which had been signed by the person just before I lodged the complaint). \nWhen I raised this situation to the attention of the Trust's Chief Executive it made no difference. Because it repeatedly happened staff members were not coming back to me on a timely basis, when I was writing this Trust relevant letters, I was put into the position of having to contact the Parliamentary Ombudsman and asking their advice/alerting my MP. I was advised by the Parliamentary Ombudsman to send SLAM a request for a final response letter. Not long after addressing this request to the Chief Executive, making it clear that I wished him to respond to me, I was later told by letter that the matter was being dealt with/reviewed by other staff members (although the situation did not call for it) and then told in the final letter response I received (which was from a different person) that one of the other senior staff members involved was saying that it was their view, after looking through my earlier letters to the Trust, that there were no outstanding things that needed to be answered/explained by the Trust - although it should have been obvious to anybody that this was not the case.\n\nAs a result of all this, I am now having to ask the Parliamentary Ombudsman Service to get involved. Had this Trust dealt with my complaint in a fair and reasonable way, by accepting full responsibility for the things they did which were wrong, there would be no need for me to do this - but as they have chosen not to do so, they have put me in this position. I think that the way that I have been treated by them is appalling.", "I have a back condition and my spine is very stiff, so when I slipped and fell flat on my back, I was very concerned that I may have seriously damaged it. \nAn ambulance took me to A&E at East Surrey Hospital. There I explained to everyone about my concern about my spine, and I explained at length about why I believed my spine was vulnerable to damage. The Doctors kept me in for 30 hours, and gave me xrays and a CT scan, and I was eventually assured that there was no damage to my spine and I was sent home.\nThankfully I asked my Rheumatology Consultant at the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases in Bath to have a look at my xrays and scan. He did this and immediately he spotted I had fractured a vertebra. So I went to see the Orthopaedic Consultant at East Surrey Hospital, he had another xray taken, and immediately spotted that the fracture in my neck was so unstable that it was unsafe for me to even go home. I was admitted immediately and four days later he operated to put a plate in my neck.\nHad I not gone for the second opinion, and just taken what the A&E told me, then I could either be a quadriplegic or even dead.", "Dead Redhillchilipepper\r\nI am sorry to read of your experience and understand your concerns.

The request was blatantly ignored. One doctor argued with me in front of my my relative and said family can only stay with relatives if they are dying. I later met with this doctor who informed me our relative was not dying.\nOur relative lost use of one arm many years ago and their right shoulder had been broken some years ago, because of this our relative struggled to cut up food open containers etc. My sister and I made this known to staff and requested that we stay to help our relative eat and because of their lack of mobility and poor eyesight we asked that they help with medication. This request was refused and we were told that we would have to leave during medication and meal times and that Nurses would assist. At this stage I was already concerned about the care and conflicting information on the MAU. On more than 1 occasion I found our relative sitting in front of a cold tray of food with the food uncut, and tops left on desserts and drinks. When I challenged this Nurses replied that they were busy and they would get round to it. This seemed quite typical in terms of what we saw.\nOur relative was then sent to Ward 22 where they stayed for approximately 2 weeks. Our relative was discharged without an aftercare plan despite them living alone.\nOur relative had also developed a pressure sore on one heal on ward 22. (we think this is more evidence of poor care). The night they got home, our relative fell on the stairs on the way to bed and she was readmitted to ward 32, we were informed that the pneumonia had not cleared. Our relative was eventually discharged with a full aftercare package and still requiring a nurse to dress her pressure sore. They were readmitted again to Ward 15. The pneumomia had not cleared.\nIt was at this point my sister and I decided we should note some of the incidents we observed.\nOn numerous occasions Tablets were left on the table in a dispensing cup Having restricted use of their arm and had poor eyesight our relative could not take their medication unassisted. Despite telling staff about this, it happened time and time again.\nWe requested a meeting with the doctor and the Consultant. Again we raised our concerns about poor treatment and our relatives fear of hospitals and doctors and it was agreed there should be 3 way communication.\nWhen our relative had water retention and her ankles were swollen. The footstool provided was far too high and it was causing pain. The physiotherapist said they would provide a lower footstool.\nWe noticed that Mum was not eating but the food chart stated that our relative was eating almost everything. We informed the nurse. We were told they would monitor her food intake.\nI informed the nurse our relative was in severe pain and was tired, was visibly weaker and appeared to be deteriorating. I asked if the oxygen levels had been tested and I was informed they were OK.\nI spoke to the deputy ward manager and told our relative was still not eating, they were tired and weak and breathing seemed laboured The Deputy Ward Manager told me they were not too weak and that had walked to the toilet alone using her delta frame.\nWe observed that all of our relatives tablets had again been left on the table in the dispensing cup. Mum had been put on oxygen and had deteriorated further. A Nurse brought a drip and hung it over the bed lamp She informed us that our relative had a chest X-Ray and had pneumonia on her lower left lung. Although a cannular was due to be fitted for IV antibiotics early afternoon, it was not fitted until late evening.\nWhen we met with the consultant we asked the prognosis - given the fact that we were told on the MAU that our relative was dying. We were informed that they were poorly and may require an operation on her kidney.\nWe informed him about tablets constantly being left on the table, he said he would speak to the ward manager\nI asked why I was ignored when I had told the nurse I suspected or relatives oxygen levels had dropped and was subsequently proven right there was no reply\nWe informed him that our relative had deteriorated and their speech was not right and the fact they struggled to get to the toilet with a frame and assistance was a long long way from how they were before admission. He did not comment\nWe also informed him that our relative's legs were swollen but despite this no footstool had been provided\nOur relative had not eaten all of her food but the food chart said that it had been eaten. Tea was being counted as fluid (despite the dehydrating effect of caffeine) and our relative was only having small sips of tea. The chart incorrectly recorded the time the cannula was fitted.\nWhile we were there a nurse had asked our relative what they had eaten - They could not remember, it was at this point we realised our relativess food intake was not being monitored.\nIt was noticed that the antibiotic drip had finished and was uncomfortable. We asked for it to be removed in the afternoon. At 7. 15pm I had to ask staff again to remove the same drip. The footstool provided with was on the opposite side of the bed.\nNurse said our relative was lively - this was a lie, their speech was slurred and they were very grey in colour and was lethargic.\nWe met with the consultant and informed him of our grave concerns\nDoctors kept referring to Mums TB - Our mum had NEVER had TB\nWe highlighted that up until admission our relative was able to walk, they were independent despite their impairments. We highlighted that their speech was slurred and they were unable to stand unaided the movement in the left arm had deteriorated and they were drooling from one side of her mouth.\nMy sister asked for our relatives oxygen to be put back on and a Nurse did this. Later the doctor pulled me to one side and told me that ONLY nurses should put the oxygen back on. He was implying that my sister had done this and it was against the agreed plan of care. I informed him that a Nurse had put the oxygen back on. He said nothing in reply.\nTablets left in the dispensing cup on the table but the Nurse informed us they had observed medication being taken. This was untrue.\nOur relative had not had any of her ensure drink. they were clearly upset and had been crying. Our relative informed me that the urologist had told them he was going to put a drain in their kidney \"early next week\". I spoke to nursing staff about this - they were gathered around the table having a chat. They informed me the Urologist had not seen our relative and they were confused. I spoke to the doctor who informed me nothing would happen until the pneumonia had cleared. Once the pneumonia had cleared, they would move our relative to the rehab unit and they would be treated as an outpatient for her kidneys. I went to explain this to our distressed relative, but the patient in the next bed said that she had heard the doctor and our relative was was right. I went back to tell the Nursing staff and they laughed and said \"we have more than one confused patient on the ward' I found this comment particularly offensive and left the ward sobbing as the pressure and stress was becoming too much to bare.\nOur relative had a very sore mouth, it was dry and cut and it was too painful to eat. I asked the Nurse if our relative could have porridge I was told porridge was not on the menu but used a low salt menu to get Mum her porridge.\nOur relative still had difficulty eating their mouth was still very sore I asked another nurse about porridge, she brought a soft food Menu - this had never been offered before.\nI arrived on the ward our relative was sobbing. They had been told they were having a nephostromy tomorrow. A Nurse confirmed this. Again despite numerous requests to be present whenever our relative was seeing a consultant our requests were ignored. We had even put the request in writing.\nOur relative had been put back on oxygen The doctor informed us that they had pus in her kidney and the kidney wont clear while the pus is there so a nephrostomy was essential.\nOur relative was taken down for her Nephrostomy. The surgeon informed me that they had TWO pressure sores, one on each heel and told me that she was completing an incident form as one wound had gone close to the bone. She asked me to ensure that the staff on the ward dressed the wounds.\nI had to remind The nurse to dress the pressure sores\nOn ward 15 on 2 occasions our relative contracted the Norovirus, yet doctors and ward staff were frequently observed not following the correct hand hygiene procedures when they were walking on and off the ward and between rooms.\nMy sister and I complained about the standard of care in writing to the Matron and even though she met with us they later said there was no record of the complaint.\nOur relative was moved to Ward 2 Much better standard of care! They were given a chair with a leg rest and was offered a soft food menu, without us having to ask. A red tray so given for for assisted feeding.\nOn ward 2 we didn't keep detailed notes as the standard of care was good.\nWe were informed our relative would be home in a few days.\nOur relative got another infection. Doctors tried to insert a drip into but couldn't find a vein. A senior doctor told us our relative was close to death and they thought it best not to take them to intensive care and scare them by putting \"lines in the neck\" He said all of this in front of our relative who was terrified so said they didn't want to go to intensive care.\nOur relative was moved into a side room. The doctor told us they would die in a day or 2. On the first day we tried to give sips of water but the nurse said we were best not giving anything to drink and just to use swabs in the mouth. After 5 days of no food and drink, Our relative was still alive but was in a great deal of pain. My sister and I queried the withdrawal of treatment and we were asked to speak to a palliative nurse. The palliative nurse informed us that our relative was on a care pathway and this slow death was normal and could take up to 2 weeks.\nOur relative was in agonising pain for 10 days and this to our mind was caused by the Liverpool Care pathway. It got to the stage when we were unable to hug them, or comb their hair or hold their had. Our relatives body began swelling - we were not warned of this and we had to remove a ring from their finger as they were turning blue. Fluids were leaking through their hands (we were not told about this either) after 10 grueling days our relative died. This was not a painless and peaceful and kind death this was torture.\nWe sent a letter of complaint to the hospital and received an 8 page replay apologising for their shortcomings and telling us things had been put in place to prevent it happening again.\n\nHistory repeats itself:\n\nYesterday we visited a very ill friend in hospital on ward 15 and this is what we found/were told about:\nShe was left unwashed as nobody even bothered to check if she needed assistance\nHer tablets were left in a cup on the bedside table despite the fact her memory is poor and her eyesight and mobility are bad she could not reach them and did not know they were there.\nDespite lack of balance and poor mobility our friend was lying on the edge of the bed without the cot sides up\nShe was unable to use the control on the bed and the emergency call button was out of reach.\nShe was left undressed as she was unable to put her pyjama bottoms on and a member of staff had told her she could not assist but failed to get her any help.\nHer wash things and toothbrush had been left on the bed because she was unable to reach her own locker\nHer hands and fingers were swollen and her fingers were blue but no one has bothered to take off her wedding ring\nHer feet were swollen yet her legs were not raised.\nShe struggled to drink out of a glass without assistance yet no beaker has been offered.\nNurses sat at their station chatting and ignored people waiting to see them.\nMy sister and I were distraught this brought back horrific memories about the poor treatment of our relative and we have major concerns about the treatment of our friend.\nIt is obvious that the 8 page apology was merely lip service to appease us.\nNot only has this hospital failed but I feel it's complaints procedure has failed.  I now feel it has proven to be a complete waste of time.", "These are serious complaints which will be investigated by our team.\r\nPlease call us at 0151 529 3287 or email us at customerservice@aintree.nhs.uk or visit https://www.aintreehospitals.nhs.uk/PatientInformation/Patient-Advice-and-Complaints-Team/Pages/default.aspx so that we can discuss this further with you.", "Thank you once again for your comments - it is really important that we hear about the experiences of the people that use our services both good and bad and make improvements where we need to.

My complaint email has been returned undelivered by Thornbury. However, here is a copy of my complaint.\nI was referred to Thornbury hospital by my gp for a gynaecological operation. With Thornbury hospital being a private hospital, I was expecting the care to be outstanding. However, I was sorely disappointed from and I feel there were so many minor and major issues I picked up on during my experience that I doubt Thornbury wouldn't pass the friends and family test.\nI have bullet pointed some of the issues I came across:\n- at pre-op assessment, I informed the nurse that I believed my large ovarian cyst ruptured recently as I had suffered severe pain. I asked her if she could speak with the consultant regarding this, as I had had a CT scan the morning after suspected rupture. The nurse told me that there was no need, as if the cyst had ruptured, I'd be dead by now! However it was found that my cyst had indeed ruptured. My abdomen was full of blood according to my operating consultant, which has caused internal damage, which may have been minimised had the nurse not dismissed my concerns.\n-upon admission to the ward, I was informed that I would be going to theatre at midday, and I would be informed of any delays or changes. I was not collected for theatre until nearly 4pm. I was not informed of any delay or changes!\nThe practitioner who collected me for my surgery, checked my consent form with me, which is correct procedure. However at the end they asked me, do you understand any of that, because I don't!  I don't believe this sort of statement would put any patient at ease immediately prior to going to surgery.\nMy 1st night at Thornbury, I was in a lot of pain following my surgery. I asked my nurse for some analgesia. She agreed to get some strong analgesia for me. 15 minutes later a different nurse who I had not met before entered my room and gave me an injection in my leg! I can only assume this injection was an opiate, however I was not informed about what it was. However, it seemed this new nurse I had not met previously did not check my patient details, allergies, or my vital observations prior to administering the opiate drug.\nA couple of times during my stay, I accidentally set of the nurse call system, due to the placement of the button. Both times a member of staff entered my room with the statement, what do you want?  When I explained that I had not meant to call them to my room, their attitude was incredibly rude!\nUpon seeing my fluid intake and output chart the following morning, I noted the night nurse had just made up how much I drank and went to the toilet! As it was completely inaccurate, and the nurse hadn't asked me once how much I'd drank or gone to the toilet. I informed the day nurse of the inaccurate documentation that morning.\nI had an incredibly sore throat following surgery, which can be expected, however on examination of my throat, I going quite a nasty injury to the back of my throat. (For which I have pictures of. ) I informed 3 nurses about this issue, and not one of them would check the injury as requested or inform the anaesthetist of an intubation injury.\nI am prescribed medication, which I take daily. I brought this medication in with me, and informed the staff. The prescription was written up on my drug kardex. I was not once given my routine medication during my 2 night stay at Thornbury.\nThe first day following my surgery, I was given a meal. Whilst eating this meal, I realised I could taste Bell Peppers (which I am allergic to) despite having an allergy band stating this and the kitchen staff being informed of my allergy! My meal was taken away from me when I informed the staff of their error and I was given an antihistamine thankfully. However I was not offered any meal replacement!\nI found nearly all the nurse staff to be very rude when speaking to me! I was made to feel an inconvenience to them. Even my relatives commented on the rudeness of the staff!\nI could not wait to get out of Thornbury hospital! I did not feel safe or well looked after. I must say, it was an absolute stark contrast to the care I was expecting. It has taken me a month and a half to even come to terms with writing up my letter of complaint. However I feel it necessary to do so.", "Dear Tori8980,\r\nThank you for taking the time to post your feedback, which obviously makes for an upsetting read. I am sorry that your experience with us was not a positive one. It is interesting that you refer to the Friends and Family test. I am surprised at your points as our patient feedback, and indeed Friends and Family ratings are very high.\r\nHowever, it is very important that we investigate your complaint. We have searched our robust complaints records and can not find anything that resembles what you have written, so we are presuming that you have not made a formal complaint.\r\nAs much of your complaint is of a serious clinical nature, it is important that we investigate your points fully and thoroughly with you so we can follow the correct complaints process, investigate in detail and make our on-going reports and plans for change. We can not do this anonymously.\r\nIt is not appropriate for us to continue the investigation of such a serious nature online so I would like you to contact me directly at the hospital on 0114 266 1133 or email me at david.mills@bmihealthcare.co.uk or alternatively complete the contact form on our website, so we can follow the correct complaints procedure and ensure that everything is logged.\r\nOnce we have spoken at length, we will issue a response on this site also to inform other readers of the plans and steps that we will set in place.\r\nKind regards\r\nDavid R Mills\r\nExecutive Director\r\nBMI Thornbury Hospital\r\n312 Fulwood Road, Sheffield, S10 3BR", "The complaint is ongoing, and I would not wish to disclose personal details on a public forum so I'll stick purely to facts and circumstances. Suffice to say that a few years ago, I was treated in such a way by my physio that I was humiliated and degraded in the corridors of RD&E hospital.\nAt the end of that appointment, the physio said that there was no point in seeing me until I could carry out specific walking based tasks. I was actually seeing this physio for treatment of a condition, which had taken most of my leg functionality (both legs) and rendered me unable to walk without at least one crutch. \nThe physio made it perfectly clear that I should not go back until I could complete these tasks, by saying that seeing me was a waste of clinic hours that could be better used by others. This physio told me that I should just walk normally. The pain from the effort of it all reduced me to tears in that corridor. I asked for a second \"stick\" in order that I might achieve the impossible task I was being set. I suffer from somatoform pain disorder, among other things, so this was no easy feat. It was after failing at this task that the physio made it clear I should not return until I could do things their way. Wasn't that what I was there for? To get help with all that? I feel that I was effectively discharged by the physio at that appointment.\nSeveral years on, the continued unsupervised use of a crutch in my right arm has led my shoulder to serious harm; I use a wheelchair now when things are too difficult and am currently receiving treatment elsewhere for rotator cuff injury and other damage which prevents me from using my right arm much at all. I believe that I am now more disabled than I was before as a result of the failure of treatment by that physio.\nI wrote to the Chief Exec of Wonford hospital about all this, and the response is almost laughably inadequate. I have yet to see any solid proof that my complaint is being taken seriously or that any kind of investigation has taken place at all. I requested a copy of my complaint record and received copies of the letters exchanged between us and a couple of insignificant emails between staff. Not a shred of any investigation records, which indicates that the Trust's own complaints policy is not being followed and my complaint not being taken seriously. What's more, the administration/management of the hospital have taken the view that since nobody else has made a similar complaint, my experience can't have happened. The latest response suggests that trampling on someone's rights is ok if the person concerned didn't mean to. Considering the Chief Exec et al are ultimately accountable, if I prove the hospital to be in breach of my rights, I would have expected a deeper level of concern.\nI am at the stage now of deciding on the legal route or the ombudsman. I think I'll go Ombudsman first, otherwise the legal route will close off that option. I think also the CQC should be made aware of all this.\nAnyway, I just wanted to get my 'story' out there, because the hospital don't seem to be taking it seriously. Thanks for reading.", "Thank you for sharing your story and I am very sorry to hear of your concerns.

On admission found to have lost 2 units of blood and dehydrated. He was already suffering from a serious heart condition and type 2 diabetes.\nFollowing a transfusion, he was placed on a general ward, taken off a heart monitor and placed in a side room. After 2 days his blood pressure was partially restored, but continued to decline gently, despite anti-hypertensive medication being withdrawn. No record was kept of fluids in or out and, despite being diabetic, he was allowed large bars of chocolate and a mars bar. The food served was not checked against food ordered \u2013 vital in diabetes.\nThe ward seemed adequately staffed, but those on duty were in my view too busy chatting to each other, or having meetings, to efficiently monitoring patients. The hospital was using an out of date record chart (filled in sloppily) and the nursing notes were poor. He was left alone, unmonitored, in his side room for long periods, despite having attacks of breathlessness at night. After a week he was moved from to a general bay. Despite his heart condition, no room was ever found for him on the heart ward and no cause or explanation was given as to the original significant loss of blood. The ward, although clean, was littered with tatty notices and felt more like a nursery than professional hospital. The only professional looking notices were from the physiotherapy department. Doctor and nurse communication was awful.\n\nEventually the cardiology team, having fiddled with his medication, declared him fit to go home, despite the reservations of his relatives. (They had declared him fit with his first heart attack six months earlier, only for him to be re-admitted by ambulance a few days later). No proper assessment of his home circumstances was undertaken.\n\n36 hours after discharge, whilst in the care of his relatives, he suffered a further severe attack of breathlessness and his heart stopped in the ambulance. The crew were marvellous and, on admission to another hospital, he was placed in intensive care and given a blood transfusion to replace further loss of blood. At the time of writing, the other hospital has him being properly monitored and is arranging a transfer to Swansea for decent investigation as to the loss of blood.\n\nTwice in the past six months Neville Hall have discharged the same patient who nearly died days later. I am concerned about what seems from my experience to be a dilapidated and disgracefully run hospital. ", "Dear Aberllynfi,\r\nThank you for your feedback.

She never seemed to receive the treatment she went in for and died within 4 days.\nI have started a complaint and was promised feedback etc within 2-3 weeks and it is now 4 weeks. My emails are apparently being ignored by senior staff. All emails are being forwarded to my Solicitors.", "I have a history of self-harm and suicide attempts over the past few years. It wasn't until 2014 when I took an almost fatal overdose that I was placed in the Becklin Centre as an inpatient. \nI can't remember the first 2 days because I was too 'out of it' and (as told by other service users) I kept falling over and that certain staff members were dragging me around the ward. The first day I can remember (2 days after admission), I self-harmed and the nurse who was working with me on that shift bandaged me up and talked to me until I felt stable and the urges had gone. However, she is one of very few that treated me that way. On other occasions when I self harmed, I was told that, and I quote \"you're silly and you will regret those when you're older and have to explain them to people\".\nI am very quiet and smile a lot (coping mechanism I developed during my childhood) and I felt that I wasn't listened to or taken seriously at all, even though I told them this. I felt other service users who were less patient and more loud/aggressive got what they wanted (e.g. cigarette breaks, a chat, etc) rather than those who asked politely and were told to wait several hours. For me it was usually a chat because I was distressed. Sometimes the help never came.\nOn a different, but similar note, I have noticed that several members of the Crisis Team are very rude. Recently I told them I wanted to kill myself and felt like I would do so had I left the hospital at that point. They said \"Okay\", and then discharged me. \nI then left the hospital and jumped in front of a car on a busy road. The car did a sudden stop and asked if I was okay. I said I'm fine but was crying and then he drove off. I then lay on the floor hoping a car would hit and kill me, but then a man got out of his car and picked me up, just as the police and then ambulance arrived. \nI was taken back to see the Crisis team who took 5 hours to arrive, so I was told that if I tried to leave the hospital I would be put under a Section and police were all outside the room. So I waited 5 hours, just for the crisis team nurse to say \"Hi, you're discharged. You can go now\". I felt this was very inappropriate given the state I was in. She didn't offer a chat or any other service.", "My experience of ward D1 at Royal Blackburn hospital was like a waking nightmare. My mother was treated as if she had dementia, when there was no previous diagnosis or clinical evidence. I felt that they used dementia as an excuse for the symptoms of their own failings, like her dehydration, an untreated infection, and poor nursing. \nShe was not given life-saving treatment, when there was overwhelming evidence, (subsequently revealed in her medical notes) that she had sepsis. Ward D1 is an MRSA isolation ward and early treatment of sepsis is essential. At that time, she was denied food and fluids on a bogus claim of dementia, when it is known sepsis changes cognitive function in not only elderly patients but patients of any age. \nWhen it became septic shock, the facts were covered up and in our view she was denied the care she needed, based on their supposed interest in her quality of life.\nI feel this ward really needs serious investigation as I believe that patient safety has been compromised and in my case my mother died as a result of what happened there.\nA formal investigation recently acknowledged that my mother had died of sepsis, almost three years after her death. Why did the form after her death say that the family were happy with her care, when it was known I had called in safeguarding? And why is septic shock or sepsis not mentioned on her death certificate, but instead an infection without clinical evidence? Why was sepsis never at any point mentioned to the family?\nWe are in the process of establishing a patients' forum to call for a full investigation as soon as possible into standards of care at the Royal Blackburn Hospital that have been hidden and overlooked.", "The Coventry & Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust have provided me with psychiatric care services for several years. I am informed by my treating consultant psychiatrist my mental health diagnoses include bipolar affective disorder & PTSD. I attend regular outpatient clinic appointments with consultant psychiatrist approximately once each 3 months. The community mental health team visit me at home once each fortnight however visits maybe less frequent. I am visited by named community psychiatric nurse & social worker.\nFrom late October 2013 to March 2014 I experienced mental & physical ill health \u2013 elevated mood, sleep disturbance insomnia, respiratory problems. Local community mental health team CMHT know I have experienced recurrent chronic mental ill health for several years. They visit me to monitor my mental health status to ensure I remain in satisfactory mental health living in community. My community psychiatric nurse CPN wrote to my general practitioner in January 2014. CPN recognised I had respiratory problems & compromised physical health which she attributed to my keeping pets. Community psychiatric nurse did not comment on my mental health in this letter.\nIn late March 2014 I attended appointment with independent consultant psychiatrist employed by Nottinghamshire mental health NHS Trust. A close friend accompanied me to appointment who contributed information about my past behaviour during psychiatric consultation. I have known this consultant psychiatrist several years. Independent consultant psychiatrist's report detailed that over previous 3 or 4 months I had experienced hypomanic illness. Supporting evidence: insomnia; over talkative; irritability; overspending. I purchased children's toys for my pet parrots & relatively cheap jewellery from eBay. This was first time I had purchased any items from eBay. \nIn January 2014 I took out 4 bank loans to continue to finance my spending as I had used up my savings. At the time, I did not consider how I would repay loans, I was just happy banks had allowed me to borrow money even though I was not employed. I struggle to make loan monthly repayments as I am not in paid employment. Independent consultant psychiatrist at appointment gave me advice regards management of my debt recommending I contact a debt management charity \u2013 Step change \u2013 for free advice. Independent consultant psychiatrist gave me other useful information regards management of my mental health & financial circumstances. Independent consultant psychiatrist suggested he write me a letter to give to banks detailing loans were taken out at times of mental ill health.\nI have experienced mental health difficulties which were immediately recognised & addressed by independent consultant psychiatrist. In contrast my treating psychiatric team Coventry & Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust provide me with no support regards management of my financial debt.\nAfter independent consultant psychiatrist recognised my financial difficulties were attributable to mental ill health I tried repeatedly unsuccessfully to gain support from Coventry & Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust staff. Coventry & Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust staff instructs me financial debt is (a) my responsibility, (b) loans were taken out with my consent knowledge whilst I had mental health capacity, (c) staff do not live with me so cannot control my finances (d) my situation is better than living in Syria (it is not clear how this analogy equates to my circumstances) (e) staff knew I was ordering parcels on line & considered this my normal behaviour \u2013 staff continued to state this knowing my car was full of parcels as house had become full parcels. In my view Coventry & Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust staff did not address other changes in my behaviour that they commented on such as \u2013 (a) I started smoking I do not usually smoke (b) I spent more time on line on social forums & a few gambling websites. I do not usually use gambling websites.\nI tried to gain support from Coventry & Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust staff via\n- Contact CMHT staff\n- Contact crisis team staff\n- Email consultant psychiatrist\n- Contact complaints department via phone & email\nI have received some supportive advice regards management of my situation from local Coventry police, rethink charity, step change charity, general practitioner & my Councillor which I appreciate. Otherwise my attempts to gain support are futile.\nI have requested Coventry & Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust discharge me from further follow up with psychiatric services. It is unhelpful for staff to instruct me I chose to take out significant debt which I cannot repay. I have never been in debt in my life & find my situation overwhelming, degrading. I do not want to receive any further psychiatric care from Coventry & Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust staff who I find judgmental, critical, and non-empathetic. Coventry & Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust provide a service that is unfit for purpose\nConclusion-In my view:\n\n(1) Coventry & Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust have redefined definition of hypomanic illness. Overspending is no longer a symptom of bipolar affective disorder.\n(2) Coventry & Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust practice & deliver mental health services to patients \"out on a limb\". The services delivered by Coventry & Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust vary considerably from those provided by other NHS trusts\n(3) Provision of support for mental health service users is becoming increasingly difficult to access perhaps in part due to financial cuts by coalition government", "Dear George53\r\nThank you for posting your concerns.

My story begins with me trying to access the care I needed for my medical conditions which require careful management from different clinical teams. \n\nBecause of all the difficulties I made a lot of attempts to contact the hospital to resolve crucial questions about my treatment. The hospital reacted by labelling me with \"unacceptable behaviour\" and putting in place a management plan to manage my attendance at the hospital. This letter made reference to violent and aggressive behaviour, which was completely untrue. It would be hard for me to sum up all the impact this has had on me both in terms of sorting out my treatment but also the psychological impact of it all, which is still going on for me. As a result of this management plan information was shared with other agencies including the police and I suffered from very negative attitudes and verbal intimidation from staff and others in my local area.\n\nI followed through a formal complaint and also took my case to the Ombudsman who upheld my complaint. It has been a really hard road to get there, and my story has been featured in the HSJ and also in the local press because I have been determined to make sure the issues here were addressed.\nIt transpired in all this that I was sent a letter which was not accurate by the trusts own admission. This letter was sent to other agencies and I still am feeling the impact of these actions. Also the trust restricted unfairly my access to the hospital.\n\nSo I would urge trusts to ensure that where issues arise about accessing treatment, they do not as in this case default to a process which did not address the individual circumstances and resulted in significant damage psychologically as well as great cost to the trust and time taken up with other agencies. I lost all services at Milton Keynes Hospital, all referrals made by my GP were declined, it was extremely dangerous when urgent treatment was required. I travelled miles to another hospital for emergency treatment, anyway from friends and family. My parents always supported me during these difficult times. It seemed that a standard type letter was sent out without checking it was fit for purpose.\n\nThe trust insisted there was an ongoing police investigation, after discussing my concerns I have been told by local police force this was not sure. The trust lied and caused distress. I never thought a hospital that cares for patients, could ban a patient for making complaints.

They falsified records (which they have admitted to). I received 2 statements from 2 doctors which I think are false and I think can be proven they are false.\nWe were told they would do a external independent investigation but this ended up only a review by a nurse who actually works at the hospital. In this review she finds many wrong doings but amazingly concludes she can find no negligence even though she states that the records have been falsified.\nMany more things I could go on with but will it do any good as it appears that they will tell falsehoods to back themselves up.

Also it seems that you have concerns about the care at the hospital and would want to raise these concerns on behalf of patients.

We accept that communication with you could have been better, and we could have been more aware of your needs in understanding the severity of the patient's condition, and we are very sorry for this.\r\nWe can state that no records or statements were falsified, and its our view that we did not refuse treatment, or care. Often the management of end of life care for patients and relatives is a careful balance.\r\nWe are really sorry that you feel so let down and are still not satisfied. Please contact me if you wish to on 01254 733698, as I am happy to talk this through with you.

Then they were seemingly covering it up until it all came to light when medical records were accessed. The staff on the ward at the time showed no compassion, and have to be the worst people my family has had to deal with.\nThe hospital trust has definitely not showed any duty of candour to my family. They also seem to find it acceptable to have nurses shrugging shoulders when asked questions on my mam's care because they can't recall as they didn't even have time to fill in her general medical notes. \nThe trust has acknowledged approx 25 failings in my mam's care in the one week she was in hospital, for the treatable reason she was in for. Knowing a loved one's death was potentially avoidable is the hardest thing anyone has to cope with. In my opinion these people should not be allowed to be still working. Wonder how many more take the fact that someone dies naturally on face value when actually they possibly didn't.

I should be banging a drum for the excellent work done there & my dad should be a poster boy for all that is good within the NHS, instead he will be remembered by us for the mistakes and lack of care & treatment he received before he died.\n30 years ago he was given about 2 weeks to live, after a major operation & to the surprise of his surgeon (Mr Sugden, a man that our family will forever be indebted to, a man that was a God in the eyes of my father) he fully recovered. After this my dad wouldn't let a bad word be said about the NHS.\nA few years ago my father had a routine procedure, when he contracted something we were described as \"a bug in his bloodstream\". They couldn't get the infection under control & after almost 8 weeks they had to transfer him to The Southern General for 3 & 1/2 weeks then almost 3 weeks at Kirklandside Hospital. When he was discharged he needed 24 hour care & we were told he would never walk again. With the excellent care from the ISIS Team, his GP & physio we managed to get him walking about 30 steps unaided.\nFollowing another minor procedure he was sent home from Crosshouse with Campylobacter.\nHe recovered from this only to be admitted to Crosshouse with a minor turn. For some reason his medication was withheld, his heart rate spiked at 228, they gave him his meds & his heart rate normalised.\nHe was due to be discharged when he had a fall, they said he could have a brain bleed but they didn't scan or X-ray him, his was in a virtual vegetative state for 9 days, he picked up again, they said \"he might have an infection coming on\". They sent him home with E-Coli & to make things worse they sent him home with E-Coli resistant antibiotics!\nHe was readmitted & I wouldn't know where to start documenting the care & treatment (or lack of it) They failed to get the infection under control and he died. The nightmare continues, they wanted to issue a death certificate from a doctor that knew nothing about my dad & had only started that morning.

She's very unsteady on her feet and is very likely to fall over if she isn't supported. For some strange reason the ambulance man didn't accompany her to the door and let her walk on her own. While she was walking to the door, she fell over and banged her head. I was up in her flat and saw her down on the ground after she had fallen. The paramedic who came afterwards agreed this shouldn't have happened and was intending to report this. My friend is now back in Dorchester Hospital. If she had not fallen, she would not be there.\r\nI don't want anyone to get into trouble here but I think it's important to make sure this doesn't happen again. There must have been a breakdown in communication here as it's clear that ambulance driver was unaware of how unsteady my friend is on her feet.", "Dear Legg007\r\nThank you for taking the time to share your experience.

I have a long letter of his stay times and dates of many errors and incorrect information on notes. \nI took photo evidence as we put in a complaint but not got anywhere up to now. The photo I have of my dad a week before he went on Brearley Ward and a few days before he died are so heartbreaking. He looks like he's been mistreated and locked away somewhere with no food. \nTo make matters worse when I went to collect his death certificate and was talking to a coroner who assisted with his post mortem we told them how my dad was 3 weeks previous. The coroner told us to go ahead with a complaint or we would live with regret. Did they see how malnourished my beautiful dad looked I wonder?", "I feel that Tameside hospital caused my pensioner mother to become so ill and immobile she has never recovered enough to return home.\nMy mother was not physically ill or injured when she went to Tameside hospital, she was suffering from a form of psychosis. Earlier in the year she had spent two months on the mental health unit with the same problem. However, she made a full recovery without additional medication and continued to attend the unit as an outpatient.\nFive months later the symptoms returned and she was badly in need of psychiatric care. In late August 2013 she rang the police who arranged for an ambulance to take her to the hospital.\nFrom the moment she entered Tameside hospital she became a victim of what I feel were serious mistakes, followed by covering up and lies. My mother became so physically ill (while I feel they were ignoring her psychosis) that she was on a medical ward for a month. Then, still unwell she was moved to Grange view which is owned and run by Tameside hospital for a further two months. \nEven then my mother was not well enough to go home. Following three months of hospitalisation, lack of exercise and an ignored fall she never regained her mobility. She lost her voice when she had an allergic reaction and that too has not returned. She became deconditioned, depressed, withdrawn and unable to communicate. She was sent to a care home, where she remains in this state of deterioration. Sadly my mother will remain there for the rest of her days.\nTameside hospital had her medical notes for reference. In addition, I gave the doctor from a&e her mother's medical history. I explained that my mother was a psychiatric patient and not physically ill. I gave details of her mother's medication including a penicillin allergy.\nHere are some examples of the unacceptable way my mother was treated by Tameside hospital:\n( a ) refused to acknowledge she was a psychiatric patient, and have the psychosis she was presenting treated.\n( b ) refused to contact her psychiatrist despite assuring me they would. (The only reason her psychiatrist became remotely involved is because I made direct contact with his office. This was when I discovered my mother was being discharged after 72 hours. I told the hospital that my mother was not leaving until she had been treated her psychosis. It was unsafe for her to leave. That was the reason she was brought to the hospital)\n( c ) informed by staff the mental health unit was full, with a waiting list of three weeks\n( d ) put her on a general medical ward, where she did not belong. Not only was she treated medically badly, she was humiliated by the situation, as some of the other patients considered her odd behaviour to be a source of amusement.\n( e ) given four consecutive doses of an antibiotic to which they knew she had an allergy.\n( f ) antibiotics were unnecessary anyway as all her tests results were clear\n( g ) collaboration by the staff who did everything possible to cover their mistakes\n( h ) failed to inform us about the mistakes, and that she had been given penicillin.\n( I ) prevented her from attending a much needed appointment with her psychiatrist.\n( j ) prevented her from seeing a social worker.\n( k ) she had a fall which left her badly bruised\nMy mother became very ill. She was immobile incontinent had breathing difficulties and lost her voice. For four days, I was frantic with worry as I watched my mother's health deteriorate and had no idea why. Yet the staff knew why, but did not say.\nI read her medical notes, and discovered my mother had been given penicillin. I confronted the nurse in charge, who refused to accept my mother was allergic to penicillin. This nurse became angry when I was said my mother was most definitely allergic to the drug, but still refused to add it to her notes. Days later when she developed a rash was this nurse was forced to admit it. However, the nurse still would not include it in her notes\nWhen I questioned the staff they denied all knowledge of her mother falling. However when she was admitted to Grange view three weeks later, the bruising was still bad enough to warrant photographs being taken by the person in charge.\nI made a formal complaint to the hospital, which was made up of twelve complaints. I also asked them to fund my mother's care costs, which is the least they could do. I was disgusted by their response and their refusal to fund my mother's care.\nThe hospital exaggerated their apologies for the minor complaints, in an attempt to overshadow the more serious matters which have been denied.\nTameside Hospital have played a huge part in my mother's quality of life being reduced to zero. She has given up, and although she is not dead, she may as well be according to her. She repeatedly tells me that she wishes she were dead.\nI do not give up easily, and will continue my plight to seek justice.", "I can't seem to get any care now from the Lister either X-ray pathology or accident and emergency.

I recieved\nVery poor care and understanding yesterday in a +e after a? TIA on Friday evening and after attending a+e yesterday (Saturday) I received such horrid care and had some comments said to me out loud by a nurse I did not know - said in front of a packed waiting room filled with patients and their supporters all receiving a very very different level of care to me. I was alone as always when I come to the Lister and A+E - always alone - whether it's with an overdose or feeling suicidal or having cut through tendons or deep cutting my arms, I was left on a trolley last year in the corridor and was found having fallen off the high trolley onto the tiled floor fitting from a overdose by a dr who heard happened to see. I never complained, was covered in bruises in the next few days from the fall, I could have - there were enough witnesses to it and I was in Rescus for the next several hrs.

It was last November 2013 I finally was taken seriously enough for the trust to run an MRI Proctogram.\nThey diagnosed Mucosal Prolapse. Told me to live with it as operation would be very painful. Took second opinion at UCLH Colorectal surgeon who also seemingly misdiagnosed.\nGP referred me urgently to see the lead surgeon at St Marks Bowel hospital. Was diagnosed with full thickness rectal prolapse requiring Laparascopic ventral rectopexy. This centre of excellence coordinated several other tests which resulted in confirmation of slow transit study confirming I had an extremely slow transit of my sigmoid colon and entire colon. In order for a laparoscopic ventral rectopexy to be done they have advised not to resect my sigmoid colon as it could leak. They have also have advised to think carefully re operating with slow transit problem as operation could result in my colon becoming worse re evacuating although prolapse repaired. In addition there are other factors to beware of re bladder problems post op.\nWhy I ask myself did St Mary's Hospital fail to run extra diagnostics? Why did they fail to correctly take the initiative time to look into matters more thoroughly?\nI can honestly say that the lead surgeon St Marks knew her stuff.\nShe also commented that St Mary's may not have the necessary expertise when it comes to dealing with complex bowel problems.\nWhy is it that two NHS Colorectal surgeons failed at UCLH colorectal team and St Mary's team to correctly carry out more tests to evaluate further?\nIn my experience there was poor medical testing at St Mary's Hospital Paddington for Colorectal Imaging, poor method of examination, poor knowledge of handling my specific rectal bleeding matter and no taking the time to think out of the box re diagnosing.\nI experienced total mayhem internally re administration as I discovered after preassessment for my exploratory op Last Nov 2013.

I am known to have bipolar affective disorder and receive psychiatric services from Coventry & Warwickshire Partnership NHS mental health trust.\n\nA little while ago I phoned West sector community mental health team CMHT. This team provide psychiatric care to me. I asked to speak to manager via mobile phone (my landline is not working currently).\nI wanted to speak to them prior to bank holiday Monday break.\n\nFinally around teatime the manager spoke to me briefly via mobile phone. They said they had been in meetings all day so could not talk to me earlier. My conversation focused entirely on why CMHT have decided staff treating me must visit me in pairs. I receive care services from social worker, community psychiatric nurse, support worker. I told manager I am not dangerous I do not carry a weapon. I feel uncomfortable knowing I can only be visited by minimum of 2 people. The visit feels formal rather then informal. In the event only one staff member is free to visit me I miss my scheduled visit from CMHT staff member.\n\nOn Friday afternoon managers reply via mobile phone perplexed me. It was a judgemental, discriminatory, unrefined, non empathetic response I received from the manager. 2 staff must visit you as staff report you give them different stories & you alter story. I asked manager what they meant. They told me you know what I mean. I asked if they meant I lied and he said yes. I told manager I didn't lie & to give me supporting evidence for their allegations together with name of staff making allegations. Manager made no response. I repeated my question & got no response. Manager then ended conversation.\nI have decided to terminate my receipt of psychiatric service provision from Coventry & Warwickshire Partnership NHS trust West sector CMHT.\nMy GP agreed tonight to provide me with community based psychiatric services. This is to replace CMHT psychiatric services.\nI have spoken to several organisations over last week in an attempt to determine my rights. Local police, local councillor, GP, RCN, A&E dept.

I would have been in great difficulties if my local police had not stepped in to support me over the bank holiday weekend. I greatly appreciate the opportunity they gave me to be logical, reason & reflect with them regards current events. The police helped me put my life events in perspective.\nIn my opinion psychiatric patients should not be told they are liars, fraudulent, thief's on a friday afternoon on Friday immediately before bank holiday weekend.

She wont go to A&E and the police can't make her, so they have to wait for the crisis team, who don't come or leave her.\nWe are very worred and we rang Camden Council, who told us to ring the Crisis Team in Camden, who told us that as she does not have a worker or a team they will not see her. Apparently people who are very mentally ill cannot see the crisis team if do not have a community team. They know her because people keeps telling them and she has been in hospital. And she neglects herself and there were 2 fires in her home because she was very very ill.\nThe police say the crisis team refuse to come out because our neighbour refuses to work with them or mental health workers and she has complained about them.\nThe police now come and don't call them sometimes as the police say they are useless and better the police calm the situation rather than call mental health crisis teams who don't come as she then disappears.\nShe is very unsafe sometimes and is letting strangers in to her home who take her things and then she gets paranoid and refuses to let anyone in. We are neighbours and so no one listens to us. Her family say they gave up asking for help as even when she was hearing voices telling her to kill herself they contacted this mental health Trust and no one came out (this happened lots of times and when they were children trying to care for her).\nNow she is ill again. Her friend had to remove dangerous items from her flat. There are people taking advantage of her. the mental health trust know this as we know people have contacted them. The police know and say mental health services are useless. Her family think mental health services at this trust are dangerous. Camden Council know because someone in the street had to contact them to make her home /garden safe and told them she was in need of help.\nShe has tried to kill herself 3 times and nearly died on other times when too unwell to know she is unsafe.\nI feel that the crisis teams in camden and in this trust are useless and dangerous. To tell someone they have to go or take someone to A&E is appalling and dangerous and how if the police can't make her can anyone else?\nShe thinks mental health workers are trying to kill her. This community thinks they will by being neglectful of her.\nI now believe that they won't change -it's been like this for a long time around here.", "Dear Ccrisis\r\nThank you for getting in touch and sharing this information with us, and indeed for caring for your neighbour. However, from what you write it is impossible for us to know who you are talking about.\r\nWe want to help this person urgently and to understand better what has happened, so can you please ring our Camden Crisis Team on 0203 317 6333 (North Camden) or on 0203 317 6850 (South Camden) and provide us with further information.\r\nThe teams have been briefed and are awaiting your call. In addition, having spoken to the team they are shocked that somebody has been excluded. They explained that if somebody has no ties or links with known MH services, then the team would be even more likely to attend and assess, so they are extremely disappointed that this may have happened.\r\nPlease get in touch on the numbers above so we can help your neighbour as soon as possible.\r\nIn response to the rest of your posting it is difficult for us to comment on its particulars with any great specificity as we would need further information, however we can talk in general about the care provided by our Crisis Teams.\r\nI hope the points below may be helpful for you, and for anybody else who reads this posting as patient care and safety is our top priority.\r\n- Camden Crisis teams (both North & South) accept referrals from service users, carers and families.\r\n- It isn't necessary for a service user to have a care co-ordinator or be cared for by a secondary care mental health team, or a community team in order to make a referral.\r\n- The Camden Crisis Teams work with people who are in an acute phase of their mental illness, and all referrals will be judged on their own merit based on the clinical and social factors associated with the individual case.\r\n- The Crisis Team will NOT exclude someone from care because the individual refuses to work with them. It can be difficult to treat someone if they do not consent to receiving care. However, in these circumstances the Crisis Team will work with the carers, families and other professionals to arrange alternative treatment if it is required.\r\n- The crisis team will not exclude someone from care because they have made a previous complaint about services or about any individual worker.\r\n- The crisis teams work closely with the police. Should the police come across an individual who is mentally unwell and in their own home \u2013 they can make a referral to mental health servicea (including the crisis steam) who will respond to the referral. The response to these referrals is swift and we work extremely closely with the police on these issues.\r\n- It is common for neighbours to raise the alarm should they be concerned about an individual by calling the Housing Office, the police or indeed an ambulance or social services.\r\nI really hope this is helpful and please contact our teams on the numbers above.\r\nThank you\r\nKarl", "As a family, we feel totally disappointed in the Mental Health System within Foundation House, Taunton.

I was put onto a drip to try and stop my labour but after several hours I developed chest pains and so the drip was stopped. \nI was constantly monitored and that evening I went into full labour and our son was born early the next morning. The neonatal doctor and nurses were there to attempt and intubate our son but all we kept hearing was that he wasn't viable. This went on for 13 minutes and eventually the Dr and the team stopped trying. The midwife wrapped our son up and passed him to me. I could see his chest rising and falling and shouted out that he was breathing and the Dr said that he wasn't. Dr and team then left the delivery room. Myself and my husband were angry that nothing more could be done and we expressed our anger to the midwife. The midwife left us to have some private time with our son and we had to wait and watch our son die which took 50 minutes. \nDr came back into the room and told us we were very lucky that the neonatal team came to try and save our baby because at 23 weeks they usually didn't bother and then left the room. We were both in complete shock that a Dr would even say to anyone what we had just heard. When the midwife came back into the room, we told her what had been said and she seemed astonished at what was said. We left that afternoon after taking our son to the chapel. The midwives could not have done any more for us than they did. They were very competent and professional but also sympathetic. \nOn the following Monday the lady from the bereavement team came to see us and talked to us in great detail about what would now happen and the services available to us. We talked to her about our experience in the delivery suite and she seemed ashamed that that was how we had been spoken to. We wanted to put a complaint in into the way our son had been treated or not as we feel. However we were told that if we wanted to do that then the death certificate couldn't be signed and our son would have to have a post mortem, which was something I didn't want to happen. Our son was perfect and we didn't want him cut into. We had consented to umbilical testing and my placenta tested and felt that that was enough. \nIn the eyes of myself and my husband we don't think that the Dr in question had done all they could to save our son because all the doctor kept saying was he's not viable he's not viable over and over again. We have been back to see my consultant and got the results of the tests carried out on the umbilical cord and placenta. The results were they found a large blood clot in the placenta and they feel that could have started my labour off prematurely. We expressed our feelings of future pregnancies and how I would be treated and a care plan has been put in place. \nI haven't been able to do this before now as I have really struggled to come to terms with our loss and only recently, after a complete meltdown, felt I needed to do this to help me move forward. After thinking back to the beginning of my pregnancy and my first appointment with the midwife and then Dr at Chorley Hospital, I was told by the midwife that I was high risk of blood clots and would probably be put on clexane injections every day from 16 weeks. However when I went into see the Dr he said I would only need clexane injections after the birth or if I was bed ridden. So I feel that if I had the clexane injections my story might have been so different. \nI am absolutely terrified now of future pregnancies and having to go to Preston Hospital for the birth. I will be asking to go to a different hospital for my treatment and birth as I couldn't risk having a premature baby and them being under the care of that Dr. I wouldn't be able to stop myself from telling the doctor exactly what I think of them and how they treated our son.", "Thank you very much for sharing your painful experience with us and for the very kind comments you made about the midwifery staff at what is a very difficult time for you and your family.\r\nWe're so sorry to hear of the loss of your baby son and would welcome the opportunity to discuss your concerns further with you and your husband if you feel that it would be helpful to do so.\r\nIf so, can I ask you to please contact the Customer Care Department on 01772 522521, who will make the arrangements for you to meet with relevant senior staff.", "My grandmother was admitted via A&E with hypoglycaemia.

She was then referred to Stapleford Care Centre with a mental health doctor, with the Iris team being bought in for assessments on mum late last year. There was a brain scan set for the new year. The Iris team I felt created havoc with everyone, myself and my future daughter in law did most of the care for mum, the Iris team didn't complete communication book we set up, left tablets out that we had set up in blister packs etc They were forever on the phone to me contradicting each other in what I was being told. For example, I was told not to buy mum any biscuits (this is virtually all she was eating at the time, even though I provided meals, fruit etc) as not good for her. So mum then didn't eat. Then I would get another one call me, saying they'd been out and bought biscuits to encourage mum to eat. \nThese were the 'higher end' people within the team not the actual day to day carers. There were so many issues you wouldn't believe. They said mum didn't assess badly. I don't know why. One of the assessors wouldn't even let us take notes. Why not? I begged to differ as mum was not in a good way, she wasn't looking after herself in anyway whatsoever and didn't know basic things. I got a call saying they were putting a 3 wheeled walker in for mum (she had a \u2018zimmer' she didn't use) I asked them not to put it in whilst I wasn't there but to leave until I was with her to show her how to use. To help make sure she would not fall (I work full time) but they put it in anyway, with notes stuck on pictures frames saying \"Use Frame\". I was surprised they did this for a dementia patient. \nWe were on the way back from City Hospital with my father in law (who has since died) to get a call from my daughter to say the carer had contacted her (we only live across the road from my mum) and she couldn't get in. Mum had left the key in the door and she was lying on the floor in the kitchen, shouting \u2018help me'. My daughter and the carer went to a neighbour to go over to mums back garden as we pulled up. My husband broke in to get to mum, who had fallen over the walker and broken her hip.\nShe was taken by ambulance to QMC for a plate and screw operation.\nAt around the same time there was a meeting set for the results of the brain scan with the mental health doctor at Stapleford Care Centre, I had a battle for this to go ahead without mum but they agreed. Five of us went to the meeting, to be told mum had moderate to severe vascular dementia, but as she was now in hospital, she would be taken off their assessment. Anyway, mum's hip was operated on but her mind seemed worse, the nurses at QMC spoke with me, mum was walking a little but doing things like switching all the lights off in the ward. I appreciate physical wards are not set for dementia patients. They explained the best thing for the best outcome would be rehabilitation at Lings Bar hospital. \nMum went to Lings Bar Hospital. Well, I don't know where to start and rehabilitation is not the word I would use. Mum was left sat in a chair with a buzzer under her bottom that went off every time she moved. She went downhill quite badly. She had severe leg pain which they scanned as concerned for  DVT but nothing on scan and so nothing done. They are supposed to elevate leg but every time we went (one of us daily) it wasn't. An assessment was done there without them saying anything to me as I found a brown envelope with details in it. Mum had been hiding tablets left with her, we said this to the staff many times. I continually got calls off the staff at Lings Bar saying they couldn't settle mum. This was often late in the evening and asked me if I would speak with her. I did but it didn't help as mum needs to have her hand held and see people. She also had a fall there but not given much info except a call to say fallen but OK. \nOne day I received a voicemail at 7. 30am whilst at work saying mum was aggressive and abusive and could I go and sit with her as they couldn't get their rounds done as having to spend time sitting with mum.  I was appalled to hear this message and tried calling back but to no avail as I couldn't leave work as it was my busiest day. The day before when I went to visit, they were all talking at the nurses' desk while mum was shouting for the toilet and she was ignored. So I took her myself.\nSeveral meetings were called then cancelled; eventually there was a full team multidisciplinary meeting. At this meeting the physio, a ward manager, the occupational therapist (who I had not seen or spoken with), a social worker from Lings Bar who had been given mums case on the day. \nI was in despair as six of us went up for this meeting and in my opinion no-one would listen to what we were saying, the outcome being mum couldn't come home with care as it would not be safe (I do agree on that point) but they said residential care only. I strongly disagreed with this as mum was on about her fourth water infection by this point. Her mental state seemed affected by this and she wasn't walking at all. They had not allowed her to even try to walk. She hid her tablets and wasn't eating. \nI felt I was not listened to and it broke my heart. I said I wanted mum in the right place and a forever home. I didn't want her moving again a month down the line. I was told that wouldn't happen. I was then left to tell mum myself what was happening. I felt it was as if the staff were then pushing to get her off the ward. We felt very pressured and we were told to go and look at residential care homes. We knew nothing and were just given a booklet! \nThe first home we went to was lovely but it was beyond our means (mum is not self-funding). I spoke with the social worker who said the home who refused her would not speak with him or the ward as to why they refused mum, so he had nothing to go on.\nAfter several calls I was told to go and look at a home the social worker had called and, if seemed nice, they would get an assessment done. We went the next morning and they assessed her that day and mum moved in. The care home called to say mum had eaten and walked. All seemed OK but I was concerned as mum didn't settle at all, she didn't seem to fit in. \nAt the beginning of the following month mum seemed again to get worse. She was not sleeping, was  very agitated and everyone was concerned. The care home said they would speak with her GP after the bank holiday. I received a call from the care home, they had the mental health doctor from Stapleford Care Centre to see mum, who had put her on a lot of medication and were sending her to hospital. I asked where and was put on to speak with the mental health doctor (this is not mums GP)who said she was going to King's Mill in Mansfield. I asked why there and was told there were no beds at the City Hospital assessment unit. I said I didn't want her going that far away as we live in Chilwell and that City Hospital would be difficult enough without being in Mansfield especially as hospitals have restricted times. The mental health doctor said it might be better if you didn't see her. I could not believe it at all. I lived across the road from my mum and saw and cared for her virtually every day until her fall at home. Then between us someone went every day to the hospital and the care home and to be told that.\nI said I wasn't having mum in there at all and the doctor said what are you going to do about it? I was so upset. We stopped our conversation and about an hour later I had a call from the care home that they had spoken with mums own GP and she was going to Bestwood Ward, in the St Francis Unit that evening. Mum went there quite late that night. Mum was assessed and taken off some medication. Obviously this is a secure unit and there are still assessments taking place between the mental health team and the mental incapacity team. Speaking with several members of staff I now know that what I felt wasn't right, really wasn't right.\nMum has been let down so badly. No wonder she is so bad as she had been moved 4 times in 10 weeks. We went to visit mum and were called in to see the consultant doctor of Bestwood Ward, along with another doctor, a nurse and someone else. They were trying to explain about getting legality behind mum for keeping her there and had altered her medication to try and calm her without over-sedation. However she now had an irregular heartbeat and there were concerns as to how to treat her with weighing up risk of heart problem against risk of stroke if warfarin was used. It is heart breaking.\nWhilst at Bestwood there someone came who was a 'best interest assessor' to try and get a DOLS act behind mum to keep her there legally. I did agree with this. They asked me all about what has been going off. It appears mum should have gone to B47 of QMC after her operation as this is a specific dementia ward at QMC, and that Lings Bar do not have sufficient dementia specialists to deal well with dementia patients. She asked me about the meetings and who attended. I told the DOLS assessor that the social worker was and what I had heard from them. I said I hadn't heard meeting was confirmed or not, I told her the name of the social worker that the mental health assessor thought it would be. The DOLS representative gave me lots of great advise and advised me to speak up and find out. \nI still hadn't heard anything at all so I called the number I had been given from the mental health assessor which is a unit for the NHS in Mansfield. I asked for the person who was not there so I left a message. I heard nothing so called back and someone answered who again I explained to that I needed to know about a social worker and if meeting was happening or not as I needed to book time off work. They gave me a mobile number for the person. I called it, for the mobile number to have been changed. I called the new number and left a message saying I needed information (as above). I received a call back from this person saying, meeting still not confirmed, it wasn't the social worker who they thought it would be but they didn't know who it was or even if there was one.\nAgain I was stressed and I was very concerned this was going just how the bad meeting was at Lings Bar and I needed time off work to book. This went on for a while until I said I wasn't at all happy and really concerned for mum's outcome yet again and I was getting frustrated. They were aware of what we had been through before. They gave me the number for Nottinghamshire County Council adult social services and told me to call them on Thursday. I called Thursday and was passed around and around, as no one knew anything. \nI left a message for someone to call me back \u2013 the title of this post was the 'best interest assessor' who I knew wasn't the correct person. They called me back and I apologised that it had ended up at their door as I knew it wasn't their responsibility. They checked all the notes etc and said the referral had gone to Broxtowe but no social worker as yet assigned and they believed that they weren't given cases until a Tuesday and this is when mums meeting was supposed to be. They said they could not however guarantee anything would be done but the said they hoped for my sake that it would. But safeguarding patients take priority (I do understand this). Hence the meeting did not take place that week. \nBestwood and assessors have all said mum will not be going back to the care home she was in as it wouldn't be suitable, however payment would still be made to them until the change of home was made, so mum will still be paying her big chunk too. Nottinghamshire Council told me the contract was between them and the care home and therefore I couldn't cancel it and they couldn't until someone higher told them to. All this when where she is I cannot get often enough in their visiting times and have to pay laundry service for her clothes at \u00a310 a time (every 2 days) whilst it seems to me the care home is sitting pretty. I can only get 2 sometimes 3 times a week without booking time off work.\nI feel so guilty that mum has gone through this. She hasn't had the chance to settle anywhere whatsoever and there will be another move soon. I really could cry for how much mum has had to go through. I would do anything for my mum, I don't have much money, I haven't got a loud voice and I am now in despair for my mum. It just seems (in our case anyway) that mental health is not important. My father in law who recently passed away had a physical health problem and has had the best of care in comparison. It really is so unfair.\nBestwood ward is fantastic, the staff know their patients and they communicate, but I understand this ward, along with Daybrook, is closing in about 4 weeks. The aim is to set up more care in the community by IRIS teams. I hope no one ever has such a bad experience as mum has been put through with the Iris Team and all that followed.\nOn a plus note, this evening I have received a call from a social worker for mum, lots of advise and support, the care home will be cancelled and have meeting set.\nSo hoping mum can now have the proper care she deserves and a forever home.\n", "So I was bang on my due date with my second baby when I went into labour, my contractions were painful and very regular getting progressively closer. I went into the hospital at 4 cm dilated (I managed to hold out to 7 cm with my first baby), the pain was just too intense. I was examined and given 2 paracetamol, upon explaining to the midwife that I needed something stronger she just looked at me and said that it was too early. \n15 minutes later and more very painful very regular contractions I buzzed again, it took ages for anyone to respond eventually a healthcare assistant attended and I asked for some pain relief, she explained they were short staffed and went to find a midwife. The same midwife attended and said my labour wasn't progressed enough to have gas and air, she did not examine me and left. \n20 minutes later in tears and scared I buzzed again, I was practically screaming and I begged for pethidine or anything they could give me I just needed something. She said she'd give me gas and air and would go get some pethidine as well but would need another midwife to sign for it. \nEventually she came back and they gave me the pethidine, immediately afterwards I started to push, she was washing her hands and I told her I needed to push. She told me not to be silly and at this point I lost my temper, I told her I was pushing and I could not stop it, low and behold she examined me (only the second time since arriving on the labour ward) and I was ready to push but my babies head had come down behind the cervix leading to the midwife having to physically push my babies head back up the birth canal and manoeuvre it in front of the cervix, the pethidine had not taken effect yet!\nIt was during this time the midwife told me to 'be quiet and shut up' 4 contractions later my 9lb 7oz baby was on my chest and I was in complete shock. A family member of mine is a midwife but had opted against being around for the birth in case of complications, she came in about 15 minutes after I had delivered, she was holding the baby talking to my husband and I was on the phone to my mother, I suddenly felt wet and warm gushing from my vagina. I ended the phone conversation and told my family member I thought I was bleeding, she pulled back the sheets and pulled the emergency buzzer, I was then surrounded by lots of people having injections in my legs, medication pushed up my bottom, cannula in both hands and my stomach massaged frantically. I remember the pad under me being removed and the blood pored into a jug in the bathroom, I was in complete shock and shaking. \nOnce the bleeding stopped the medical team disappeared as fast as they had arrived leaving me with my new baby and husband and feeling like crap. I was left in that room until morning when I insisted that I get moved to the midwife led unit in Alnwick where I would be given some TLC. \nThe birth has traumatised me I am due to give birth to my 3rd child in 7 weeks and I am so scared that the same thing will happen, I thought I had dealt with how the birth had left me but I obviously haven't.", "Dear Madam,\r\nCan I begin by saying how extremely sorry and saddened I am that you have had this experience during the birth of your second baby. It is very concerning to know that you felt traumatised by this experience. I can absolutely understand why this is preying on your mind now that your third baby is due very soon.\r\nI have been in touch with Lynn Tilley our matron for maternity services. She is also very concerned by your comments and wants to help. I would be very grateful if you could get in touch with her as soon as possible.\r\nThe care you describe is completely unacceptable - we would never expect any of our staff to behave in this way or to be so disrespectful when caring for an anxious mum in labour.\r\nYou can appreciate why we'd want to act immediately to investigate the care you received during the birth of your second baby and also to ensure that you feel fully supported for the remainder of your pregnancy.

There are always lessons we can learn from patient and relative experiences both within our own hospitals and those that occur outside and would therefore be very interested in listening to your story.

You can contact us via PALS@ngh.nhs.uk.", "What I am about to tell you, you may find upsetting. But this is what has happened to me. It may not be the experience of others and if you have had a good experience in a crisis, I am sure you can share it in the workshops this afternoon. If by what I say, I may trigger you then this is not my intention please try and not judge me too harshly and please don't tell me that I did these things just to be an attention seeker- there are better ways to get attention, I can tell you, than trying to kill yourself.\nI spent my working life as a probation officer. Following an assault in Cyprus I developed post-traumatic stress disorder which then developed into a deep depression, and since then I have been diagnosed with rapid cycling bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder. I am, what you might call, a repeat offender, in that in the last 13 years I have experienced numerous suicidal crises. I want to give you a composite of what happens if you have a mental health crisis.\nSo\u2026. You may have been dealing with suicidal thoughts for some time and have tried to keep yourself safe using various means, like distraction, being around others, going to public places, taking tranquillisers and sleeping tablets. But what if all the tablets have been used up and its night and you can't go anywhere to be safe? There may come a time when your energy to fight these thoughts is so low you don't think you can resist acting on the thoughts anymore. In the past when I have got to this point I have started drinking alcohol with a wish to either pass out unconscious or die. Because If I can't pass out I will not care enough to keep fighting the thoughts and can try and kill myself. As you will \u201clet my god decide if I should live or die\u201d, a form of Russian roulette with the fates. Some of my suicidal acts have been planned at other times impulsive. I am not proud of what I have done, as after each attempt I have felt feel humiliated, embarrassed and ashamed. I have caused pain for my friends who have felt helpless, confused, powerless, frustrated and angry.\nWhen you try to kill yourself you are not thinking of the consequences, you just want out of life. At times, you may be aware that you are a danger to yourself. Once when I asked for help to keep me safe, my social worker asked the crisis team to come over, they said they could not come to my home until the next day at noon, I did everything I could to stay safe for those 24 hours. When the crisis team arrived I said I was not safe, I had thought of killing myself and not wanting to burden others with my cat, I said I had even thought of killing my cat. This thought scared me and I did not want to kill my beloved pet. The response I got from the man who was there was that he shouted at me that I was \u201cselfish\u201d. I said I was not selfish, if I was selfish, I would have just done it and not thought of the pain I would cause others.\nThey told me that I didn't need to be in hospital and tried to dissuade me from asking any more, so I called my support worker, who told them I had been very depressed and would never normally ask to be hospitalised and that I needed to be in hospital, that I was NOT safe. They told her I would not be taken to hospital and besides there were no beds available anyway, but that they were planning to call the RSPCA to have my cat taken away. They were more concerned with the welfare of my cat than my welfare, how ironic!\nAnother time when I knew I was at risk I phoned the crisis team. I said \u201cI am at risk and need to be in hospital\u201d they said to take a tranquilliser and phone them back in 5 hours if it did not work. Well 5 hours is long time to wait if you're suicidal. But I did phone them, (after all I always keep my promises) and told them I had already taken an anticoagulant and cut myself. They did nothing. They did not even call the police to do a welfare check. I did not die as you can see but only because I had not waited long enough for the anti-coagulate to work.\nAnother time I told my community psychiatric nurse, I needed a respite bed, somewhere to be safe, where I could talk or just be. But the only respite bed in Suffolk was booked up months in advance.\nSo, you're in crisis, you've been fighting the thoughts of killing yourself all day and it gets to the evening. Your community psychiatric nurse has told you to phone the crisis team when you're at substantial risk. When I have done this in the past some of their comments such as \u201cgo have a cup of tea, a bath, go for a walk, watch TV, \u201d have only brought me more frustration and anger. This escalates the situation. You phone the Samaritans, or you may call the crisis team again and they say \u201cI'm sorry I only have a few minutes to talk to you as I have an assessment to do here at the hospital, so put your worries in an imaginary box and you'll feel better\u201d.\nYou may call the Samaritans again, who are really lovely people, but they can't give you advice. You don't want to call friends because you don't want to burden them or worry them, besides it's in the middle of the night. You already feel such a worthless human being, not even worthy enough to breathe another person's air. You are desperate and so you attempt to take your life, you've had enough, you just want out. You may be discovered by accident, or have a rational, lucid moment and call for help, you may wake up alive, and either way\u2026 other people now know.\nYour friends might try and persuade you to go to accident and emergency. If they can't persuade you, they might call the police to do a \u2018welfare check'. You might be able to persuade the police you're safe.\nOr your friend might take you to accident and emergency where you're put in a room. Your friend can't cope, your banging your head literally against the wall. The Sister in charge of Accident and emergency department is insisting the mental health team attend but they say to her \u201cput her in the cells, she is drunk and only has herself to blame\u201d. The Sister is refusing to call the police, she won't let a mentally unwell person be put in the cells. Your friend might plead and beg for you to be sedated but you're not. Because you need to see the crisis team first.\nYou might phone the crisis team and if you have already hurt yourself they may send an ambulance or tell you to get yourself to accident and emergency (I have tried this before when in a taxi and tried to jump out of it, my friend stopped me). You might even be persuaded by the Samaritans for them to call an ambulance. Your neighbour may have seen you in the street and called an ambulance, and they may wait for an hour and a half for one to arrive.\nOnce you get to accident and emergency you may be seen by a doctor who says \u201cdo you feel hopeless and helpless\u201d, you say \u201cno\u201d, because once you get released you plan to finish the job. But you can't go once the doctor has seen you, as you have to wait to see the mental health team, this can take hours. The longest period I had to wait was 12 hours when the mental health team \u201cforgot\u201d I was there, but it can take usually up to 6 hours. You are not given any tranquillising medication while you wait so your desperation and agitation increase, the stress may cause you to start hallucinating.\nSomeone once told me they passed out from taking an overdose and a nurse told their friend \u201cwell what did she expect she took the tablets she will wake up eventually\u201d. You wake up - still no assessment- you have a panic attack and run away. Or your friend is told that they can go, as you will be admitted to psyche ward, and they go, and you're on your own, waiting and waiting, you get frightened you, run away. Or you may be guarded by security staff, who get annoyed by babysitting \u201cyet another mental health case\u201d. You may be left in cubicles and surrounded by over stimulating beep sounds and the hustle and bustle of a busy department you can't cope with the noise so you, run away.\nYou may see the mental health team after a 6 hour wait, you are stammering and can't get the words out, they say \u201cif you can't speak to us properly, we won't talk to you\u201d- your crying, you run away. The mental health team may guilt-trip you into going home because\u201d your cats not fed\u201d, or they say \u201cyou self-manage so well\u201d.\nAccident and emergency staff may come up to you and berate the mental health team for taking so long. You know you're making them frustrated. You feel guilty so you, run away.\nYou may be guarded by the hospital staff waiting for the mental health team, you over hear one nurse say to another \u201cI've been brought down from theatre to do this stint\u201d, you feel so guilty that you have caused this that you, run away. You might be prevented from leaving by accident and emergency staff, so you wait some more and more and more. You can't bear it anymore, you wait for their back to be turned and you, run away.\nIF you run away, the accident and emergency staff have no option but to call the police, it's their policy. En route to your home, you may have hid in peoples gardens so that you won't be caught. If you continue to hide in peoples gardens the police will put up a helicopter to search for you. So you go home.\nThe police arrive at your house and try and persuade you to open the door. Eventually they threaten to break down your door. You don't want to upset your landlord by the damage to the door, so you let the police in. They might act kindly towards you or they may, out of frustration, start phoning randomly the contacts in your phone, telling people that you have not seen for years, that you're suicidal. They may contact the mental health team who tell them your sister is your next of kin. If, for example, your sister doesn't pick up the phone (after all it is 2. 30 in the morning), they will go and wake her up. She will be angry, and phone you the next day to tell you that the \u201cpolice have better things to do than waste their time on you, when they could be catching criminals\u201d, she never speaks to you again.\nThe police, at your home, may try to convince you to go to the hospital. They call an ambulance, all your meds are taken out of your house, your keys, phone and your cigarettes. You're so afraid that in the ambulance you stand up to make to jump out the back. The Paramedics say, \u201cKeep breaking sharply that will make her sit down\u201d, they keep calling you Catherine, but your name now sounds like \u201ccathy run\u201d. So you manage to jump out of the moving ambulance and the police car is following. They jump on you and hand cuff you and put you back into the ambulance. You arrive in accident and emergency, in handcuffs, embarrassed, feeling like a criminal.\nOr the police, at your home, may try to persuade you to walk outside your home, then carry out a section 136, (you can't be sect 136 at home). They put you in the police car. They call the mental health team who say \u201cif she has drunk alcohol we won't see her till she is alcohol free\u201d so the disgruntled police have no option but to take you to the police cells.\nAt the cells you get searched, have your personal items removed and put in a cell with a mattress on the floor. If the police man is a friend you went to school with, they may sit at the door of the cell talking to you kindly, telling you to ignore the voices and making conversation to distract you from the voices in your head that are telling you \u201cyou should be dead, you failed, next time hang yourself\u201d. You will then be breathalysed repeated until free of alcohol then, 6 hours later, you are taken to the section 136 suite at the woodlands unit in the hospital.\nYou then have to wait again, without medication, for the assessment team. You may have headache but no one will give you Paracetamol, there is no doctor to prescribe it. You don't get offered a drink and you are put into a brightly lit room that is over heated. No one comes to talk to you to ask you why you tried to kill yourself. You may overhear the lone nurse there, telling their colleagues on the phone, \u201d she is agitated but ok\u201d. You try and keep it together, as so far you've been treated like a criminal and just want to get home. You ask if you can have a drink. The nurse sighs as if you're a nuisance and gets you a drink of water, you wait for the assessment team. You ask if you can go to a low lit room because the bright lights and extreme heat are making you feel worse, so they put you in a freezing cold bedroom next door. You try and calm down, your shaking now with the cold and come out to ask for a hot drink You are tutted at by the nurse who reluctantly makes you a hot drink. Its now3. 30am. You're exhausted, you just want to get home, get to your sedating meds. You may ask for your property as you don't know what you have got. Cigarettes? \u201cWe can't give you the package with your property in it\u201d says the nurse.\nThe mental health assessment team arrive and ask you questions that make you angry. You try and convince them you're safe to go home. You're so tired and agitated. They offer you the home treatment team but they can't explain what the home treatment team will do for you. They let you go, but you have to ask them if they can call for a taxi as you have no phone.\nSometimes if you ask for it, the taxi can be paid on account or if not offered it, you walk home. You may have to break into your home or wake your neighbour, up who has a key to the house. It's now 4am and they are not best pleased.\nYou get home but they have taken all your meds, so you can't help yourself calm down. You want to phone the hospital for your property but the number is in the mobile that you can't find because they didn't tell you they took it. You try and look for your cigarettes but they didn't tell you they took them too. You might be lucky and have another phone at home and you might be lucky if the hospital security guard brings round your property at 5am, or, you might be unlucky and never get your property back.\nOn another occasion when taken to the 136 suite at Woodlands there were no mental health staff available. The police said as there were no staff, I needed to be taken to the cells. I begged them not to take me, so they waited with me in the 136 suite until a mental health worker was free. It took hours.\nIf you wake up alive on the medical assessment ward or the surgical ward, you may ask to be NFR (not for resuscitation). The Doctor will put you on 72 hour section and then you will be watched constantly by a nurse, who is very kind and will say things like \u201cwhy did you try and kill yourself you have so much to live for\u201d or, \u201conly god should take a life\u201d, or \u201cwhat will your friends think had you succeeded, they would have been devastated\u201d, you persuade the nurses that you were foolish, you did a stupid thing and wont to it again, you need to make THEM feel better.\nYou may be seen by a psychiatrist who suggests you need to go into hospital you tell him \u201cbut I have a borderline diagnosis my experience is they won't put you in hospital\u201d, he says \u201cyes but you do have a bipolar diagnosis and you should be there, but the crisis team have to see you first\u201d. They (the mental health crisis team) come and guilt trip you into going home, \u201cwell your cats not been fed for over 24hours now and you do have an appointment with your G. P. tomorrow which you should keep\u201d. Your carer or friend may phone them and say \u201cshe is not safe, don't discharge her\u201d. But because you feel so guilty that the cats not been fed, and made to feel a nuisance, you tell them you will go home.\nThey may offer you a crisis bed but that would only be for 2 nights, that's 30 hours, and they tell you you won't have your treatment reviewed there. The carer is told \u201c\u201dwell Cathy has chosen to go home and only SHE is responsible for her safety\u201d. The carer is left feeling angry, worried and frustrated.\nWhen you wake up alive in the surgical ward you might not have your clothes on, you're in a hospital gown, and you don't have any property. You can't phone someone because you have no phone and can't remember the numbers on it. The medical ward may say that you are medically fit to be discharged. You go home in hospital scrubs with a bag of blood clotted, cut up clothes and no shoes or socks. You call the Freephone number at the hospital for a taxi, and because you have no money on you, the taxi driver follows you into your house for his money. You have no meds, they've been taken by the ambulance. Your traumatised, you clean up the blood stained carpet and cry.\nIf you have tried to kill yourself in a public place, the police may section you. If the police have sectioned 136 you, the police may have to wait for you to be medically fit to be discharged, as the mental health team won't see you until your medically fit to be discharged.\nThe police may have to change shifts 3 times for the length of time it takes for them to be able to hand your care over to the mental health services. It's been over 14 hours now that they have had to \u201cbabysit\u201d you. You are awake the whole time and hallucinating. They may be kind to you, but very frustrated by having to be with you. You pick up on this and feel very guilty.\nAt Accident and Emergency you may be placed in cubicles and only feel safe laying or kneeling on the floor, this way you can't sink any lower. Someone passes the cubicles and remarks to the police officer sitting outside \u201csomeone should tell her meccas the other way\u201d. The doctor arrives, you can't get up from the floor. The police officer shouts at you to get up as the doctor is here. You can't, only the floor is safe and cool, so she grabs the back of your collar and drags you up.\nOne day I phoned the access and assessment team for medication advice, and no one answered so I left a message on the answer phone. They did not phone back. After 45 minutes I called 111. It says on the poster \u2018if you need urgent advice but it's not an emergency call 111' - Don't phone 111 if you're in a crisis and only need medication advice. If they ask you why you want medication advice and you say you are having suicidal thoughts and just need to know how much more anti-psychotic or tranquilliser you can take, don't phone 111. Because they will always send an ambulance, even though you tell them you don't want or need one. The ambulance arrives, the first responder arrives, and the police arrive. You are telling them all you just need medication advice and don't need to go to hospital. They will tell you their job is only to get you to hospital. You go to hospital in the police car and sit in the waiting room flanked by two police officers. Everyone in the waiting room is staring at you, your stress levels have gone up to such a point you become delusional and start hallucinating. You think you have been brought to the hospital to heal the sick. The police leave. There are too many people to heal so what do I do\u2026yeah your right. YOU RUN AWAY.\nSo what has helped me keep alive your probably asking.\n1. The Samaritans, they will listen, and offer to phone you back in an hour or the next day. If the local office is open they will tell you that you can go down there and meet someone face to face.\n2. The police, who sit with you while you wait, who want to help, but they are not social workers or doctors or mental health professionals. There are the kind ones, like my old school friend who talked to me, persuaded me to get in the ambulance, gave me a cigarette and told me that I wasn't wasting their time.\n3. My support worker, who says things like \u201cwell you can't kill yourself you need to sign my time sheets on Monday\u2026\u201d and my friends who remove the knives and pills from the house.\n4. My reasons to live list compiled when I am well. Those things that I have not yet done.\n5. Medication. Many a time I've taken sleeping tablets and tranquillisers to knock me out and provide the respite from the thoughts that only sleep can bring.\n6. My GP who shows care and empathy, never judges me, and wants for me to get well. Who will see me urgently and frequently, or his colleagues who will phone me when he is not there to say they are concerned about me.\nBUT there are those nights when, alone, frightened and terrified that you may not resist the urge any more\u2026 there are\u2026\u2026\u2026 those nights\u2026\n", "Apparent lack of care and many errors resulted in tragedy.

The ambulance paramedics were brilliant & they assessed my mum quickly & determined she needed to go to hospital. We got to hospital in the morning (8am) & were there most of the day while they ran tests. They then wanted to discharge my mum &, as I was helping her dress, she collapsed into my arms. My sister told the consultant that she wasn't happy about mum being discharged & they said she needed a drip. \nShe rallied & we took her home.\nHowever she continued to be very unwell overnight & so we took her to our GP & told her what had happened at the hospital. My mother had extremely low blood pressure & the GP phoned the hospital & virtually had to beg them to see her as they didn't seem to want to know. The GP argued it was a failed discharge. \nWe took my mum back to A&E and the doctor we saw seemed very dismissive, saying that if it wasn't for the fact my mum was in the day before, they would be sending her home. \nMy mum by this point had yellow eyes which even I had noticed. I ended up telling the doctor that I lived with my mother & even though I was not a doctor even I could see she was very ill & could they humour me by taking her in. The doctor reluctantly admitted my mum who deteriorated overnight. \nIt turns out she actually had gallstones trapped in her bile ducts & sepsis & was seriously ill. Even though I was very disappointed with her treatment in A&E, & apart from one really rude member of staff in the Acute Medical Ward, I could not fault the treatment of the staff on level 9 digestive diseases where even the consultant came in on his day off to operate on my mum. \nShe has since made a complete recovery despite her treatment in A&E and the fact that if they had sent her home I think she may have died.", "Gave birth to my third son at 7. 01pm, my husband was not given the option to hold his new son and told he had to leave by 7. 30pm. I needed stitches but as it was a shift change over this could not be done straight away.. instead I was told to stay where I was on my own on the bed id just given birth in all the mess until a new midwife came back and done my stitches at 9pm! ! !\nWas not allowed a shower and transferred straight to victoria ward where I was told to go to sleep and shower in the morning. Next morning when the midwife/nurse done her rounds when she realised I was bottle feeding she replied oh you don't matter and turned her back on me. My notes were never transferred from labour ward so I was not discharged until late afternoon when they eventually found my notes. At home it was becoming more painful to urinate and felt like something was hanging out.. very scary. My husband passed a mirror and I found a wad of gauze stuck inside me from the stitches the night before. Absolutely disgusting that it had been left there and how dangerous it could have been if I had not found it. I told the community midwife when she visited and she said she would speak to the sister on ward but that was all I ever heard.\nI'm currently due my 4th baby in feb 2015 & am refusing a hospital birth as my last was so horrendous. I feel safer at home than being put at risk by slack procedures in hospital.", "Dear rightsawareness\r\nWe read the posting about the services you describe where you mentioned our Trust and I am sorry you feel let down by them. The services you refer to are not run by us, but by Coventry and Warwickshire, so I am afraid we cannot respond to the points you have made.\r\nWe wish you well for your future and your ongoing care and treatment.\r\nNottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust", "Since writing my last story which refers to events of last year I have again been seriously unwell and have again been refused access to out of hours mental health services and the only reason I was in a better position to deal with this relapse than I was that last year I took matters into my own hands and made a medication crisis plan with the head of pharmacy in a meeting with her in July last year which I set up myself. Without this 45 minute meeting I would have been in exactly the same position as I was a year ago and probably would have ended being sectioned again.\n\nI recently I walked out of a meeting with a social worker when he told me he had assessed me as having no need of social work and in a crisis I could access the crisis team. This social worker has written an assessment that says many things that are simply untrue as he did not know me so did not know how I present as unwell and it seems to me has been highly selective in what he chose to include in his assessment. He also begins by saying that there are no capacity issues but he does not say how he knows this. I did not understand that what he was doing was an assessment as at the time I was being sent appointment letters I was actually too unwell to be able to read or retain any information so all I could do was look at the information in bold which gave the time and the name and turned up at this time. \n\nAlso at my appointment with the consultant at which he was present and was the first time I met him I was told that we would be working together on a care plan and this is also what it says the in letter to my GP. I think I have right to be confused that he then told me what he was doing was an assessment. No one has worked with me on a care plan since I wrote my first story, despite the fact that under the Welsh assembly measure I have a legal right to a care plan. My advocate has been faxed a copy of a document that is supposedly my care plan, however it is complete blank apart from 2 pieces of information, one of them being my current dose of mediation which is already out of date. Although producing a blank document may in some sense satisfy the legal requirement this is hardly in the spirit of the measure.\n\nAt the appointment where I first met this social worker I told my consultant clearly that I had needed to implement the crisis plan I had made with the head of pharmacy and was therefore on the maximum dose of medication and not only that I had also needed the maximum dose of lorazapam. I thought giving a consultant psychiatrist this information would be enough for her to realise that I was seriously unwell. Apparently not as she did not offer me a follow up appointment simply telling me that I was doing very well. In all my subsequent contact with the social worker I assumed that he knew I was seriously unwell and dealing with a psychosis however when I spoke to him on the phone following a terrifying bank holiday weekend during which I had started to get insight into the fact that he I had been paranoid and hearing voices he told me that I had been completely well while I had been under their team. This made me feel even worse to realise that they as a team had not picked up anything that had actually been happening to me and made me feel even more frightened. \n\nI found the phone call completely unhelpful so I went to the team to try and see the duty worker even though at the beginning of my psychosis the lead CPN had ordered me to leave the building when he and a member of his team had been unable to even introduce themselves without resorting to rude bullying tactics which I have complained to the nursing and midwifery council about since they frightened me so much when I was already unwell. And they went on to deny me access to the crisis team that day but they did not actually know what was happening to me as as I have said they were not even to able to introduce themselves.\n\nI was denied to the duty worker on the occasion after the bank holiday being told she was dealing with an emergency. I was not told that I could wait. I would have accepted that I might need to wait a long time and that she might not have much time but I was flatly refused access and only offered another phone call with the social worker who I had already found completely unhelpful and felt really let down that he had not understood that I was unwell in any of my previous contact with him.\nI have also been to A and E twice during this last relapse. I was trying to be very clear with professionals about what I could and could not deal with. I was having serve short term memory problems which is something that happened to me for the first time last year. This has serious implication for how I can deal with a relapse as with this problems it is very difficult for me to manage my medication safely myself.\n\nOn the first occasion I had been forced to call an ambulance as my phone call to the GP out of hours service had resulted in them saying that if I could accept a call back due to the fact that my phone was faulty I could not access their service. I tried to ask if they could send a taxi for me to attend their service in person but they refused saying they did not have the authority to do this. I tried to ask them to go the person with that authority to ask them but t hey refused leaving me no option then accept of calling an ambulance.\n\nThe paramedics were extremely rude, hostile and unhelpful. They could have helped me resolve the problem in my home if they had been prepared to be kind and calm. They could have helped me locate my medication and sort out what I had taken and what I had not. Instead they were rude and bulling and angry with me for calling an ambulance and wasting money. As I have already explained I was forced into doing this. They told me there was nothing they could do as there were other places for people like me and if they took me to A and E there was nothing they could do for me there and they would just send me home. This is not true that there are other places for people like me, this an offensive, stigmatising and degrading way to talk to a mentally ill person. We still do access the health service in the same way as everyone else, through GPs and A and E. I waited for hours in a private room and I did feel calmer and safer that I handed over all my medication and although I would have to wait I thought I would get appropriate help. When I did see a doctor he told me all he could do was send me home. I was alone and very ill. Having waited that long why did he not refer to he duty psychiatrist? He was simply confirming what the paramedics had said that all they would do was send me home. How on earth is someone in my position supposed to get help? I was then supposed to wait for a taxi but I found the environment I had to wait in too chaotic and scary so I said I would walk home as by that time it had started to get light. However I was not really safe on my own and a very good friend who gets up early drove to a bus stop and came and took me home and helped me phone the GP when they were open.\n\nThe second occasion it was the out of hour GP who arranged an ambulance as I had taken an accidental overdose which I think is evidence of how hard I was finding it to mange this situation myself which by that point I think had gone on for over 2 months. On that occasion the paramedics, both female was totally professional and kind and helpful. They told me that if they took me to A and E they could try and arrange for me to wait in a private room which is what I had done on the previous occasion. I understood they could not guarantee this as many things can be happening in A and E but they said it was actually fairly quiet for a Saturday night.\nThe room turned out not to be available but I agreed to wait as the waiting area at that point was empty. I wanted and saw a male nurse and did my best to explain things to him. I found him hostile for no reason. He asked for the name of my next kin which I gave him along with a comment because my dad has the same name as a famous person and I wanted to clarify that I had given the correct name. His response was to ask me very coldly the same question again. I had already answered and I found this very intimidating.\n\nI waited again but other people were now waiting as well and because I was still unwell which is one reason why I had made the mistake with my medication I found it harder to wait and the other people asked me questions like how long had I been waiting and I found it hard to interact with strangers in the state I was in. I then got called by a female nurse who said she was doing to do a heart trace. Her manner was bullying and as she started to touch me and do what needed to be done I started to cry, not just a bit but real sobs and this was because of my 16 years experience of terrible treatment from nurses within this trust, some of which are mentioned in my previous story. She did not stop or offer any reassurance, instead she just said in a bored bossy voice why are you crying. I said because I did not like people touching me when I am not well. She responded by saying why are you saying you are unwell. To me this just shows how inadequate the care is. \n\nI was there because I had taken an accidental over dose of anti psychotic drug and a nurse who is supposed to be trained professional was unable to make the link that I might be psychotic and hallucinating, hearing voices, having any number of experiences that might make it difficult for someone I don't know to touch me. I felt like saying why are you a nurse if you have no compassion or sense. She said well we're just doing this and continued even though I was sobbing really badly. As soon as she finished I was still crying so I asked where the toilets were. She showed me and I tired to compose myself so I could wait again in the public waiting area. I could not regain composure and when I came out I thought someone might notice that I was very distressed but all that happened was that there was now a queue for the toilet so they were annoyed with me for being in there so long. I tired to wait but I also knew that if I had to wait hours and hours in the long run this would be bad for my mental health because I knew that what I really needed was sleep. \n\nI went to the nurses station and waited a respectful distance away but I was ignored until someone came back from a break. I tired to explain that waiting a long time would be bad for me and if this was going to be the case it would be better for me to leave. I was not trying to queue jump. I knew there could be any number of things going on that I did not know about. I just wanted to know if I was going to have to wait hours so I could make the decision to leave if this was going to be the case. She said she would let one of the doctors know and get back to me. More and more people were now arriving and I was finding the waiting room area really hard to be in. No one had got back to me so I went and asked again if it was possible to wait somewhere else. They said no it wasn't. In the end I made the decision to leave without seeing a doctor, partly because I knew waiting hours with no sleep would be bad for my mental health and partly because the unfeeling hostile attitude of the nurses was making me feel very afraid and reminding me of all my negative experiences, especially those in hospital last year.\n\nI had a planned appointment with my consultant soon after this and explained that I had taken an accidental overdose.\n\nAt this appointment I also tired to explain that I had psychotic symptoms probably that point for about 3 months. My Dad was with me and said he thought I did make it clear. The social worker was also present and by that time it had already been decided that I would have no input form social work and I was not well enough to put in writing my thoughts on the assessment. lots of it was just downright wrong and also in my view it was incomplete as we did not have time to discuss the practical needs I have running my home where I live alone. And partly there was no time because I spent a lot of the second appointment trying to explain that I had been psychotic and I said that I might well have told him everything was wonderful at the first appointment but that is because I was manic. None of this discussion is included in the written report of the assessment. There was also a female staff member present who I think was introduced the first time as a social work assistant. However no one introduced on the second occasion which was a few weeks later. It seemed to be assumed that I could remember who she was. However I could not as I had been unwell the first time I met her.\n\nI have now been given access to psychological input and although this is very useful and helpful I do feel angry that I have to wait 18 years for this despite accepting a referral from my consultant when I first came out of hospital when I was 20 for a service that involved a psychologist and another professional visiting the family at home. I had to wait 6 months for this as the service was facing a cut which although did not happen caused a 6 month delay and ultimately they were no help, only being patronising and I regret it as this was my first contact with that team and it ultimately led to the serious professional misconduct which resulted in a CPN resigning. I only have the opportunity for this psychologist input now because I am not being seen by the team for my area. If I was I would still only have the option of the same psychologist. I asked again for psychological input approximately 15 years ago and all I was received was 2 or 3 sessions and I felt patronised again as I had by him before and after these appointment out of which I got nothing he discharged me again. The psychologist I am seeing now who I am finding very helpful has now told me we will be working together for at least a year. Although I am glad and grateful for the opportunity now I will never get the past 18 years back and it is too late for me now to have a family which maybe could have been possible if I had had this type of input earlier.\n\nDespite everything I have written here I still have no care plan and my GP has been told when she contacted my consultant to ask how we are supposed to handle a relapse that there are many drug options and she will not commit to anything now and will see me on an emergency basis if I am unwell. This is basically a disaster. She does not understand how quickly I can become very unwell and if I become unwell again at a weekend as I did last year we will be back in the same situation. Also I would very much like to know what she thinks these many drug options are since a referral to the academic team around 2 years or so the only options were the drug I am on now or clozoapine. This makes me wonder if she is saying this without being familiar with my medication history? This has already happened with another consultant who told me confidently we could try a drug I had already tried 10 years previously but had been unable to tolerate it.\n\nThe ombudsman are now investigating my complaint regarding the events of last year.\nHowever I feel forced to post again with the events of this year as I feel the standard of the mental health services I am being offered, apart from the psychologist are so low as to be completely useless to me. However my illness is serious and I am fearful of ending up sectioned again or if they take as long to section me as they did last year I could die before they get round to it and if I am going to end up sectioned on a regular basis my quality of life will be so low that I may decide suicide is a better option. And I know it is all unnecessary as I did keep myself out of hospital for 17 years when I had the right input from dedicated professionals.\n", "I was under a surgeon for 17 years, then when something happened b4 and after my operation he discarded me like I was nothing. I had 3 hip replacements and 1 hip revision. The last time, they didn't seem to know what they were doing. I was screaming as the doctors put a tube down my neck and a needle in my spine. I was supposed to be asleep when they did it. I ended up in intensive care for 5 days at wigan hospital, as there was no resus team at the weekend. \nAfter leaving intensive care, they moved me to a gynae ward. They didn't know what to do with me. I had to show them how to lift me. Then the next day, I had to phone Wrightington and pretend I was someone else and got through to my ward so they would send an ambulance as they had declined all day. \nSince then I have had no apology. I got thrown off the list and now have PTSD and have tried to commit suicide twice. I am terrified of hospitals now, so what happens to me when my hip needs doing again? \nI hope they are proud of the suffering they have caused.

Most of her time has been as an inpatient on Ward 5 where there is no permanent Consultant. The system in place changes the Ward Consultant every Monday. This has resulted in numerous changes in treatment for my sister as one Consultant changes the decisions made by the previous Consultant. It's as if they all believe the previous decisions are wrong and they know better than their peers. This has resulted in a total lack of continuity of care, poor standards and quality of treatment. I'm convinced had the doctors not consistently changed medications etc my sister's condition would not have deteriorated to the extend it has or in the time it has.\r\nIn addition she has had no less than six moves between Shottley Bridge and Durham. On one occasion she was transferred to Shottley Bridge where, shortly after arriving the staff there needed to send her back to Durham as she has an infection that they could not treat. On another occasion she required treatment at Durham and even though there was no bed for her Shottley Bridge transferred her to Durham at 5pm. She then spent NINE HOURS in casualty before being moved to a cardiac ward at 2. 30 in the morning. Why was she transferred when there was no bed? Surely sense dictated she should have stayed at Shottley Bridge until a bed was available.\r\nI think the treatment and constant movement of my sister is absolutely shocking and more so because of her age.

Living in France myself I didn't' know anything about the hospital.\nMy mother aged 75 was diagnosed in January 2014 with cancer of the ovaries, she saw a surgeon who decided with her to operate, it seems that when she did the tests for the anesthetic and heart, they found a problem. Her blood pressure was high and she had an enlarged heart.\nShe was told that she had to follow a treatment first for the heart and then they could operate.\nThey operated a few weeks after, perhaps too early as she had 2 heart failures during the operation and complications. I was contacted by my niece to come quickly as they had given her 24hours to live.\nI went as quickly as possible, when I arrived in the intensive care she was in a coma [artificial I think] it was touch and go for a few days but she finally woke up and here is where her nightmare started.\nWhen I first arrived a consultant came to see us, to explain what had happened, I was told that she might not pull through. the cancer had spread and they had had to operate on the bowl too, leaving her with a stoma (a bag which is attached to the intestines) also we were told that she was too weak to have chemo treatment. The consultant kept saying she would be kept comfortable..... What a joke! !\nI tried contacting her surgeon, to ask for more information, I needed to know different things e. g. , could she travel to France to live with me, was the cancer spreading, why they had left her with a stoma bag ..The surgeon refused to communicate with me even when my mother said it was possible to tell me!\nMy mother was sent home, and home care put in place, which it seem was very bad, my mother was rushed back into hospital by a doctor after the results of a blood test, she was completely dehydrated and malnutrition (she went from a size 22 to a size 12 in 2 months)\nI can't understand why the day nurses didn't realize this! ! My mother complained about the stoma bag which leaked everyday burning her skin raw! ! Also everything she ate was just going into the bag and her body was having no nourishments.\nSo was this stoma bag the best solution? ?\nI don't know what she weighed and I don't suppose the hospital new either, ! Because in the end for them she just became a condition and not a human! !\nBack in hospital different techniques where tried to nourish her but without success, here again I tried to contact the new doctor who she was under, and finally I can back to England to see my mum and talk to the doctor;\nWhen I arrived in the hospital and I saw what state she was in, they had done another little operation with a tube feeding her directly, she was crying with pain as nobody had come to change her stoma bag which had leaked out on her skin (it's like battery acid).\nShe was begging the nurses to come and do it .........it comes to something when you have to beg ....in the afternoon when finally someone came, I heard her screaming while they did it as it was so painful and raw.\nAlso she told me that nurses came and took her bags and creams to treat other patients.\nThis time I saw her doctor who came in on a round with some other consultants, he started to say \u201chere we have a cancer stage 4 which is spreading...........\u201d\nI will never forget the image of surprise on my mother's face; I made an excuse to go outside and asked to continue talking in another room (as patients hear when you talk just outside the door..as she had heard one saying she will never go home).\nHere I managed to ask the questions that were worrying me, but at the same time I was under shock to learn she was at a grade 4. They also discussed my mother's going home, but in the state and pain she was in I couldn't agree to this.\nUnfortunately I had to go back to France to work, my mother then caught a lung infections, which seems to be also a problem with the tubing they put in to feed her. She was taken into critical care where they drained of her lungs, we spoke every day, and she seemed to be breathing better, the day before she died she texted me asking me to do something quick as, they had put another patient in her room who had dementia this person was shouting and had chucked the commode full of wee and faeces on the bed!\nI managed to contact a friend of my mothers who went up to sort this out. My mother died the next day, I only know because when I wanted to phone her my stepfather answered the phone.\nI had not been contacted or notified by the hospital that she had died and what had finally killed her in May 2014.\n", "I am very sorry to hear how distressing your mother's care was at the hospital and I would like to send my condolences to your family.\r\nWe would really like to be able to look into this further so would appreciate if you could contact our Patient Experience Team to provide us with some more details (e-mail: PHT.PatExp@porthosp.nhs.uk)", "Over the past few years, my mother has been in and out of many hospitals due to her being blind, having heart problems and being diabetic and the care has been really good. \nShe was recently admitted to Victoria hospital in Kirkcaldy due to a suspected stroke and to be honest the care she has received has been disgusting. It was strongly emphasised to the nurses that she is blind, as well as being blind she had weakness down the left side of her body. However, she was still left alone for simple things that she struggles with, pouring herself a glass of water, cutting up her food and walking from the bed to the toilet. She was left unattended to walk to and from the toilet, and for some reason the floor was wet. When she went to make her return to her bed, she slipped and broke her hip. She was then left the entire day in her bed before she received an x-ray.\nOver the weekend, the nurses were trying to force her to use a bed pan whilst she was in far too much pain to move. She was later moved to another ward due to her hip and whilst some of the nurses have been really good, there are still some who obviously do not care as much as they should for the patients.\nOn one day we visited, she was covered in food, as the nurse who gave her lunch failed to help her bring her food close enough or eat. The nurse left my mother without even cutting up her food and so my mother was left with no choice but to eat like an animal with her hands. Another day a nurse was doing a blood pressure check and then left her without taking the cuff off her and then left my mother while she went away for her break. \nMy mother started physiotherapy and a few days later one of the nurses was trying to force my mother to move on her own from the bed to the chair, my mother struggles moving short distances by herself due to being blind but has found it even more difficult due to the stroke and having broken her hip. The nurse was adamant that my mother could do it by herself and kept trying to force my mother to do it. Thankfully, due to my mothers stubbornness on the subject, the nurse decided to offer a zimmer frame instead of the hoist. Later when confronted about it the nurse tried to deny what had been said. So not only did she not treat my mother in the incorrect manner, but she lied to us when we have our trust and faith left in her to look after my mother. \nMy father and I are very upset and disgusted about the way my mother has been treated and appalled by the fact the nurses are incapable to fill out the board of information about her properly. They failed to mention that she is blind and that she is dependant on help when it comes to her mobility. We are even more appalled that nurses often fail to look at her notes. The nurse we confronted tried to argue with us that my mother is not a stroke patient, when it had been confirmed the day before. \nIf this is what the NHS considers to be good care, then I find it disgusting because they are not showing or giving the care patients deserve. Patients should be allowed their dignity in hospital, especially when they are putting their entire trust onto strangers to look after them when they are helpless. My opinion is that this shows that some nurses are doing their job very poorly.", "Dear Kavanghpanda17\r\nI am very sorry to hear of your mother's experience, I dont think that anyone would think that this is an account of good care or the care that we aspire to deliver.\r\nI would like to have the opportunity to investigate this and if you would like to contact either my office or the Louise Ewing in patient liaison then we will arrange to investigate what happened and then to take appropriate action.\r\nDr Gordon Birnie\r\nAssociate medical Director, NHS Fife", "Dear Kavanaghpanda 17\r\nI have shared your post with the Director of Nursing for Acute Services who shares Dr Birnie's concern.

This is not a tangible science and the success to managing my emotional disability relies on having support from people who have come to know me well.

The only one I believed to be telling the truth was my care coordinator who had to implement the changes.  \nPersonal health budget has been mentioned but no one understands it well enough to establish if it can buy the core support that I need. It feels like a 'red herring' and I am not well enough to think about it until I feel more stable.\nIn the meantime I've experienced several dissociative episodes of self harm when I can't remember full details. This happens when I can't manage my anxiety/stress. I saw a member of the crisis team who could not help me. The home treatment team frighten me because it always involves strangers who do not understand me coming to my home and I find this intimidating.\nMy CPN has now left and I am in a seriously bad state with no plans in place that I can relate to. I have a complaint registered with the Trust but meanwhile I feel in a dangerous state of unstable emotions. I try to articulate to get resolution but to no avail. I am very afraid.\n", "I have been a patient with this service in excess of 12 years. Not one of those years has been good. My very first appointment was with a consultant who failed to show up, I sat anxiously in the waiting area for an hour. I asked the staff where the doctor was and what was happening. They did not know and they did not seem to  care. This consultant told me at the second and last appointment I had with her, that she had misplaced all my notes from 7 years of work with a psychiatrist in London. Those notes were never found.\nAnd it went downhill from there. A series of poor locums, infrequent appointments, no care team put in place, Finally there was a particular doctor. He stayed for a while. Except he cancelled some 70% of our appointments due to either illness or holidays. I felt like the other 30% was spent with him complaining of a health complaint. His lack of native level English and ability to listen to me, his patient was sadly reflected in the laughable letters sent to my GP after the few appointments he turned up at. My condition continued to deteriorate. I became more housebound, more anxious, more depressed, more suicidal.\nThen I had one doctor who was a brief ray of light. He held my hand and promised to help me manage my condition - to help me improve life. He listened, he asked the right questions, he started putting a care team in place, I was given a CPN, he was bright and so patient centred. Then he left to go to another trust. My CPN went off sick. I was left wondering where he was and when he would be back. I could get no answers from Kingswood. I had no CPN and no consultant. The CPN came back - for one appointment and then disappeared again. I have not seen him since. I made phone call after phone call to Kingswood, Where is my CPN or a new one? Who is my consultant now? No replies. I finally asked my GP to write a letter. \nShe got a response from someone at the trust who finally rang me. We will give you a new worker when she arrives in a few weeks. So this worker of some sort (I never did find out what) arrived to see me at home. I found her manner awkward - very passive-aggressive towards me. She did not ask the right questions or very many at all in fact, She made me anxious and uncomfortable. We made another appointment. She cancelled. She wrote to tell me she had set up a review with a doctor I did not know. I received the letter on a Saturday for an appointment the following Tuesday. Problem - I already had a meeting for that day. I rang Kingswood. Please let my worker know that I need to postpone this appointment - I have another on that day and the notice is just too short. I receive an accusatory voicemail message, \"You didn't show up at your appointment with the doctor\". It seems that once again - my message had not been passed on. \n\nThen the worker left another message cancelling our meeting set up in a local coffee shop. She said it was against protocol. Well in that case my CPN had been breaking with protocol for over a year I pointed out in a message back. I had enough. I had been left without any care for unacceptably long periods and  I feel like the Trust had failed me miserably. My illness was made worse by their care. I left 4 messages in the past 2 weeks for the person at the Trust that rang me previously to arrange the new worker.  In the a last attempt, I wanted to change my worker and try to get things set in place. No response, no response, no response.\nToday I get a letter from the worker. You don't try to engage with us. You did not go to the appointment. (I think  this is a load of rubbish and bile because I have kept the logs of every phone call made to Kingswood. ) We have no choice but to release you back to your GP.\nI feel like I have been abandoned yet again. It feels like inadequacies and lies are all they offer. How do I feel? Well I will not be calling the out of hours service even though I need them because my trust, hope and hard work to improve - all gone. Shattered. There are tears and hopelessness left.\n", "In my view this death was avoidable.  He had an achilles tendon injury. Full groin to toes plaster of paris back slab cast fitted. It was heavy and extremely immobilising. There was no risk assessment, no scan, no anti clot meds, no information about dvt, no instuction as to warning signs to look out for. Nothing! Forcible repositioning of his foot after over 5 weeks of being in the equinus position, he nearly passed out with the pain. An adjustable boot should have been used, to do it gradually. Doctor told me  no guidelines in place for outpatients . Not true. I have found DVT prevention policy which in my view  should have applied to my husband. His death certificate was issued on his 60th birthday.  I feel that this hospital has destroyed our lives.", "Thank you for sharing your experience with us, If you would like to contact me discuss it further please do.\r\nJames Allan\r\nPALS Manager\r\n01536 452070", "My elderly relative has been in Good Hope for some time and in that time I have seen her condition deteriorate so much so that she is a shadow of her former self. She entered hospital with a fracture and has left confused, incontinent and distressed. Her family are extremely close and will not stand by and ignore the poor treatment she experienced.\nI believe a formal complaint has been made by other family members BUT I want to make it clear the treatment and errors made by Good Hope.\n1. Ignoring concerns about the patients well being by those who know her best.\n2. Ignoring her needs as a patient with a visual disability - why oh why give a visually impaired patient tablets in a tiny pot she can't see?\n3. How do you know she has taken the medication which could quite easily be dropped on the floor?\n4. Leaving her covered in food because she can't see to eat so that it dries on her clothes?\n5. Having no visual indication to ward staff that she is visually impaired!\n6. Discharge information in a font that she can't read.\n7. Discharge information that was factually incorrect and a social worker who laughed when the mistakes were pointed out.\n8. Misinformation to the nursing home.\nThe lady in question is valued by so many people, friends and family and she deserves better! Some staff when I visited were exceptionally kind but they were rather the exception. Too many staff were dismissive of her needs regarding her as a dementia patient rather than someone with poor sight.\nIt's not good enough. She is lucky in that her family are intelligent and assertive enough to speak out when things are not right. However what happens to those people without relatives or friends?\nThe family have photographs to support all their assertions and I myself have witnessed their lack of compassion.

The concerns relate to numerous failings from admission to discharge. The continuity of care in this locality is severely lacking. We have complained via pals and received a courtesy contact with no further follow up. However the issues require further investigation if this organisation is to implement its new quality improvement plan and listen to its patients and their carers.\nMy grandfather has not been treated with dignity and has received both poor care and to my mind possible clinical negligence.\nHe was admitted for a cardiac condition and discharged to home without any investigation of social circumstances, with a chest infection - he is 90, in poor health and was carer for his wife of 64 years with dementia. Because of the poor discharge circumstances this has meant my grandmother is now in a home. My grandfather was then told by a physician at a routine out-patient appointment, which he waited over 2 hours to be seen, that he was discharged from respiratory care. He has COPD . He was spoken to in a manner that in our opinion fails equality and diversity laws and almost amounts to blatant age discrimination. He was shown no compassion about his recent experience and coming to terms with his wife now living in a home. Despite sharing this information with the physician he was asked rudely why he wasn't in a home. This was said twice.\nSince then we have had numerous needs to call out for an untreated chest infection until a couple of weeks ago. He was finally readmitted via the GP but still had to wait in A&E over 4 hours to be admitted. He is now on home oxygen and has been diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis in addition to COPD - less than a month from the outpatient appointment review. As I write this he may have been readmitted or discharged following review by the community matron who arranged for x-rays and tests querying PE. Whilst an inpatient over the Summer he was informed of his terminal condition on his own with no information other than a gold standards framework leaflet. The family were not informed despite asking staff daily.\nThe discharge meeting was arranged without the family being involved other than a phone call giving 15 minutes notice. My grandfather had not told us about his condition. I found the leaflet yesterday and we learned the horror of his latest experience. He has had no specific support regarding end of life care since being told this news because of the apparent complete lack of care from the organisation.\nWe look forward to your response from a family who have now got first hand experience of the failings of the health and social care system of this locality after providing full time care for 4 months.", "Hello,\r\nWe wanted to let you know that your story got our Healthwatch Chair thinking about what would need to change in the system for your experience to have been different. He has written a blog on this which you might find interesting - you can read it by visiting https://joehwnotts.wordpress.com/", "mum was a fit outgoing beautiful funny, irish lady of 70 years. she had no symptoms until being diagnosed with bowel cancer in march 2012. she was given keyhole surgery 1 week later. she had no stoma and seemed to recover fine, the surgeon said the surgery went very well. 2 days later she was in a great amount of pain, and was being sick. she was taken for surgery where they had to open her up completely and clean her out, she had developed peritonitus, and then sepsis from the surgery. she was in surgery 7 hours. the registrar said it was the worst case he had ever seen, even with faeces in her body cavity. we were there all night, the surgeon said it was caused by either the stitches coming undone on her bowel or she could have been punctured during the original surgery.\nwe were told she would die that night, it was devastating for us, she was put into a coma, and was on life support for 3 weeks! !\nshe came out of this, she was given a stoma to save her life in the second op she had, it was inverted, and the bags just kept flying off, and she would be covered. she came out of intensive critical care and was transferred to h d unit. she was then transferred to stepping stones for rehab, as she couldn't move when she came out of the coma, she couldn't even scratch her nose. she had lost over 5 stones in weight.\nhowever, she learned to walk again. went back up to 9 stone and was totally independent again after fighting this terrible battle with sepsis.\nwhen we saw the surgeon again, mum told them that they had taken her life away from her, the surgeon said they were very sorry! !\nafter 5 months in hospital in sept 2012, she began having pain. the surgeon assured her it was only scar tissue, and said she was too weak for chemotherapy after the sepsis anyway.\nshe had a scan on her liver with a different doctor, in the September, for a different reason, and was told she had cancer. we went to see mums gp, who got the scan results up and said yes you still have cancer, go enjoy what time you have left, this was a terrible bow to us. \nthe gp made us an appointment with the surgeon, who again promised us that it was not the cancer, but scar tissue, I asked if he was an oncologist as we want to see one, but the surgeon said there would have to be something untoward before an oncologist would see us anyway? ? ?\nthree weeks before Christmas 2012 mum had another scan, and told us sorry but there was cancer there and mum could see an oncologist in the jan 2013, but it would only be for palliative chemotherapy! ! !\nI asked the surgeon why bring her through all that ordeal saving her from the sepsis, to let her die slowly like this, the reply was, its human nature to try and save! ! \nafter Christmas in jan 2013 mum began chemo, I went with her every week until june, when the oncologist said she needed a rest from it.  We were told it had worked and she only had a small growth left in her groin, it had gone in the liver and other areas, which they said was good news. \nmum felt ok for a month or so, then the terrible pain started, I had to call an ambulance on at least 3 occasions, and explain to doctors, nurses, and ambulance drivers what she had been through. the put her on a trolley as a and e was so busy for at least 5 hours then onto a surgical ward.\nThe surgeon there did a scan and said it might be gall stones! ! she returned home again with strong pain relief, the gp asked our local hospice if they could see her for pain relief, which they did, but she was made to feel as if she was a hypochondriac, as the original surgeon said it was not the cancer! !\nshe was eventually taken in to the hospice in august 2013, to sort out pain relief. \nwhile there one of their doctors asked for mums oncologist to see her. I took her from the hospice in a wheel chair as by now she was very weak.\nwe waited 4 hours in that waiting room. the oncologist was running late, and mum wasn't down to see one of the juniors! ! by the end of the 4 hours, the nurses had to move us into a private waiting area as mum was rolling around and crying in pain. this was torture to see.... as her medication had worn off. the nurse fetched mums oncologist who couldn't believe how ill she had become in just 2 months. The oncologist couldn't tell me if it was the cancer as there were no scans to compare it to. I said yes, she was in a and e 3 weeks before and the doctor there did a scan, he thought she had gall stones. thankfully I remembered that doctors name, the oncologist went to check on the computer and came back quite visibly shocked.   The oncologist held mums hand and said im sorry, the tumours are now on your spine and groin and all around, all I can do for you now is radio therapy to try to get rid of the pain in your back. we took mum for the radio therapy. it did help with that pain in her back.\nshe died in October 2013. I feel we lost her twice, and my god didn't she suffer, I hope the n h s can learn from this awful story, because throughout everything she went through, my mum was always smiling, cheerful and wasn't afraid of dying, I will never get over her loss or her suffering", "We have had few visits and contacts with doctors but on a Friday about 4 pm there appears to be a rush to the wards. Doctors who have never examined or spoken to the patient feel they have the right to discuss their cases which are quite advanced illnesses and then suggest DNAR with them. This has happened on both Fridays that he has been at the hospital. \nIt would seem that doctors are sent out to get as many as possible just before the weekend as the care on the weekend is even worse than during the week and they are busy. So this being the implication why not tell everyone they are dying and why not try a DNAR? Really we have been so distressed by this as we have known the patient for 60 years as a father and he has a wife of more than 60 years. \nDo older patients have to say they want to die? Why can't clinicians make a decision if a patient is very sick and slips slowly away in the ward?\nSome patients believe still in the will of God and such hard decisions contradict their faith at this vital time. I would interested to know if others have seen this Friday Phenomenon.", "I was told I needed a large kidney stone removed, otherwise it will cause serious damage to my kidney. I had the operation only to be told casually by a nurse, not the doctor, that there was no kidney stone. They sent me home with a severe kidney infection, which required an out of hours visit to the doctor.\r\nI wrote a letter asking for a copy of my x-ray and scan only to be told on an outpatient appointment, that the system was down and I could not view the x-ray and scan. I was also told that it was not possible for me to have a copy of my scan and x-ray, but I have it on good authority that it is possible to get copies of x-rays and scans.\r\nA poor experience.", "In my opinion the hospital urgently needs to be brought up to date. There are issues with areas that have no nurse call system in place. There is poor communication between medical and nursing staff and the morale/attitude of staff is terrible. All of which, as a health care professional viewing the hospital from the perspective of a relative of a patient, worries me a lot. The A&E staff and ENT doctors who saw my partner were fantastic but at ward level there seem to be serious failings (SAU).\nEg. Patient was left without IV paracetamol for 6 hours despite paracetamol being written up for 4 hours resulting in a raging pyrexia. The nurse explained that the doctor had not asked her to give iv paracetamol but it was clearly communicated in her notes.\nPatient was admitted with throat issues and struggles to speak. There is no nurse call system in place and was left for too long without being able to contact the staff behind curtains. If there was a problem she would be unable to shout for help. Why is there no nurse call system on SAU?\nPatient is diabetic and was on sliding scale. No attempt was made to silence the pump alarms or check the problem for nearly an hour after they started. The alarm was due to the insulin being all gone so patient received no insulin for almost an hour.", "My 82 year old father was admitted to the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, in October 2013 and he was very quickly diagnosed with end-stage stomach cancer. It was suggested that he be transferred to an NHS Continuing Care facility. Ellen's Glen hospital was highly recommended to us by a friend (and NHS worker) and so we were delighted when the consultant confirmed that a bed had been found for my father there. Up until this point, we as a family, had no idea of what services a Continuing Care Facility offered, we soon found out a high proportion of patients go there to die, which would mean that Continuing Care was in fact a hospice facility. Not so (and more of this later).\nOn transfer to Ellen's Glen, my father, although suffering from early-stage vascular dementia, was conscious, able to communicate, drinking lots and eating little and his pain was being managed by oral painkillers. His mobility was poor, he was unsteady on his feet and was deemed a high risk for falls. Within a few days it became clear to me (his daughter), that his condition was worsening, he was becoming weaker and experiencing more pain. On a number of occasions I spoke to staff members to highlight my concerns and asked for his condition to be reassessed, with specific regard to pain management and the issue of him falling out of bed when trying to use the bathroom.\nFamily members visited my father at different times every day and we all soon noticed a number of issues regarding staffing levels.\nThe staffing levels were clearly too low as many of the patients had complex conditions requiring intensive nursing care. Patient's buzzers were constantly ringing, with some patients also continually calling for help. Lots of changes of staff \u2013 which is very confusing and distressing for someone suffering from dementia. Staff sickness levels seemed to be high, meaning that bank and agency staff were continually being called in to cover. \nExactly a week before my father died, my family and I visited him. We found him in a distressed state, clearly in a lot of pain, and he had tried to get out of bed to use the bathroom. We called a nurse and asked for immediate pain relief. This took some time to organise. We expressed our concerns regarding my father's pain relief and lack of pain management and the nurse confirmed that they were aware that my father was hiding his oral pain relief \u201cas he didn't want to take it\u201d. Given that my father was confused, dehydrated and suffering from dementia, we felt that the staff should have been more responsive and we requested that a syringe driver be set up for him as his pain was clearly not being managed. The nurse said that wouldn't be possible, or appropriate and would start with injecting small amounts of pain relief. We spent some time with staff that evening, outlining our concerns, emphasising that my father was too weak to use a normal cup, and that he needed help and encouragement to drink. We were given reassurances that staff would monitor my father more closely and make sure his pain relief was administered by injection.\nThe next morning my brother and I visited early. What we saw will haunt us for ever. We found my father in an even more distressed stated, half undressed, in soiled underwear, hanging off the bed, shouting for help. There were several large ceramic mugs of tea and cups of water on his side table, which he was too weak to lift to drink.\nWe demanded to see a senior member of staff. The staff member apologised and said, \u201c I am sorry that you saw your father like that\u201d. We related the events and discussions of the previous day.  The staff member was visibly shaken and upset. They returned to speak to me in my father's room, and had been crying, it was obvious. In the meantime staff come and go, cleaning the room, cleaning my father and STILL we wait for pain relief. What is taking SO long? The staff who are cleaning my father are on the verge of tears, one says \u201cI am so sorry\u201d. They look ashamed and embarrassed.\nAnother staff member returns alone to reassure us. They have been wonderful, compassionate and caring in all my dealings with them. Now they look humiliated. Another staff member who is choking back tears.\nIt becomes clear to us over this period that the home was originally resourced based on simple nursing care needs for residents but this home now has people like my father with very complex palliative care needs. The home simply cannot cope with the demands now being placed on it.\nMy father finally received a syringe driver on the Friday, only to be told that there was no Doctor on duty at the weekend \u2013 only an on-call locum doctor who could be called in emergencies.\nWe asked medical staff to ensure that the drug levels would be adequate to sedate my father and ensure he would be pain-free. However, it quickly became clear that this wasn't the case. He was experiencing break through pain every 1-2hrs. This meant that our family had to stay with my father over the whole weekend to ensure that we could get staff to respond as soon as his pain broke through. It was a very stressful weekend as my father still wasn't pain free and we muddled through as best we could. At no point did any staff member offer to contact the on-call doctor to adjust the meds in his syringe driver. This was eventually done on the Monday when the doctor was back on duty.\nOver that particular weekend, 4 patients died at Ellen's Glen. One of which I witnessed coughing, and choking and his buzzer went unanswered. We found another patient collapsed just outside their room. She had been calling for help and no one came. I had to help one until my brothers could locate a member of staff. This took some time. We were so concerned about patient safety at this point that I took the decision to contact a minister in Scottish Government.  I spoke to their office and explained that due to the \u201cdangerously low staffing levels\u201d we felt that patient care was being severely compromised and that someone needed to intervene. We were informed that we should go through the relevant NHS channels to highlight our complaint.\nI would like to make it clear that without exception, every member of staff who came into contact with my father, was polite, caring, compassionate and clearly experienced in palliative nursing care. They all expressed the wish that \u201cthey could do more\u201d. However, the staffing levels at Ellen's Glen do not allow for the appropriate end of life care to be given. There just isn't enough staff or time to tend to the complex needs of so many patients. \nWe expected a dignified and pain-free end of life experience for my father.\nIndeed, that very statement can be found in the government guideline: Living and Dying Well: \u201c our aim is to ensure the delivery of high quality palliative care to everyone in Scotland on the basis of clinical need not diagnosis, and according to established principles of equity and personal dignity\u201d.\nWe only get to say goodbye once to a loved one and sadly the last words my father spoke, in pain and distress were: \u201chelp me, please someone help me, I'm dying\u201d.\nI will never be able to erase that horrendously, traumatic memory.\nThe facts speak for themselves, patient safety, human rights and dignity are being compromised due to inappropriate staffing levels. This is not just my opinion. May I direct you to the RCN report: Guidance on Safe Nurse Staffing Levels in the UK, where it states:\n\"in the current financial context there is a real danger that health care providers will look to reduce staffing as a means of achieving short-term savings - but without consideration of the long-term costs or risk to patient care. Fiscally-led changes to care delivery need to be risk assessed for the potential impact on staffing and patient care\".\nIf anyone within the NHS, Scottish Patient Safety, Health Improvement Scotland, Royal College of Nursing or any other official body would like to speak to me further, I would welcome the opportunity to discuss our experiences to ensure that no one else is exposed to needless suffering.

At times this has been when I have been very unwell and vulnerable. \nAs I work for the NHS myself, I understand the pressures and financial shortcomings better than most patients. I find it hard to accept that this is an excuse for negligence, insensitivity and appallingly poor practices. I feel I have repeatedly been the victim of neglect and a lack of understanding or care at times when my safety was already compromised by my illness. \nExamples include not being contacted when requesting urgent help, being spoken to insensitively or ignored when in visible distress, and worst of all my suicidal feelings bring dismissed. On that occasion almost cost me my life. \nAll these experiences mean I have no confidence in this trust, would not seek their services when unwell and find it even harder to ask for help when I am vulnerable. \nI have also spent large sums of money on private mental health services. I resent having to do this as it has been a struggle and think as I hold down a full time job despite my problems and therefore pay for my care in taxes I don t see why I should pay again. \nThe conduct of some employees of this trust make me ashamed to be associated with the NHS.

I felt very lethargic and down. Was given beta blockers and sent home. \nNext day, another ride in ambulance to Grantham. Again kept in, same problems. Getting worse this time, given some red liquid in a small bottle with a spray and told to take two puffs when I had chest pain again. I asked two puffs like an inhaler and the Matron said yes. Two days later I had a chest pain and inhaled only one puff which nearly killed me by taking my breath away. My carer drove straight to Grantham hospital kept in again.

I had initial assessments inc scan etc. Told was on waiting list to go to Leicester hospital for a op to look at my heart veins\nMy condition was getting worse\nI looked on Internet and found out I was being overdosed with Fentynl so I roped the patch off and told the Doctor when he came round what I had found out. He agreed and reduced the patch back to its original strength.

I found this to be untrue. \nI was admitted to Good Hope Hospital maternity unit one evening in May 2013, suffering from contractions. I explained that I had a previous C Section and had a feeling that my scar may have ruptured slightly, so the pain I was feeling wasn't being fully picked up by the monitor. On doing an internal examination told I was 2 cm dilated and yet was sent home on the Tuesday.\nI was later re-admitted with same problem the same evening, after speaking to my antenatal consultant and requesting an elective c section scheduled for early June (a few days before my due date). This wasn't even taken into consideration by staff on ward! \nI told the staff I felt like I needed to empty my bowels, which after pregnancy laxatives I was able to do and yet still had feeling I needed to go requested internal and it never happened was sent home yet again. \nIn the very early hours of that Friday I was driven in absolute agony by my mother back to GHH, where it was discovered during an emergency c section that my daughter had not only caused my previous scar to rupture, but she also caused a uterine rupture (my bladder burst) which was almost missed!\nAfter coming around I was told that they thought I had a blood clot in left leg and while waiting to go for a scan, was told quite coldly by a consultant that I really should have been sterilized as another pregnancy could kill me! And then they left. Later on, I was fairly upset and cried. To which, a nurse closed the curtain on me so as not to upset other patients. I had to have a catheter for almost fortnight, as well as an x-ray to see if my bladder had healed. Thankfully it has. \nI had numerous gynaecology appointments cancelled, including one while I was sat in the waiting room. After my last appointment, I found out I will have to be sterilized, but due to damage done and the fact my bladder is fused to my womb I have to have A non surgical procedure done called an ESSURE sterilisation at the Women's hospital in Birmingham city centre.

July came and went and I heard nothing so complained to my consultant in August and informed them I would taking legal action regarding Medical Negligence. They assured me I'd hear something within a few weeks, as I need the paper work so can put a claim forward. It is now October and I've still heard nothing.

I was referred to the CMHT, which filled me with hope of finally having multiple mental health problems treated, as I had reached the end of my rope and was actively suicidal.\nThe CMHT was a mess from the start. Ignoring the first referral until nudged by the GP (their excuse being that they had relocated to an office on the other side of the borough, highly obstructive to patients from north Lewisham seeing them), and eventually having me initially seen by a nurse who was grossly dismissive of problems (\"that doesn't sound like an eating disorder\", a sloppy conclusion reached when he decided to butt in partway through my explanation of what was happening to me) and told me I would not be seen by the CMHT but instead referred to Mind.\nOver a month later, I had heard from no one. The GP did not understand what had happened. My workplace occupational health eventually nudged the CMHT as my situation had worsened during their silence, causing me to lose a month of work and take a hit to my income. The CMHT had changed their mind and wanted to see me again, fulfilling my earlier request to be assessed by a psychiatrist.\nThe psychiatrist was fine - personable and reassuring, and largely understanding. He recognised that as I had been actively suicidal between visits that I was at high risk and needed to be placed on medication. I was told I could pick up a prescription from my GP that day. For a week, I visited and called the GP, whose receptionists and doctors were confused and had no record of this prescription being sent through. My condition worsened. I was suicidal, let down, and now sure that the very act of seeking help was a negative trigger that had to be avoided.\nWhen I complained to PALS and asked them to cancel a later CMHT appointment (I saw no use as this appointment was intended to discuss my experience with the medication I never received), I was discharged from the CMHT and left stranded. The explanation was nightmarish: the prescription for a suicidal patient had simply sat in their office for a fortnight before being sent.\nI received an apology, but frankly the damage has been done and that the apology came with a discharge letter was a slap in the face at my lowest point. Two months later, I am depressed, anxious, and no longer want to be alive. Disordered eating and poor self esteem is destroying my social life and all of the above is conspiring to ruin my career. The toll it is taking on my body is stressful and upsetting, and to compound matters I have been the victim of violent crime and despite suffering nightmares, fear and anxiety following the incident, cannot seek help because I am equally as afraid of the mental healthcare this borough provides.\nI believe treatment is vital for anyone suffering with mental health issues, and I would always urge others to seek help and seek it forcefully, remaining unforgiving of failure and demanding an adequate and timely response to their problem. My mistake was in being too forgiving and too passive (though when passivity is a hallmark of depression it seems odd for professionals to take advantage of this as an excuse to be lax), and I believe that this mistake will ultimately be fatal.

I would apologise for not answering here but I had hoped we could address the issues at the meeting.\r\nIn specific answer to your questions, the visits I mentioned are unannounced. There are two tiers of inspection one from an NHS Lothian Team completely independent from the Community Health Partnership and these happen approximately every 18 months. Then an internal team which has external people I.e. infection control, estates and domestics on it including a patient representative not from the actual inpatient area enables us to audit all areas on a yearly basis.\r\nThe audits are twofold on something we call a PQI or Patient Quality Indicators audit which mirrors the Health Environment Inspectorate inspections and Older People in Acute Care which is an audit developed nationally about the experience factors. We have also implemented this as, whilst Ellen's Glen is not an acute hospital, the experience factors are just as important in a more downstream facility.\r\nAll of these audits are unannounced. There would be no point in doing them announced as we would then not learn about improvements required. Each area then has an action plan developed around the areas of improvement and we then work to implement them.\r\nEllen's Glen is subject to National Health Environment Inspections and was added to the inspection regime when community hospitals were added.\r\nDocumentation on these visits is available and I would be happy to share it with you at the meeting.\r\nSecondly the \u00a3181,000 is being focussed on the three frail elderly wards to firstly help reduce variation I.e. improve skill mix of staff. However we do know this is not the full answer to challenges we have. NHS Lothian is introducing e rostering and safe care which will commence being rolled out from April 2015 and this will enable us to measure patient acuity and set staffing levels more scientifically than is currently the case. We run the national workforce planning tools yearly (this is mandatory from the Government). Mental health wards were done in August and the Frail Elderly wards commenced on the 6th October.\r\nFinally, as you will be aware a meeting has been set up with the Chief Nurse for Edinburgh CHP, the Clinical Nurse Manager for IPCC and a Chief Nurse from the Acute Division to meet with you and your brothers on the 14th November.\r\nI trust and hope that meeting will go a long way to answering your questions in more detail.\r\nYours sincerely,\r\nStuart Wilson", "I live in Bournemouth. 2 years ago I went for a routine smear test the nurse inserted the speculum and opened it till I screamed in agony.  she then continued to open it more whilst I was still screaming she left me on the couch going to her work station I do not know how long she was gone but I continued to scream I was paralysed and terrified I did not know how long this torture would continue. when she finally returned and removed the speculum I was so traumatised I could not speak. on leaving the surgery all the reception staff had grins on their faces. finally after more than 2 months I contacted the practice manager who ignored my suffering I contacted p. a. ls and n. h. s England finally the police who informed me that they know this sort of thing happens but as I had agreed to have a smear test they was nothing they could do.

With deep regret I have to say the two severe traumatic experiences that have devastated my life and a minor incident by comparison has negated the goodwill I have felt.\nAt 61 years I have suffered scoliosis all my life but with good posture and the right exercise I have lived my life to the full. However in the last few years I have suffered abdominal and lower back pain. After ruling out any abdominal problems I was referred to a consultant rheumatologist at Christchurch outpatients in Bournemouth.\nAs soon as I had met this consultant I had a bad feeling. They asked me to lay on the couch raise both my legs straight about 2-3 feet up, then slowly lower my legs keeping them straight. I was totally unassisted, I felt my back arching and burning and screamed \"my back my back\" the consultant seemingly shouted at me in what I found to be a very aggressive way to hold my position. I then again screamed \"my back my back.\" My back then went into spasm I was shaking and thought I was having some sort of fit.\nThis is called a double leg lift which I have recently found out it is not recommended for even the young and fit and very dangerous for people with scoliosis and lower back problems. The consultant was 4 feet to my right shoulder and the nurse was behind me. At no time did the consultant come to my aid to check for any damage.\nI just wanted to get out of that surgery as I was in shock. I complained to my GP about this incident and cancelled all appointments with this rheumatologist.\nHowever I needed to be referred to another specialist because, not only did I have the original problem, I was also suffering from the additional pain caused by this person.\nI went one more time just to close my treatment with this rheumatologist.\nWhen I arrived they looked embarrassed and red faced, demanding to know why I had cancelled all my appointments. I replied there were many reasons why I had cancelled. I then told them my problems had resolved just to get them off my back. However just before leaving I asked them if they realised they'd damaged my back the last time I was there which they seemed to acknowledge. \nI wrote to PALs but was expecting the usual excuses and got them. I contacted the GMC. They looked into my complaint, then replied according to our consultant the double leg lift was an appropriate exercise. I could not believe this so asked under FOI what qualifications had this consultant to make such a decision on the use of the double leg lift.\nIn my particular case, two weeks later I received a reply on why they should not release this info but I could appeal which I have. I was also informed if this appeal failed I could appeal again. This is pen pushing at its' worst.", "After 5 misdiagnoses from my mother's GP surgery, my mother finally collapsed at home and was taken to hospital. On the second day at hospital she was diagnosed with terminal cancer. At the time we were told that an oncologist or consultant would see us as a family. This never happened. Two days in and my mother was taken to the geriatric ward, Wheal Agar. \nWheal Agar is a dark, hot ward in the bowels of the building, lacking in natural light. As we entered we heard the cries of dying people, the singing of the nurses and the smell of human excrement. This sensory experience did not change for the four days my mother was alive here. My sister said it reminded her of a third world hospital ward. \nSometimes it took ages to enter as when you pressed the buzzer, staff didn't come. I noticed other visitors helping each other out instead. We witnessed a shocking lack of dignity for my mother and other patients. We saw different nurses every day. Some didn't know how to move the bed, or change the drip, which resulted in mother's blood shooting out onto the grimy floor. Food was left on my mother's face after a small meal. She developed ulcers on her tongue and mouth but nobody seemed to notice. I don't believe my mother was washed until the morning of her death. I cleaned her limbs and face regularly. \nThe young doctor in charge of the ward flared red in the neck and started to cry when we asked why nothing was being done to relieve mother's pain and suffering. This astonished me and made me think that this doctor must have been very inexperienced. Thereafter, mother received some pain relief, but it seemed that an action plan of palliative care had not even been thought about. On one occasion, mother was moved into a different room without our knowledge. We found out on arrival. Clearly her level of distress was upsetting the other patients. \nA senior nurse was sent in by the young doctor in charge to discuss our request of taking mother home to die, which then descended into what we found to be an unprofessional argument. This was the first time we had even seen this senior nurse, despite the fact that we visited every day. At no point during the whole experience did a doctor, consultant or nurse find us to speak to us about mother. We had to seek them out for information or to inform them of mother's or even other patient's distress. We did not get the opportunity to remove mother from this ghastly place, she died here on the sixth morning at hospital. The senior nurse was seemingly triumphant in telling me and almost tried to physically stop me from seeing my own mother, but I already knew and I went in. \nI am horrified that my mother went through this. I was expecting a programme of medical care but this was entirely absent. I have discussed what happened with my GP who has recommended I complain formally, but it is clear that the current system is in favour of the medical profession not the patient or family aggrieved. \nThis ward was closed in 2012 but clearly reopened again and is running the same as usual. Even though I am Cornish and have an occupation here, this heartbreaking and grotesque experience had led me to think about leaving the county completely.", "Dear Southbank\r\nI received your posting today following your experiences in the Rheumatology department. I am sorry to note that you have had a poor experience in the clinic and I have already spoken to PALs who you mentioned you had been in contact with. Please know that we have taken your feedback very seriously and as part of my immediate investigation I also noted you mentioned that you had already raised a complaint and received a response. It is sad to hear that you were unhappy with the result of your PALs response and that of the GMC. As I do not have that depth of clinical knowledge I am unable to comment, but understand from you that you are pursuing the appeals process.\r\nSadly I think I have also responded to a previous complaint from you, so it is even more disappointing to note that we have still not got things right for you. Because of this, I have spoken with our Clinical Director and we want to make every effort to ensure we do the right thing for every patient every time. We do not want to be seen as \u201cpen pushing\u201d, especially as our staff are dedicated and committed to doing the best for all of our patients. I appreciate it can be hard when you do not receive the response you may have hoped for and really hope you are now feeling much better.\r\nNoting that you have cancelled all your future appointments, we do not want your care to be affected because of this event. Please do contact your GP, who may possibly be able to refer you to another Trust for your continued care, if you still do not want to come back to us. However, please know that you are welcome in the event you do return.\r\nPlease contact us again if we can be of any further assistance either by calling PALs on 01202 704886 or emailing them PALS@rbch.nhs.uk.\r\nKind regards\r\nSue", "We are very concerned to read your story about your mother's last days in Wheal Agar ward. We would be grateful for an opportunity to meet you, hear your concerns directly and understand more about your experience.\r\nMy name is Lana-Lee Jackson, Patient Experience Manager at Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust and you can email me at: pals.service@rcht.cornwall.nhs.uk"]}}; }
