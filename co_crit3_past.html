staff and in the attitude of nurses. My husband was admitted to the hospital in June 2008, arriving at A&E by ambulance called by our GP. It was 5 hours before he saw a doctor, during which time his condition was deteriorating.  He spent 23 hours in the Acute Admissions Unit (where the level of nursing care was minimal - e.g. one dose of drugs was 'forgotten'.  When I became very anxious and complained strongly to the Bed Manager, 2 doctors arrived at his bed very quickly and the consultant arrived within 10 minutes.  Do you have to complain to get attention in this hospital?  What would happen if the patient is alone? A truly dreadful experience in A&E, and little better on Ward 10.", "\nMy eldery Father came to KGH via ambulance last night to Ix a sudden severe pain in his arthritic hip?subluxating. \n\nThe duty doctor spoke to my father in a high pitched baby voice as though he was a deaf and confused young child. She also directed all explanations away from him and his next of kin to me!\n\nMy parents and I were appalled at this patronising treatment but my father did not wish me to say anything at the time. \n\nI am extremely angry that this has happened to my elderly, forgetful but extremely dignified father. \n\nI am also very concerned that, without any suggestion from the hospital, he now needs stronger painkillers and a physio referral, which, thankfully I am able to organise. However, without me he would have not been aware that he could receive this and tried to struggle on alone.\n\nAll staff to show humanity and respect to people and appropriate medication on discharge.", "My 11 year old son was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease but not offered any particular treatment for a while. Then he was suddenly prescribed 60 milligrams of prednisolone (steroids) and kept on this high dose for a whole month. This was just after I dared to seek a second opinion at another hospital.\r\nI have since been told that such a dose is high even for an adult. The reason given was a very slight weight loss.\r\nLater, as he suffered coming off this high dose, we were told on the phone to put him on immuno-suppressants. This is the treatment my young son suffered at the hands of the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford.", "My elderly but extremely active (mentally & phisically) father spent much of the last days of his life in the Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield. Communication was poor at every level so even though we asked it seemed that no one really knew what his treatment was. Where was his designated nurse or a doctor willing to explain? He was finally discharged with two infected biopsy sites despite telling the staff  - and  it turned out to be MRSA. So he was unwell when returned home and had to rely on my mother and GP services to pick up the pieces - he died a couple of weeks later. This is the first time we have felt such a lack of care - ageism possibly creeping in. He did tell me that one of the staff had on one occasion called him \"a stupid old man\". I am an ex nurse and I know how much better his experience could have been despite the pressures on the NHS.", "I have seen a neurologist at this hospital on a number of occasions for head pain and numbness of the mouth. He has done a brain MRI over 2 years ago, which was non conclusive and has done nothing ever since. While the pain gets worse and the numbness is constant, he just sits there and says he doesn't know what it is and that he's only a little old doctor. He even called himself stupid, which is the only intelligent thing I have heard him say.", "I broke my right ankle 18 months ago. I could not walk for 8 months and went to painful physiotherapy at great unnecessary cost to the NHS, as I also needed transport and painkillers and sleeping pills. The senior consultant at St Mary's Paddington failed to recognise the symptoms. A letter was sent to my GP discharging me, when I still had pain. I had regional transient or migrant osteoporosis. 4 months ago I broke my left ankle, and the same consultant and his registrars didn't even bother to look at my foot. Again, a letter was sent saying the fracture had healed and I wasn't in pain, again that wasn't true. I went to A&E and had another x ray and was told it hadn't healed. I then went back and made another appointment in such pain.\r\nThe registrar recognised I was in pain but said the fracture had healed and went to my consultant to see where to direct me.\r\nHe flicked through my notes asked me if I had a drinking problem (I haven't) asked what was in my diet coke and told me to go.\r\nI am a pensioner on pension credits. I asked my doctor to recommend somebody privately. I had X rays that showed the fracture hadn't healed and a MRI scan that showed the abnormality of my foot which was easy to see, if either the registrar or consultant bothered to look.\r\nI saw many cases on Google. I put the cost on a credit card and borrowed money and want the money back. I was amazed to learn that if you complain to a hospital you only get an apology. I have now formally asked for it. Also I want all physiotherapists, registrars and consultants to be aware of the condition, so nobody suffers like I have. With complete rest this condition gets healed and I had an effusion by a good rheumatologist. The symptoms are abnormality of the foot and acute pain.", "On Sunday 30th November 2008 I visited A & E as I had been awake all night with pains in my left shoulder and neck. I was checked out for heart problems and was told that my heart was ok and my other organs appeared to be in good order. During that day my left arm became immovable and the pain was intense.I told the doctor and he said that it was a trapped nerve. I managed to get home at about 5pm (I arrived at the A & E at approximately 7.30 that morning) I did have to wait for the results of blood tests. At about 8pm my right arm became painful and immovable. My wife took me back to the A & E. after waiting several hours I was seen by a young doctor. She gave me one Codine tablet, some muscle relaxants and a sheet of execises for my shoulders. The next day my leg became very difficult to move and to walk wih. Eventually my GP referred ne to the Stroke Clinic at Aintree Hospitals. I was given an MRI scan and told that I had an 'abnormality on my spinal cord'. I was immediately hospitalised. The eventual diagnosies was that I had contracted 'acute transverse myelitus'. This is an uncommon condition which, in my case due to the site of the inflammation was potentially life threatening.\r\n\r\nI appreciate the the disease I have is uncommon, but to have both arms disfunctional within a short space of time I think should have resulted more than the treatment that I was given. I don't know if I will recover the use of my left arm (it is not very useful at present). I do think that the presenting symptoms should have been beeter investigated.\r\n", "I am a patient who suffers from severe and chronic Crohn's Disease. I was rushed into hospital severely malnourished, deficient and anaemic with an acute flare up of the disease. Although I very much respected and liked my doctors, the nurses were **appalling** . The mentality was that of teachers chastising naughty children. I was told off because my veins would not tolerate a cannula for more than 24 hours and became painful (as if this is my fault!!) and my treatment was delayed because apparently there were no doctors to resite it (a hospital with no doctors?). I had the same dirty, sweaty pillowcase for over a week and it was wet due to my frequent night sweats. My friend had to change it. My bed was covered in blood, my friend changed it. I was given an enema so I could have a sigmoidoscopy, was told it was not painful or uncomfortable and would only cause me to clear my bowel. I ended up laid on the floor of the toilet, pulling the emergency cord, in far more pain than even childbirth, it was as if someone was twisting my bowel repeatedly and I seriously thought I would die. (I am not a wimp, I had a child 7lb 3oz without any drugs and I didn't object despite my labour lasting 24 hrs). I was brought food that I could not eat due to my illness. I was forced to sit in a chair and told off when I went back to my bed and laid down, but it was so painful and I was dizzy and nauseous to boot, not the sort of condition you really want to sit in a chair for a long time. I asked for a sick bowl due to extreme nausea, one was not provided. There were not enough toilets (3 for a bowel ward!) If they were in use (showers were in the toilets as well) you had nowhere to go despite having diarrhoea 20 times a day, which is common in Crohn's. I had a large infected abscess which required daily dressing and cleaning. Because I asked for a female instead of a male (the abscess was on my bum) I did not get the dressing for 3 days as some sort of punishment. It was then recorded that I had refused treatment and was being awkward. I told the staff that I could not swallow tablets, that I was nearly vomiting if I tried. They insisted on giving me horse pills (calcium supplement) and a terribly **vile** potassium drink despite making it clear to them I did not want it because I was physically unable to take it. I was then bullied into trying to swallow them and then feeling sick most of the night, under the guise that I would get a report to the doctor of \"non compliance with treatment\" and could get ejected from the hospital for it. The NHS patient rights leaflet says you have a perfect right to refuse treatment. This non compliance policy mainly applies to mental health patients (I am an ex MH patient) and I believe that they were being like that due to my diagnosis of mental illness previously. I was not provided with water when I was dehydrated. My friend had to go and fetch it, despite not being allowed in the kitchen for infection reasons, was told by a nurse to \"just go in anyway\". I noted that hygiene was bad, hand washing was inadequate, hand gel was applied on its own which does not kill C Diff. Had I caught that, I'd have died. I was not allowed **any** proper pain relief. Paracetamol and Codeine was given, despite begging and pleading for something stronger. My sister has same illness (Crohn's) and got morphine. I was told I could not have it despite being in unbearable pain. I was then recorded to have \"refused treatment\" when I declined the weak pain relief due to it being pointless. My psychiatric maintenance drugs were withheld for 5 days, no reason was given. I could easily have become ill and it is highly stupid to stop suddenly due to relapse and withdrawal symptoms. I am now so afraid of this ward, I would rather suffer at home than go in there.", "My Grandad was in Royal Berkshire Hospital last year, when i was only 11 years old. As hard as this story is to tell, i want people to know how much this hurt.\r\nMy Grandad was ill and went into hospital for a water infection, a simple water infection, and came out with MRSA. He was placed in a private room, where his health deteriorated.\r\nHe went back to the care home, still with MRSA, and was never allowed to leave his room in case it spread. He went back into hospital where he died. He only went in for something simple and ended up with MRSA. I have never been in that hospital since and don't plan to soon.", "My husband went in for a hip replacement 22mths ago. He came back to the ward at 7pm and was in pain being sick and very drowsy, when I stayed with him. Left him about 8.30pm, worried, but my daughter said 'he is in good hands'. How wrong she was. Had a garbled phone call at 2.15am in the morning, telling me about what had happened, which I now think was a pack of lies. Rushed up with my son and daughter to the hospital all of us absolutely distraught. \r\nWhen a report was carried out it was proved to be 'clinical negligence' and I have lost a wonderful man. The nurse involved had no suspension, and was sent on two retraining programmes and monitored for a year. I have now been told that they feel 'she is of no further risk to patients'. All we have had is how sorry they are, and condolences. I can never forgive them.  ", "My wife had a bad episode of depression last year. She was diagnosed with severe depression and was suicidal. She was under the care of Lincolnshire Partnership Foundation Trust. I was disgusted at the lack of support available. Appointments were months apart, there was little monitoring of her condition and her wishes for treatment were disregarded. She reacts badly to most drugs and requested CBT. Her request was disregarded, and even when she was started on drugs she was left months between appointments so ended up for months on a drug that was not effective. \r\nAt one point the only support offered was the number of the crisis team. She was extremely suicidal and did indeed phone them numerous times - she never got an answer to her call. She informed staff that no -one was answering the crsis number and absoutely nothing was done. They refused to contact the team for her and she was told to just keep on trying. It took literally weeks for her to get an answer and even then no support was offered, no-one visited her to assess her - they were just a waste of time.\r\nIf it wasn't for the Samaritans my wife would be dead now.\r\nMy wife does not have a history of empty suicidal threats or of attempting to commit suicide. The crisis team had had no knowlege or contact with her before this episode.\r\nThis complete lack of interest and support may go some way to explaining why Lincolnshire has a higher than average suicide rate which does not seem to be improving.\r\nSurely someone who is suicidal should be monitored closely, contacted regularly and give a lot of support?\r\nIf my wife gets that ill again I will be moving her in with relativees in a different county - I genuinely believe I would be risking her life by leaving her in Lincolnshire.\r\n\r\n", "I am posting this because I read [Duffy's experience](https://www.patientopinion.org.uk/opinion.aspx?opinionID=8402) . My mother suffered a stroke 3 months ago. She had been having TIAs (transient ischemic attack) and in spite of being taken to hospital, she was sent home without a scan. She did not recover her vision. Her own GP got the date of a scan brought forward, but before it was done my mother suffered a massive stroke. Her treatment on the stroke unit was not very good. Although nurses were helping patients to feed, it was obviously something they did not enjoy. My mother was simply written off by the staff. I asked to speak to the consultant and had to submit a complaint that I had been given a chance to speak to him. I finally received an appt the day before they decided hurriedly to discharge my mother after just 5 weeks. I was working on that day and was not offered an alternative date. Against my wishes and my mother's, my siblings shoved her into a nursing home. She was not offered any rehabilitation. She has survived, but her condition is poor owing to lack of care and rehabilitation.", "From February \u2013 September 2008, I had been in very bad pain. It was abdominal pain, so I went to my GP on numerous occasions, to be told that it sounds like IBS and was prescribed Mebevourine and Fybogel, but still no investigation. So September 26th 2008, I was rushed to hospital for me to have an emergency operation as my bowel had burst (peritonitis) and had to have my stomach flushed with 12 litres of water and was on life support and was then taken to the intensive care unit for 2 months. Through this I now have a stoma, and I do believe my doctor could of done a lot more, as another 2 hours I would of died. But as I am here to live the tale, I am very lucky and so are my children.", "NHS Rotherham is also concerned to hear about your mother's experience.

Firstly I went to see my GP because of sever back pain. I was tested for a kidney infection but it came back clear. I was also referred to a physiotherapist at Nottingham County Council through work. I feel I was not correctly diagnosed by the doctors and I continued going to physiotherapy. The doctor did no tests to check if I had prostate cancer. \r\n\r\nMy pain got sever and I collapsed. I was taken into QMC Nottingham where I had an MRI scan. They found that I had prostate cancer which had spread to my spine. A tumor was trapping my spinal cord! I had several large operations whilst I was in hospital for several months.\r\n\r\nI now have to go to a spinal clinic every couple of months in the Urology department. I have to also see a psychiatrist because I have lost my job and can no longer play golf or tennis. I feel like I have been cheated because the GP failed to diagnose my cancer earlier. I feel like my life has been ruined just before my retirement. I am now fighting for compensation with the help of my solicitors. I have also changed doctors to Musters Medical Practice where I obtained a Patient Opinion leaflet. My previous GP has now resigned with no explanation why. I know wonder whether it is because of my mis-diagnoses. \r\n\r\nI feel very angry that it was not picked up early before the cancer had spread to his spine. If I was in so much pain, the doctor should have carried out a thorough checkup to find the cause. This has left me with no job, no chance of taking part in hobbies and I know find it difficult to walk. I feel all of this could have been avoided if I had been cared for properly. Nonetheless, the hospital care was very good, but obviously I feel it has come too late to really prevent the cancer from spreading to my spine. I was 59years old when this happened and I feel like I have lost the last years of retirement which I was very much looking forward to.", "My wife underwent surgery at Sheffield Northern General Hospital in July 2008, to replace a leaking aortic valve. Towards the end of November, she suffered a blood clot in her right leg and was rushed to Doncaster Royal Infirmary for surgery, after which she was moved to ward 18. \r\nTwo weeks after the operation, my wife suffered a heart attack and a stroke, but was kept on ward 18. Surely my wife should have received the care she needed on either the Coronary Care, Intensive Care or Stroke Unit. Although the nursing staff on ward 18 were wonderful, and I feel that I could single some individuals out by name for even higher praise, I do not think that my wife received the proper care she required while on ward 18. \r\nUnfortunately, after gradual deterioration and despite fighting her illness, my wife passed away whilst still on ward 18 earlier this month.\r\nI am extremely upset and feel cheated of what should have been a happy time during the twilight years of our lives. I would like to know as to where I go to in order to make an official complaint regarding the above, bearing in mind that my wife's death is the subject of an ongoing coroners inquest.", "Thank you for taking the time to talk about your experiences.

Denise Gardiner, PALS Manager at Doncaster Royal Infirmary, can be contacted on 01302 553140 or by [email](mailto:denise.gardiner@dbh.nhs.uk) . They should be able to clear up what further help you can expect to receive in this matter.", "I am now in St Charles Hospital Kensington, being forcibly injected with anti-psychotics every night.\r\nDuring my time inside, I have had the opportunity to \"inspect\" no less than four mental institutions, both NHS and private, and the strongest impression I gained was of collossal waste of fuel and energy. These places are kept at almost searingly hot temperatures, and the climate is like that of a hot, dry arid landscape. They could cause a global warming all by themselves.\r\nThese places often seem organised for the convenience of the nurses, who arrogate to themseves the patients' quiet rooms and computers, even locking them out of chapels and sanctuaries designated for their use. At South Kensington the daily papers always arrived in the middle of the night, presumably after the staff had finished with them. I myself am forcibly sedated. I wonder whether this is for my own good or to knock me out so that the nurses do not have to check on me.\r\nThe staff put the patients off speaking to me by telling them I have filthy habits, but the ones I have spoken to tell me they are worried about whether their money is being handled properly by staff. Apparently the way to ensure a patient's complaints will be disbeleived is to diagnose him or her as a paranoid schizophrenic.\r\nThe new Mental Health Act 2007 is a real Catch 22. It seems that the very fact that you have been committed to a mental institution is regarded as good reason for keeping you there, since you are an obviously vulnerable person. Vulnerable, that is, to people who want to commit you to a mental institution. \r\nI understand, from reading the hospital Daily Mail, that certain members of the House of Lords get paid vast sums of money for making sure acts like this one are passed without difficulty.\r\nPS: The scandal of male patients on female wards is as nothing to the scandal of male nurses on female wards.", "He has the Worst over him!\r\nMy two year old son first became ill with a bad case of the flu the week of the 7th Dec 2008. His symptoms included bad head cold runny nose, sneezing, coughing, restless sleep and a fluctuating temp from 36.9 reaching 39.8 on a number of occasions. I made an appointment to see a doctor at my local practice and was unable to see the family GP and was to be seen by another doctor who was relatively new to the practice. He checked my son over and said that kids are quick to recover from bouts of sickness and that \"he had the worst of it over him\" and that it was a viral infection and they don't prescribe any thing for this, but gave me some Paracetamol suspension and Ibuprofen suspension. I left the surgery very unsettled as I knew this was something more than just the cold/flu. \r\nChristmas came and went, my son was still ill. This bout had taken an awful lot out of him - he wasn't interested in Santa and his presents - he didn't open his presents till 3 days after Christmas, as he had no energy or interest. \r\nI contacted the out of hours doctor on the 28 Dec 2008, as he was still unwell and his temperature kept soaring reaching 40.3 at one stage. He asked to see him and I traveled the 20 miles to the doctor to be told again it was a virus and to continue giving him the Paracetamol and ibuprofen, I also came away with a linctus for his throat with all the coughing his throat was raw. With regards to the temperature, I was told to continue giving the medicine as this would eventually bring down his temp. Again I contacted my GP and was told that there was nothing more that I could do that I should just \"ride the storm\". \r\nOn the 8 Jan my son's temp reached an all time high of 41.2, again I contacted the out of hours doc and saw him and was told there was nothing more just to continue what I was doing and again wait for the infection to run it's course still no antibiotic! I explained that this was my first child and this was all new to me, as he had never been ill in his two and years till now - I was told this wouldn't be the last time he would catch all sorts of germs and that if there was no improvement within 10 days to contact them. By this stage, I had been continually dosing my son on a daily basis with the Paracetamol and Ibuprofen to keep his temp at bay although it was still high (39) in my eyes, as I continually monitored him! \r\nOn the 18 Jan, I again contacted my out of hours practice as his temp reached an astonishing 42.3 and I was out of my mind with worry and panicking. as I new that there was a possible risk of him convulsing. The doctor I spoke to on that occasion showed no concern with regards to his temp and told me to place him in a tepid bath and to give him fluids - this was a further problem as he had all but stopped eating and drinking and I couldn't get fluids into him.\r\nI made an emergency appointment with my GP first thing on the Monday (19 Jan) morning she was very concerned with him, as he was very lethargic showing no interest in anything and whining continuously still with head cold runny nose and high temp. At last we were given amoxicillin and she told me to bring him back first thing on Wednesday morning, as she wanted to keep an eye on him - she rang me on Tuesday just to see how things were going and to remind me that I was to call in the next morning. \r\nI took my son in on wed, my GP wasn't happy as far as she was concerned there was no improvement and rang straight through to the paed's rapid response unit at the Ulster hospital, where they were on standby waiting for us. It was a bit of a whirlwind were my son had lines coming out of him saline drips attached and various monitors. \r\nMy son was then diagnosed with tonsillitis and pneumonia, as he was not drinking the infection was being carried around in his blood as his kidneys weren't functioning as well as they should. The blood test that they carried out showed that the infection marker should have been around 15 -20 was reading an almighty 57. My husband and I were beside ourselves with worry and were unable to do anything but be at his side. To top it all, I had a call from someone from social services enquiring into why it took us so long to seek medical advice! I told them to check their facts and told them that this was through no fault of mine, as I felt that I had exasperated all means necessary to make my child well and that I felt the health services in my area did nothing to help me at such a worrying time only to advise me to continue giving the calpol suspension which I have now nicknamed the wonder drug! \r\nOn reflecting this whole ordeal, of which we are now on the other side, I have lost all confidence in my local GP service. I pray that in the future that this service moulds into something more than giving out the \"wonder drug\". Hopefully there will be a better paed's service, as I feel that the GPs are not sufficiently trained in this area of family medicine giving the wonder drug does not suffice treatment in my eyes!", "In August, 2008, I went to the doctors with an uncomfortable pain. I was told to take pain-killing tablets. Over the next five months, I saw three more doctors at the same surgery (keep up the tablets) until the final doctor sent me for a PSA Blood Test in January, 2009. I have now been diagnosed with Prostate Cancer, it could have been tested for and diagnosed last August. I had never heard of a PSA Test. Apparently this simple test is part of an NHS screening initiative that, quite obviously, is not being passed on to many patients; the men and  women who pay for the system are not being offered these simple, life saving tests. At 67 I was denied access to a simple test that would have saved my life.\r\n\r\nAfter looking after; caring for a severely disabled son (Cerebral Palsy) for 31 years, a son who died in 2004, I actually thought that my 'retirement' would be mine - no chance, it is now to be curtailed; cut short because I trusted the medical profession with my health.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in the Royal Marines, every detail of my career; my profession was monitored, scutinised daily, apparently, the medical profession seems to have no such scruples especially when it comes to the very serious matter of a persons health; patient safety a service, for which they are very well paid.\r\n\r\nLooking after my son was a trauma and his treatment by his health-centre should really have warned me as to what awaited me when my turn came. But I was far too close to the problem tending him as we did (his mother collapsed and died prematurely in 1998 aged 54) 24/7 and sleep deprivation and too much anxiety dulls the faculties. All of the above was avoidable and no doubt the 'postcode lottery' has played a part in my families final demise...  Please ask for screening tests even if you are not sure as to what you are asking for - its your life - look after it.  ", "I would like to complain about how our NHS dentistry system is currently run in regards to allocation/funding of treatments. I am a 38 year old female who had an accident when I was younger. I hit my mouth in a bicycle accident, which caused my two front teeth roots to not develop correctly. I had severe crooked front teeth that over lapped due to the trauma, but was never referred to an orthodontist at any stage prior to the age of 18. The trauma to my two front teeth was never picked up by any dentist at any of my normal appointments, despite many X rays at general appointments. I always attended my regular 6 month checks.\r\nI then had a skin cancer scare, and went for tests which luckily enough came back negative but during the consultation I told the Dr I had dark patches on my gums. She checked them and referred me Guys/St Thomas Hospital, where I was meant to be under the care of one consultant but dealt with two. They could see how distressed I was with the situation. I was told after many tests and x rays at Guys that, due to trauma, my roots in my front teeth had not fully developed and I also had a perio disease on top of this, which was never picked up by my normal dentist at my 6 month checks. I then was told I would start a treatment programme to eliminate the problem, I followed a strict regime of cleaning as advised.\r\nI was referred to the training college at Guys, and was treated by a student who, to be honest, was never supervised whilst treating me. I was not happy with this as, considering the extent of my problem, I felt I should have been treated by the consultant himself. After the treatment concluded, my gums were a mess due (I believe) to a student dealing with it. After 1 year, I approached a consultant (not my one) to ask if I could now have an orthodontic brace in order to align my teeth to assist with better cleaning.\r\nHe stated I could as all was under control now \u2013 my 2 front teeth were never treated during this 2 year period, although I constantly requested it. I had an infection in my UR1, which they left for 5 months. This had to be treated twice at dental emergency dept before they sent me for a root canal and after this I went ahead and got a brace privately. \u00a32,900 paid monthly as this was not available to me on the NHS due to my age.\r\nMy teeth had always caused me distress as I have never been able to smile and covered my mouth when laughing. It affected me throughout my whole life, causing me depression on 2 occasions, where I had to take time off work and this made me extremely unhappy. It has affected my work, as I have to speak and deal with the public and internal and external agencies but can't smile.\r\nI was feeling like I was getting somewhere when my brace went on, and continued to attend Guys for my usual deep cleaning. I was told my gums etc and condition were in good order. However, late last year 08 I was informed by my consultant that he was sorry to tell me that my 2 front teeth would eventually fall out. This was due to the short root problem, due to trauma, and the two teeth next to them could not hold a bridge and would weaken if implants were not put in and he would put in an application for me to obtain funding for 2 implants, as this would keep my bone in better condition. A bridge was not a good option, as it would weaken remaining teeth and bone support, and I was too young for dentures. He assured me that this was the best option for me, considering my circumstances. He stated he would do this immediately, in order for the teeth to be removed, as he wanted to take them out and start quickly whilst my brace was still on. They would do the implants, and attach 2 front teeth to my brace as a splint, as I would be toothless while I waited for the implants to take and then after 6 months the brace could be removed and the implants added. My treatment would then be complete and I would just need to come back every 6 months for cleaning.\r\nMy brace was due to come off months ago but due to having to wait for the treatment by Guys I had to leave it on longer than necessary as it was required to assist my implant treatment. I cant take it off as I cant eat due to my tooth which is so mobile I could pull it out with my hand. Due to the brace, a different consultant said I could have, both front teeth are now mobile and will fall out, hence the implant application.\r\nI was informed yesterday that a Dr had refused my consultants application and I am unable to have the implants my consultant wanted me to have. I am very distressed, upset and angry as I don't know what to do. I cant afford private treatment as implants are very expensive, but if I don't get them my long term prognosis for my other teeth would not be good, and in the end would cost the NHS far more to treat than 2 implants now to prevent further problems. I can't continue to keep my brace on but I can't take it off due to the condition of my 2 front teeth which are being held in by my brace.\r\nI have had appointment after appointment cancelled and it has taken a year for some sort of plan to be implemented, and my consultant was not even able to attend yesterdays appointment to tell me the news, as no doubt he was busy doing private work \u2013 therefore I was given the news at the end of my appointment by a student who just said by the way my consultants application was refused by another Dr, who I have never met.\r\nI don't know where to turn now or what to do \u2013 I am stuck in Limbo as I can't remove my brace even though I need to, as I cant eat with teeth this mobile. Guys have no treatment plan in place for me now, as the implant option was my treatment plan and even that took them a year to decide that was the best route.\r\nI am seeking legal advice at this time as I am annoyed that I was advised I could have a brace to straighten my two crooked front teeth, when they knew the teeth would eventually fall out, due to the short roots, so I have paid \u00a32,900 for nothing on their advice. Then I was told it was better I got the brace to move my teeth into alignment as it is better for the implant treatment\r\nI work hard, pay my taxes and what do I get for it? Who decides who is entitled to treatment and who is not? All this trauma, over the cost of \u00a34000 for my treatment, I have paid more than that with 5 months tax and NI. I am aware of a case where a drunk lad had a fight and knocked his tooth out fighting and he got an implant, that was of his own doing, mine is not and this will affect my life and job with no front teeth. I have never been a drain on the NHS and this is the first time I have been in such a position where I desperately need such treatment on the NHS\r\nApparently I was told by the student that my application was refused on the basis that I had periodontilitas disease, but I don't as it has been fully treated or I would not have been allowed to get a brace, as advised by a different consultant and my orthodontist Even after periodontilitas, which I have not had for a year now, specialists and dentists state you can have implants once this condition has cleared up and you have enough bone, which my consultant stated I do and you can prove good hygiene etc, which I have done for the last year at Guys. Therefore I feel I am being rejected for no valid reason other than budget. I feel I am not receiving the due care that I am entitled to and pay tax for. If the consultant (name no names), who is a top consultant did not think I met the criteria for this treatment, he would not have put forward the application in the first place. He stated the funding would come through in January and all my treatment would be completed by July.\r\nI have been dealing with this now for 2 years or more and can't cope anymore, its making me ill!", "Thank you for taking the time to talk about your experiences.

We waited 3 hrs to be seen, just for him to be told he had bad sinuses and they gave him antibiotics. The next day, he was even worse. He was vomiting and couldn't keep any water or tablets down, and the headache was even worse, if that was possible. So my daughter took him back to A&E again, where a Dr said he should have had a brain scan the night before and blood tests. So they kept him in, gave him a brain scan and did blood tests. They came back normal, but he was still in severe pain from his head, so they gave him a lumbar puncture and sent him home AGAIN still in severe pain. On arrival home after 15 mins, the hospital phoned to tell us he had viral meningitis, so our GP told us to go back to the same ward, the Selly Oak Admissions ward. When we got there they had no knowledge of us going back, so we had to sit for another 3 hrs to wait to be seen again, still with my son in severe pain and vomiting. They eventually got him a bed on another ward\r\nAnd would you believe it they sent him home the next day again, this was Friday. By Sunday morning I had to call an ambulance for him, as he was so violently sick and in pain that he couldn't even get out of bed or stand up with the pain.\r\nOnce again he was admitted then transferred to another hospital in the middle of the night, due to bed crisis. So they basically did nothing again, apart from put him on a drip, cause he was so dehydrated and sent him home again. He is now in his own bed and if I have to take him back in again because he is in anymore pain, I will not be responsible for what I will do the next time I have to sit there for another 4 hrs and go over it all again. None of these Drs seem to communicate with one another at all. I'm just preying to god this WAS the last time.", "Last August I was admitted to the Airedale Hospital in Keighley with acute bowel problems (severe diarrhoea).\r\nAfter spending 4-5 hrs in the A&E ward I was taken to another general ward where i was given a drink  which turned out to be a laxative! I spent the next 12 or more hours on a commode. No one came to see how i was that night.\r\nI was told to go home the folowing day and was discharged with my dirty underwear in a plastic bag, no proper shoes or socks on, and had to wait like that till a taxi came to take me home at 9pm at night.\r\nI still suffer daily and my wife has to wash my underwear daily. I did put in an official complaint which the  Healthcare Commission upheld and i have now proceeded to inform the ombudsman as i think a lot of aspects were not considered. I await now for the ombudsman's help, if possible.", "My mum experienced increasing memory problems over the last year of her life and when I went with her to the GP and suggested that she might be getting dementia, he just said  'I'll be the judge of that.'  Mum did not think she had any problems and it was hard to get anyone to take my concerns seriously.  She was also becoming increasingly frail and was losing her appetite.  We were up at the doctors again later in the year when she developed a protruding left eye.  I knew this might be a serious symptom but the GP just told me to continue with the glaucoma eyedrops which the hostipal had in fact discontinued on her previous visit.  However, the GP did do a memory test,  and agreed to refer her to the Memory Clinic, but they had a 3 month waiting list.  Mum did had an appointment at the RHH eye clinic so I hoped that they might be able to get to the bottom of what was wrong with mum.  It was a dreadful struggle to get mum up to the clinic; she was weak and not very mobile.  The consultant just said that the swelling was positional and to stop the eyedrops again.  I was devasted because I was sure mum was very ill.  Over the next 2 weeks she continued to deteriorate and when she finally could not get out of bed, I rang again for the GP, but it 2 hours later when the GP had still not arrived that I rang for the ambulance.  The paramedic who attended recognised straightaway how ill mum was and she was admitted to NGH.  Mum's GP arrived after the paramedic and took me aside and told me bluntly that the problem was a malignancy.  At the hospital, Mum was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer and died 9 days later.  \r\n\r\nIn all the time we were going to the GP in the last year, no blood tests, no observations, no X rays or investigations were done, so it is a puzzle how the GP was able to tell me on the day she was admitted to the NGH that she had cancer.  \r\n\r\nNow I know that if mum had been diagnosed earlier the outcome would most probably have been the same.  But this last year has been hell for mum and me.  We were unsupported and I had trouble at work because of the amount of time I increasingly needed to support mum.  If mum had been diagnosed, she would have had support and care from  the lung cancer nurse specialists, social services, Macmillan Nurses and may have died with dignity and in comfort at home or in a hospice.  As it was she died on a busy medical ward with me harassing the staff for analgesia because she looked in pain and uncomfortable for the last few days of her life.   \r\n\r\nI am so angry with the GP who failed us completely.  ", "In January 2001 at 73 my mother went onto a recovery ward after a subarachnoid haemorrhage. We realised after a while that whenever we visited she was always facing away from the window. She got several infections. She did not get better. She was not all there but she complained of some pain from bed sores. We were told that such sores were inevitable. \r\nBy May I had overcome objections from my brothers and had her moved to a private home in Putney. The sister there, who was ex-NHS, said I should see her sores for myself. I looked. I could see white pelvic bone at her hip. The sores went right down to her bones in several places. She died a week later. The sister concluded that the gravity of her sores indicated that she had not been moved much, if at all, whilst in the NHS. We were never informed of the severity of the sores. \r\nI assume that the ward doctors had never seen her naked and did not look at her body. \r\nOne of my brothers works for the NHS as a professor and qualified doctor. The other is HIV positive and has received good treatment. They did not want to know about my mother's sores after her death. They would not have wanted me to complain. I didn't. I should have.\r\nIt is very interesting to compare the reaction of those with medical training to bed sores. To my mother-in-law, a former deputy matron who worked in hospitals in the 60s, 70s and 80s and is now in her late sixties, bed sores are always an indication of poor treatment and incompetent care. This view was shared by her peers. \r\nTo my brother, now in his forties and to our other friends of his age who are doctors, bed sores are something that happens. They are part of life. This despite the advent of sophisticated water beds. \r\nI have no intention whatsoever of taking this further as a complaint. But I think that it shows the problems of long-term care nursing of the elderly.", "This is my father's story. He is now 86 and was first offered a hip replacement in April of last year. He asked to postpone this, as at that time he was medically well and my mother's need at that time (he felt) was greater, as she was due to go into hospital the next week for her hip op. She has severe Osteo and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as other medical problems. He felt he needed to be able to care for her when she came out of hospital.\nIn August 2008, when Dad's hip op was rescheduled, it was cancelled the night before the op, due to a problem with his blood, but no one informed us. So when we rang to see how the op had gone, late morning, we were then told it had not taken place.\nIt was rescheduled for October 2008, but two weeks before this he developed heart failure and was admitted to hospital, he had also been suffering with a rapid weight loss and loss of appetite. GP tests did not show anything. Again it was cancelled. A scan showed a large tumor growing on the left kidney and we were told although Dad was in chronic pain with his hip the most important thing was to get his kidney and the tumor removed.\nBy this time he was a high risk patient, so far as any surgery and anaesthetic. When we saw the urologist he said Dad did not need to have his kidney removed at this time, as the risk from surgery was so great, and the tumor was not actually giving him any problems but his hip was the priority. They decided on December 24th and contacted the orthopaedic consultant to say they felt it was a priority for Dad to have his hip operation.\nAll along we have had to insist a decision is made, regarding his hip. We lost 2 weeks due to Christmas. When I rang the consultant's secretary on 6 Jan 09, her first day back after Xmas, it was to be told that the consultant had gone on a sabbatical so he would not be doing Dad's op. She suggested we go back to the GP and get a new referral back to another consultant. In hindsight this may have been quicker.\nWe saw a new orthopaedic consultant on 13 January this year, who took over Dad's case from the previous consultant. At first he said he would not do Dad's op because of the risk and that he may die on the table. Dad is old but not stupid and has been making decisions for himself all his life. Again he said he would prefer death to the continued pain he is in, morphine does not even work. Eventually he said he would do the op if his anaesthetist was happy to anaesthetise Dad. He told us it would be the end of February or beginning of March this year.\nAt that time the consultant said his hip was so bad now a hip replacement would probably not be possible, but a 'Girdlestone' procedure (a resection arthroplasty of the hip) would be all he could do. I asked in January if he could do it any sooner as that was still another 6 weeks away. He said no he couldn't.\nHis anaesthetist agreed. I rang the consultant's secretary not having heard anything on the 2nd March. I was told it will not be March as the consultant is away on holiday for the month.\nI made a fuss (it seems to be the only way) and we now have a date for 17 April. This is nearly 4 months since the decision was made that his hip was the priority and urgent. And if I hadn't made a fuss, when would we have got a date?\nI understand and appreciate some of this is beyond others control; no one could have predicted Dad's medical problems. But I can't understand how he has been put to the bottom of list. He is in chronic pain, can now hardly walk at all. The longer it is left the worse he gets medically and the harder it will be to get him up on his feet after the op.\nWe fully realise we may lose our father, but this is his wish, to have the operation. We are committed to supporting him with this. His life is a living hell due to the pain and he has been considering going to Switzerland for euthanasia. Mentally I feel he has given up as he feels let down by the orthopaedic team. He still doesn't believe they will do the op, he feels he will not live to get the surgery done.\nI feel the Consultant did not want to do the op that is why he has left Dad so long, thinking he would die before he has to operate. In the last 6 months I have watched my father turn from a fairly healthy man to someone who is now almost unrecognisable. This is due to the cancer and the constant pain.\nI will be taking this further and writing a letter of complaint which will be sent to various people, asking for a full investigation as to why my father has been left to suffer in such a dreadful way.\nWhat I can't forgive is that there was no honesty. We weren't told the first consultant was going away on a sabbatical, we lost valuable time there, time Dad can't afford. If the second Orthopaedic Consultant had said no and left it at that we would have found other means of getting Dad his op, privately either here or abroad, but they have left him hanging on to deteriorate daily, with just a crumb of hope to keep him going until the next disappointment.\nI wonder why in a society where if a dog was suffering in such a way you would either operate or put it to sleep, has my father not been given the same consideration for his needs regarding the surgery, or his wishes to make an informed decision once the risks were laid on the line for him?\nI am disgusted with the hospital and the two orthopaedic consultants concerned.", "My son, who is 4 years old, suffered a 2nd febrile convulsion at the end of February.\r\nAfter calling the ambulance we were taken to Dewsbury Hospital A&E. The ambulance crew were very friendly and even carried my son down the stairs and to the ambulance.\r\nHowever in the A&E, I found the nurses and doctors very careless. My son had a very high temperature but they left him completely covered when they should have stripped him to allow him to cool down, they made us wait four and half hours for a doctor to find out what had caused the temperature.\r\nAt 12:15am the doctor came to see my son and very lazily and carelessly checked him, and as expected could not find the reason for the temperature, so they moved us to the childrens ward.\r\nWhen we entered the childrens ward, I was surprised to find the ward completely empty, apart from another child and his mum. I was pleased, thinking that we would be seen immediately, but hours went past, and at 2.30am I was feeling very tired and sleepy and my son was becoming hot again, and since we had come to the ward, no staff had come to see him, if he was okay or not. They didn't even see his face.\r\nSo I went to tell the nurse on duty (who was sat talking to her boyfriend or husband for an hour) to come and check his temparature. She came and checked him and told us that the doctor was on her way from the delivery suite. I sat back on the chair, hoping that if it was going to take long they would at least tell us to stay the night and give me a bed.\r\nBut another two hours passed. My husband was starting work at 4:30am and he was very tired after sitting on that chair for so long, so I told him to go home and once again asked the nurses how long it would take, as I would rather go home and see our GP in the morning if it was going to take long, but they said the doctor had rushed back to the delivery ward, but would come back soon.\r\nSo I sent my husband home and decided to wait another hour.\r\nIt reached 5am, my eyes were hurting after trying to keep them open, I couldn't let myself fall asleep in that chair, as no one was checking on my son, I had to do it myself. I would have rather been at home. After having enough, I couldn't wait any longer, I knew they were going to stretch it to the morning.\r\nSo I picked up my son who was asleep, got all our bags which had our clothes in (in case we had to stay), and walked out of the room. I was very angry, I had never seen such carelessness before and had least expected it to happen in our hospital.\r\nI told the nurses that I wasn't waiting any longer and would rather see our GP. Seeing this the nurses became tensed and told me to wait a while. When I refused and started walking to the door, the nurse came to me and asked me to fill in a form. I sat down next to the fish tank and waited for her, just then the doctor arrived apologising for the delay.\r\nI was shocked! All the time they kept telling me she was occupied with other patients, how could she have left a patient then? I understood it then, that they had just made me wait for no reason, or was there a reason - maybe it was racism? I don't know. We had never been ignored like this before, how could they do this to a 4 year old child? They had behaved like we were not even in that room. I was disgusted, how could things change to this extent in less than a year?\r\nIn March 2008, my son had suffered his first fit which was also due to tonsilitis, after that he had high temperatures but I had managed to cool him down. But the staff then had been very pleasent and very helpful, the ward was full of children at the time but the nurses had time to see all the children from time to time. And they knew the wait for the doctor would be long, so they had told us to stay the night and the doctor would see my son in the morning, but all through the night, the nurses had come to check on my son, I didn't have to look after him at all. I had been very happy when we had left the hospital, I thought our hospital was the best!\r\nI had never dreamed that our experience this time would have been this awful, or I would have never brought him to this hospital, I would have taken him elsewhere.\r\nI know that next time for any health problem, we will not go to Dewsbury hospital ever again.", "I had a friend take me to Perth Royal Infirmary on Sunday 1st of march 2009 at 15.30 unable to walk, to have what I was sure was a broken/fractured fibula in my left leg checked, (smaller bone of the lower leg). I was sent to x-ray, where I expressed concern that they were x-raying the leg from the wrong side, to be told they could see through the bone and it would make no difference. Back in A&E was told no break, it was tissue damage, and as such would not be giving me crutches. I then demanded a second opinion, where by the senior doctor in charge confirmed no break, but would give me painkillers. Ss in his opinion it should be as mobile as possible and I could sit in waiting area till they took effect to enable me to walk out of the place. Needless to say I left without the painkillers, on crutches. Subsequently I went to my own doctor to obtain painkillers. Then to my total dismay, I was called at home on Wednesday 4th, to be asked if I was still using the crutches, when I confirmed I was, I was informed that the leg was fractured, that I had to keep it elevated and to ensure I used the crutches, contrary to what I had already been told, and an appointment for Wednesday the 11th was made for orthopaedics. Unbelievably, the man in charge of A&E plus another doctor missed it, argued with me over crutches and had me leave in agony. I'm simply not impressed by the standard of care or professionalism in this hospital, never mind the possible consequences of further, more serious injury occurring, thus taking longer to heal, due to the mistakes of these \u2018professionals'.", "The Trust is extremely concerned to hear about the distressing experience which you describe.

The service and care I received in A and E was amazing, especially one nurse who just made the whole experience a little less distressing. However, when being referred the next day to Ward C6 for an op on my foot it all started to go downhill from there.\r\nThe main nurse was fine but not what I would say was reassuring. I was given a bed and from there in was mainly just left to it, no one made me aware of which was the emergency button, no one told me where the loo was. It really made one quite reliant on them, which would have been fine if they had been there, but often you felt as though they were resentful or just generally fed up that you needed something. \r\nWhen a nurse would come to visit me or give me pain killers they would not use the antibacterial gel, which I felt was a little worrying considering nearly everyone in that ward was very elderly, frail and had an operation wound of some sort. Often not being able to get a nurses attention with my buzzer, I would be forced to stand up with only one good foot and would see that they were all sat round the nurses station chatting!\r\nOnce seeing a nurse prepare to put a surgical glove, when she dropped it she just picked it up and put on her hand! Does this not defy the point of a surgical glove?\r\nThe part which was most distressing was the way they handled a female patient with dementia, she was so distressed and crying and confused, and really very, very, very rarely did anyone come and sit or explain to her what was happening and where she was.\r\nOne evening when she was waking up nearly every half an hour, they finally moved her bed near the nurses station. I think they were trying to change her sheets for one reason or another and she swore at them, and they all just laughed at her and said how she was a rude woman, I can only imagine how distressing that must be to a woman with dementia. \r\nI had an IV in my arm for antibiotics, and it was on this same night, they came along to put in a new drip, and literally 2 mins after they had gone I was in excruciating pain. I was crying and rocking back and forth, I rung my bell but they paid no attention, as I think they thought it was the woman with dementia.\r\nEventually the duty nurse came but he was not allowed to do anything, he said that the needle must have been jolted out and therefore the fluid was not going into my vein, he said he would tell the nurse. I waited and waited, 10 mins later I rang the bell again and he came again and was surprised that nurses still had not been. Eventually she came and stopped the fluid, gave me some codeine, but said she did not know what it was and I would have to wait for the doctor, she did not remove it.\r\nI waited for half an hour! And then to be told that the needle had been shifted out and he then had to put a new one on the other hand, I suffered severe bruising and just felt the whole experience was rather unnecessary.\r\nThe next morning I had been nil by mouth awaiting surgery, for some reason the ward was so hot, pretty awful in fact, when one is nil by mouth and not allowed any fluids. I went to have a shower, no one helped me carry my towel, soap and toothbrush. Carrying that as well as my crutches on both arms, was all pretty tricky!\r\nWhen leaving I felt very sick and dizzy, was sick even though my stomach was empty, eventually a doctor came along, obviously no one had read my notes as he had thought I had had the operation! Still feeling sick, I suggest to him that maybe I was dehydrated and he said that I had been on a hydration drip. I said no that was antibiotics, he looked slightly startled and got me on one right away.\r\nThe nurses who came on shift that morning were a bit better, but the whole time they seemed rude, aggressive and just as though they wished there were no patients. \r\nThe food was hideous and they did not take into account my coeliac disease and gave me tapioca for pudding, which I left.\r\nThe tea boy was rude and chatting up a nurse in front of all the patients, which I found very unprofessional. When this very frail old woman as asked if he could pass the tea to her that he had just poured into a beaker for her, he said, 'Sorry love I am not trained for that', and just left her. He did not even inform a nurse that she may need some help.\r\nThe surgeons were fantastic, and when the anaesthetist brought me back to the ward it showed me how the nurses could care for patients, if they just gave a damn about their job! He was amazing and stepped in to help the women next to me that had been asking for assistance all morning, but had been ignored.\r\nI was really dozy as I had been given an anti-sickness injection just before the op as well and I could not come around, but whilst dozing in and out I noticed the nurse was flicking through my magazine, I felt this very rude as it was my personal property. The physio came round and even though I was still half asleep they made me get up to do some walking as she was going in 10 mins, really was that necessary?\r\nOccasionally I would tell the nurses that one of the other patients wants help or is asking for something, and they would just say, \u201coh, yeah yeah\u201d and either \u201cshe has dementia\u201d as though this is a reason to ignore someone or \u201cin a minute\u201d. It just felt as though there was no shift handover catch up, no one read notes, and when they came round with the drugs they would just stick something in your ear, grab your arm and just shove a needle in your tummy.\r\nThere was just no communication at all and when nurses did speak, they were either patronising or rude. I am just thankful I was only in there for two days, and I feel sorry for those that are in there for a long time, one woman next to me had been in there for 4 weeks and had no visitors whilst I was there.\r\nI do not know why no one comes round with magazines, books or something, as you don't ever get spoken to, no fruit, or juice or salad. How are people supposed to get better when their mind, bodies and eventually their souls are destroyed by the whole experience?", "My father in law is an elderly gentleman of 95, and was sent to hospital from his care home with foot infections and was admitted to ward 10B. The staff on the ward initially settled him in and he seemed quite happy, but after a few days his health deteriorated. On the 12th Feb we visited to find he had not been fed for two days according to his food chart, on asking staff no one seemed to know why other than a statement from a nurse (he is nil by mouth i think). On discussing this with the ward sister, she was unaware of this and we got a \u201csorry i didn't know\u201d (yes he should have been fed). After this incident his health, when fed, improved considerably. On visiting again other issues with his and other peoples care on the ward were obvious to me (the ward at the time was under staffed due to the critical care required for a number of patients)\r\nOur main issue at this time was that he was left with no clothes on his lower body, with a pillow between his legs and he was covered in his own dirt. I requested for him to be cleaned on visiting and it was done right away, but the same evening my sister in law had to clean him as no staff available.\r\nOn discussing these issues with the nurse on duty her statement was, \u201cwe are not allowed to complain about staff shortages, we have been told just get on with it and muddle through\u201d. My father in law was not capable of walking or talking had open wounds on both wrists covered with bandages when discharged 11/3/09 to a nursing home and sadly died less than 48 hours later.\r\nI am disappointed with the performance of certain hospital staff particularly doctors (Consultant) who never discussed any of his issues during his months stay in hospital. Having complained about my fathers stay in hospital 3 years ago and he sadly died in ward 14B, a number of concerns i raised at the time and told they had been action clearly have not. This does not give me any confidence of NHS care policies being adhered to within this hospital. ", "A friend of mine has Parkinson's Disease, aggravated by other conditions.  He is 63 and lives alone.  He has been taken to A&E at the QEQM on several occasions for falls, cellulitus and related issues, and sent right back home just as soon as they could get him out the door...he has been sent home without so much as a call to his next of kin, in a taxi, in blood soaked clothes, to an empty flat with no food and no way of caring for himself or getting help.  Each time he has been back in hospital within weeks or even days.  Social Services, who are supposed to be providing a care package, do nothing, the person assigned to care for him is allocated half an hour a day and often leaves him unable to get up from his chair and with no food prepared. The hospital and SS say he is unsuitable for respite care, in spite of being disorientated and unable to take his medication regularly...and anyway, there are no beds and no-one available to look after his case.\r\n\r\nSo what's to be done? Clearly the general consensus is that he should just die quietly of something that won't take up too many resources...unfair?  Yes, I believe it is...on him and all the other chronically ill patients that are just getting pushed around from pillar to post until they give up.", "Following a recent hospital admission my wife had to attend Saturn Ward to have the IV line fitted to her arm replaced. She had been at home self administering her medication since being released.\r\nShe attended the ward at 2.30pm and was promptly seen at 3pm by the duty doctor and another nurse. The nurse administered the anaesthetic cream shortly after and prior to the doctor returning to replace the IV line.\r\nAt approximately 6.30pm she decided to walk to the nurse station on the ward to enquire when the procedure would be completed so she could return home. To her utmost surprise and dismay she was told that the off-going shift had not informed the on-coming shift of her presence and she had been \u201cforgotten about\u201d for 4 hours. \r\nStrangely, the doctor who had initially attended to her was still on shift at this time and actually saw her at the nurse station yet made no attempt to continue the treatment already started. To make matters even worse, whilst she was waiting in the day room another patient was brought into that room by two other nurses and that patient told them that she had been waiting to see a nurse.\r\nMy wife called me at approx 6.40pm to inform me of the above and I called to speak to the hospital manager immediately to make a formal complaint.\r\nThe procedure was eventually carried out after more anaesthetic cream had been administered and completed by 7.15pm. A simple 35-minute procedure had effectively taken the staff nearly 5 hours to complete and my wife had been left to suffer the anxiety of a procedure that she was already very uncomfortable dealing with. This is the fault of no-one but the members of staff immediately involved and their failings to hand over the information of a patient who had placed her trust and welfare in their direct care.\r\nQuite simply I am appalled and disgusted by the lack of care and understanding offered to my wife during this visit and insisted that this episode be formally investigated and those responsible dealt with as severely as the seriousness of the incident. I sent the above account to the hospital as a letter.\r\nBut now, almost a month later, we are still to receive a response from the hospital. Not even an apology has been forthcoming. It is a disgrace.", "I have been seeing my GP for the last 15 years with symptoms of hypothyroidism. My mother was hypothyroid. I have been told that it was my age, depression, stress etc., The thyroid blood tests all came back as 'normal' and despite my GP saying that my signs and symptoms were indicative of hypothyroidism, nothing was done for me.\r\nEventually in desperation I went to see a private thyroid and metabolic specialist who diagnosed hypothyroidism and adrenal fatigue. The subsequent tests confirmed his diagnosis. I started on adrenal support and then on Armour thyroid. I am now taking Armour, T3 and hydrocortisone.\r\nAfter I saw the private doctor I took the results of the tests to my GP. My GP did not regard them as being of any importance despite one test showed that my T3 was under range. My GP sent me for another blood test and this came back as 'normal'. \r\nI was worried that my hypothyroidism was not on my NHS medical records and asked to be seen by an endocrinologist at my local hospital. On the first visit I gave him an A4 sheet of paper full with all my signs and symptoms. On the second appointment with him he said I did not have a thyroid problem and discharged me. All my letters to him asking him to tell me why he discharged me and did not take into account my signs and symptoms and private test results were ignored.\r\nAs I received no satisfactory answers from him, I made a complaint to the hospital and asked for copies of my medical notes and test results.\r\nWhen I received copies of the thyroid scan it showed that I have Hashimoto's thyroiditis and hypothyroidism. And yet the endocrinologist said I did not have a thyroid problem. His letter to my GP said I was suffering from anxiety and depression. (Anxiety is an adrenal fatigue symptom and depression is a HypoT symptom.)\r\nI am absolutely disgusted that I have had no diagnosis of my hypothyroidism for nearly 15 years. I am disgusted that I have had to live with the almost debilitating symptoms of HypoT for almost 15 years. I am disgusted that I have been treated like a silly woman for almost 15 years.\r\nI am disgusted that I have been regarded as being an hypochondriac by my GP for almost 15 years. I am disgusted that my GP and a thyroid 'specialist' at the hospital are not able to see and understand the symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism. I am disgusted that the GP and endocrinologist only diagnose on blood tests. I am disgusted that I have still not been given an NHS diagnosis of hypothyroidism. I am disgusted that I am having to pay more money than I can afford for thyroid medication to allow me have a quality of life that the NHS are denying me.", "My mother was visiting us in Peterborough and had to go into Peterborough District hospital and have a blood transfusion. The day she was due to come home she caught c difficile. Before this she was very independent and lived by herself with no services and no real problems with any of her organs. She got diarrhoea and had to stay in hospital. Four people on the ward developed c difficile and they all were put in the same 4 bedded ward. This was meant to be an isolation unit with barrier nursing, infection control and so on ; but the infection control was abysmal, and even though I spoke to the infection control nurses whilst I was there and they said that they trained people \u2013 and I know they do \u2013 the fact is that even the basic commonsense things were wrong. So for example, some of the people with diarrhoea were soiling the bed so there was a big bin to put things in with a fully functioning foot pedal. I used this bin whilst I was staying with my mother, but the nurses were actually using their hands to open the lid of the soiled bin. Really basic things \u2013 one of the patients was receiving injections so the nurses would come in with the injection tray all set up and they would put the tray on the lid of the soil bin. So I mean what to me was really basic stuff \u2013 sometimes the nurses would just leave soiled bedding on the floor. And they didn't know what to tell patients relatives about what they should and shouldn't do about infection control. They didn't know for example that the alcohol hand wipe isn't any good for c difficile. One would say put on gloves while another would say you don't need to. It was just bad. I spoke to the Matron for the ward and she herself had to look on the internet to see what it said about infection control about c difficile. All sorts of things like that mainly around infection control. And the general care was pretty rubbish too. I took time off because I didn't feel I could leave my mother in that hospital alone. What I witnessed through being there all the time just reinforced my feelings. In the end my mother died.\r\n\r\nAll this was in December 2005 and I think that things have improved since then because I was recently a patient in the same hospital and staff take much more care about infection control now. But from what I saw this was because staff are worried about getting into trouble, not because they know it's the right thing to do. So there are 'clean hands' notices everywhere but I still heard staff saying \u2018Oh I'd better not come in the kitchen with my apron on because I'll get into trouble' \u2013 not because they realised that they shouldn't go into the kitchen with an apron straight after dealing with a patient. \r\n\r\nThanks for the opportunity for telling my story \u2013 I feel better for doing it.\r\n", "I cared for my Mum for 14 years.

She suffered dreadfully over 6 months, with 23 admissions in 24 weeks.\r\nHer consultant was a very arrogant man, who did not seem to listen to the opinion of his other fellow professionals. Not only did he deny her access to surgical investigation and treatment but also he denied her access to palliation, he took her off morphine in the last week of her life and she was offered Panadol when she was actually vomiting faeces.

She was very harsh and abrupt with me after I explained his symptoms which caused him to be confused. I informed her that he might appear drunk but that he was not and that it was the head pain that may make his speech slurred. She informed me the department was very busy and put the phone down on me.\r\nMy husband told me later that he pleaded for some pain killers and was sold some from the closed pharmacy. He had no cash on him and we were later sent a bill for this. He asked if he could stay overnight as he felt really ill and was told to go home to Scotland and get seen to there. He was thankfully picked up and taken to his firm's depot for the night.

Within days he'd had the tumour successfully operated on and removed.\r\nUnfortunately he later developed another brain tumour that was inoperable and consequently died in January 2009.\r\nI don't seek compensation in any form whatsoever.

He had to stay in hospital for months. Over this period of time he contracted an illness in hospital which he had to remain in isolation.\r\nThere were often times i would go up and he would be screaming and be just left to scream, nurses would not see me entering his isolated room and they would come in while i was there and say 'Oh, how long have you been here for?' I would always think the same: 'long enough.'\r\nWhen i would turn up his toys would always have been taken away and he looked like he'd been sitting bored. It came to the point i could not leave his side for a minute. There was always babies left screaming most of the time. i would go over and speak to them for 5 minutes and that's all they wanted, a toy and a little attention!\r\nA nurse also left my child's cot side down which resulted in him falling out. I asked to be moved hospital but this did not happen. After his operations if i knew something was wrong and he needed another operation i was not believed. I used to show them photos of the differences but still i would never be believed, and they would wait and then have to rush him back through to surgery when the signs became clearly visible to them.\r\nHe went through more than just this which was all bad, and as i have nurses as family they have told me to get private health insurance as this supposedly does make a massive difference to the care and attention you receive, even though she agreed it should not!\r\nHe is now a very quiet, nervous, even scared little boy and hates noise. Is this down to the treatment he experianced there as a baby? None of his sibblings are like this they are all loud, outgoing and confident.", "It was July 2008 and driving back home to England from a visit to Scotland my husband became very ill. I took over the wheel and left the motorway to look for the nearest hospital, Queen Margaret Hospital in Dunfermline. He was doubled up in pain and vomiting.\r\nWe were seen quite quickly and within an hour they said they were going to admit him for observation. Next day they phoned to say I could pick him up and take him home. They gave him painkillers.\r\nHe didn't look any better than when I had taken him in, so as soon as I returned home I took him to our own local hospital's A&E department. They opened the letter from Queen Elizabeth that was meant for his GP. That said they suspected it was his heart (though they had told us they thought it was food poisoning).\r\nOur own hospital had other ideas - my husband was immediately scheduled for emergency surgery, and he underwent an operation for a burst appendix. He almost died, the surgeon said it was one of the worst cases he had seen and he was lucky to make it, they had opened him up in five different places.\r\nWe've never reported this, but feel concerned that the doctors in Dunfermline seemed clueless as to how serious my husband's condition was, and they weren't even remotely correct in what they thought it was. Were they students? They were certainly young.\r\nWe hope our story will help prevent it from happening again.", "On Saturday 9th Feb 08 I was admitted to the royal Gwent hospital Newport Gwent with horrendous stomach pains which the consult on duty told his HSO was probobly a kidney stone and couldn't be appendix related. Over Saturday and Sunday the pain became worse and got unbearable, even the morphine failed to stem the pain. Still the hospital staff diagnosed my condition by feel alone. On Monday now in acute pain and difficulty the morning round again suggested my problems were related to a kidney stone. My wife became upset with the staff and at her insistance at 6pm on Monday evening I was given a CT scan. This revealed a burst appendix or peritonitis. after an emergency operation I was told that there was a real chance of not making it because of the poison effect of the 9 pints of body fluid removed from my cavity. Had I been scanned on the Saturday I would have had a small operational scar and been dealt with swiftly. As they didn't, because of costs, I was left in massive pain for 3 days and almost died of toxic poisioning caused by their incompetence. Sadly I now have a large appendix scar which has caused problems for the last year, all because of cost savings. Thank you Newport, remind me to be sick elsewhere next time.

On the morning of her hospital admission some four weeks earlier, I had washed and dressed her and supervised her descent downstairs. She then used her zimmer to sit in an armchair and as normal she chose to have a bit of a nap whilst I did other things. \r\nAfter half an hour later I tried to wake her but she was very slow to come round and her speech was mumbled and something was clearly the matter so I called an ambulance. At A+E she was more her usual self though over the previous weeks her appetite was poor and she needed lots of encouragement to drink tea/water.\r\nAt A+E Mum's vital signs and ECG readings were fine(Two months earlier her own Doctor had stated that apart from a little murmur her heart, B.P., lungs, kidneys, cholestorol and blood sugar were fine and within normal limits. Mum had been treated for Thrush(down below) and had recently had a suppository for constipation.\r\nThe hospital decided her only problem was dehydration and put her on an IV drip, which remained in situ for the next three weeks. She was not catheterised until the last few days. Some days she was left in bed, other days she was sat out. They decided to prescribe anti-depressants as a possible reason for poor appetite. I visited twice a day and mostly managed to get Mum to take two Ensure plus drinks and small amounts of home-made food. She started to communicate more spontaneously and we duetted in singing 'Early One Morning' (a home favourite).\r\nHowever, I voiced my concerns about swelling in her limbs but a Registered Nurse told me that this was nothing to worry about and was normal for someone whose body had been lacking food and fluid. A few days later I queried a noticeable 'wheeze' but the ward doctor ignored this and was more concerned about how I would manage Mum at home, now that she was not weight-bearing very well, having had no physio. Two days later I insisted she needed to be examined and the same Doctor then said \"She's got a bit of a wheeze\". \r\nThe following day I met with the Consultant and his Registrar and they said the plan was for Mum to come home the next week and that no chest infection had been found. Prior to this I had reported that Mum was severely constipated and insisted that an enema was necessary. Her tummy was also very distended. A micro-enema was administered with little result and a stronger enema was prescribed on 3rd March but this was never administered due to Mum's gradual deterioration. \r\nThe next day I was advised that Mum did, after all, have a slight chest infection and she commenced with anti-biotics though the following day these were withdrawn when an infection was not the cause of her poor health but closer examination of a chest X-ray revealed \"sticky-blood\" around the heart. \r\nThat weekend a Staff Nurse admitted to me that Mum's condition was due to fluid overload, apparently she had developed Pulmonary Oedema and suffered a \"cardiac event\" overnight. When I broached this with the Consultant he changed the subject and was more concerned that I accept his colleague's decision to flag-up as Do Not Resuscitate. I was devastated. \r\nOn Mum's final day, it was obvious she was in extreme pain and I insisted she be given some pain relief. The Doctor asked her if she was in pain but stoically she said \"No\" and chose not to prescribe anything. But I had seen her wince and cry out in pain and it wasn't until five hours later that a Nurse actually heard Mum cry out that this Nurse managed to persuade the Doctor to give Mum some Oromorphine. A few hours later Mum passed away following a final stronger dose of morphine.

At 3am, the night after the operation, I was awoken by my phone ringing. It was my father in a confused state asking me to take him home, as he hadn't eaten all day and had asked for a cup of tea because his blood sugar was going low. I phoned the ward and spoke to the staff nurse on duty that night and she told me he was not the only patient on the ward and he had to wait. I told her his blood sugar was dangerously low and he needed to eat something before he fell into a coma. She told he she had checked his sugar and it was fine. However, I later found out that was untrue. \r\nMy sister and I were so concerned that we went to the hospital that night. We spoke to a doctor in A&E and requested he go and check on my father, as we were afraid he would slip into a coma. A few hours later, I called the ward and spoke to the day staff on the ward who said that my father had broke 'protocol' by calling me and requesting help. The service was disgusting and the nurses who dealt with us were rude and obnoxious. My father told me that he had requested help to go to the loo and was told to do it in his bed as there were no staff, this is how he lay until the sheets were changed a few hours later. I stayed by my father for the three days that he was in hospital and can say it was the most distressing and stressful time. I can honestly say I feared for his safety, not from other patients, but from the nurses lack of care and attention. The tea lady who came around helped my father getting up and moving than any of the nurses did. A truly terrifying time.", "I have acute asthma. I suffered complete respiratory arrest and was in a coma in intensive care, where I also had a cardiac arrest. When I came off the ventilator the next week, I felt unable to breathe and a senior nurse told me in a very cruel manner that she was too busy and I was fine. I could not speak or move at all and the only choice left to me was to close my eyes, and accept that I would die! I arrested a few seconds later. The trauma of having to make that decision is with me always, and I have severe PTSD as a result.\r\nThe same nurse came to remove my central line 2weeks later and asked me before the procedure if I remembered her. I certainly did, but said no, as she was about to do a scary thing to me! I never reported this. I wish I had but too distressed even 2yrs later!", "My husband had a cancer op in 2006. Then radiotherapy, taking up over a year of treatment at St Marys, Portsmouth.\r\nHis last appointment was Dec 2007, when he was told he'd have 6 monthly check ups, bloods and bone scans etc for the following 10 years.\r\nEveryone we have spoken to has been going to St Marys Portsmouth for 6 monthly check ups, scans etc, since their ops. Yet my husband hasn't seen anyone since Dec 2007, despite calling the hospital to query this. As there were many mistakes during his treatment, etc, I'm concerned they are trying to lose him in the system.\r\nWe have called the hospital, written, and even gone to our GP, yet to date 2009 have had no communication from St Marys, is this how they fiddle the figures? At the cost of someones life?\r\nIf the cancer does come back I will be very angry and won't let it rest. Its not fair to anyone suffering like this. The worry is terrible for him not knowing if its growing somewhere again inside him.", "My Mum was admitted to Sunderland Royal Hospital following a fall sustaining a fractured neck of femer. She was operated on and 6 days later on New Years Eve she was discharged. She was still groggy as if she hadn't come round from the anesthetic.\r\nVisiting her in the residential home, the staff told me that there was a gaping wound on her hip and that they had been given dressings to dress it. As the carers were not trained nurses they contacted the district nurse.\r\nI was present when the nurse visited. She put a probe into the wound right down to the prosthetic hip. I requested a visit from the tissue viability nurse. When she visited the next day she had my Mum readmitted to hospital.\r\nThree days later when visiting we were told she was in theatre. No one had informed any of the family she was even going to theatre. 12 of her 13 children and grandchildren visited daily. No one signed a consent form and by that time my Mum did not have the mental capacity to understand and sign.\r\nWe requested a meeting with the consultant who came up with the old chestnut \"in her best interests\" to get round the omission legally.\r\nMy Mum had been moved all over the hospital and ended up on Ward E43. She died 10 days later. The room was so cold the physio put her cardigan on when she came in. The heat was OFF in January. The draughts were as bad as if there was no glass in the windows. The air mattress did not work and it took 3 days to get a replacement but as a result of the broken mattress Mum lay for a time on the bace resulting in a massive pressure sore. We took blankets in for her to keep warm.\r\nWe asked for pain killers for her and we were told the Dr couldnt write her up for controlled drugs as the dr did not know her. I told the nurse that Oramorph was NOT a CD and a Dr could write her up for any drug.\r\nThe nurse did not realise that there were 5 trained nurses and a pharmacologist in the family.\r\nThe following day a nurse came in and cut the strings of the skin traction without taking the pressure and releasing it gently. The result was that the muscles snapped back causing Mum immense pain.\r\nI thanked God when my Mum died. Even today I curse those nurses on E53 and the consultant.", "It began when my grand mother had a fall. She was taken to A&E at our local hospital, Russell Hall.\r\nCutting a long story short, my gran's blood pressure and pulse were checked, then we were left for hours and hours, with me having to go search for a nurse for pain relief and to see if we had been forgotten about. By this time it was 7.30pm approx, we had been there since 1.25pm.\r\nA doctor eventually arrived, sat my gran up, pressed her neck asking if it hurt, she replied no. At that the doctor said \"there is no need for an x-ray, not everyone needs them\". He gave us a prescription for cocodamol and a therapist to walk my nan up to A&E with a zimmer frame. She informed us that she was going to try my gran on some stairs, whilst this was happening I went to get her medication. I could see my gran was in a lot of pain, managing to get her home given a little to eat and drink and upstairs to bed. Next day she was vomiting even water back in still shouting with pain.\r\nI knew something more serious was going on, got her back to hospital eventually at approx 8pm. Again waiting and left alone for hour upon hour. At 2am the following morning a doctor came to see my gran and she was given an x-ray which showed she had a broken neck.\r\nThe nurses all of a sudden now seemed to be giving my gran some attention. A consultant was called in from home, who explained to me she was lucky to be alive, that the bone that had broke literally kept the head on the shoulders, it was only my gran's strong neck muscles that saved her. Also that this bone had splintered and a piece was lying and pressing on the spinal cord, one false move could sever this with fatal results. \r\nAt 7.20am she was eventually put on a ward. The care on that ward was disgusting. My gran obviously was immobilized so everything had to be done for her whilst she was gazing at the ceiling. At first she was fed but this started to fall off, she could not reach for drinks and was ignored for toileting needs. We even found when calling outside visiting hours to see if what my gran was saying was correct - the buzzer had been removed and put on the side table.\r\nWe waited quite often over an hour for a bed pan, the nurses would very often say do it in the bed.  Medication had been signed for as being given before the actual time. I was there also when medication had been given by mistake when it had been stopped! She used to cry \"get me out of here before i am dead\".\r\nOther patients were also being ignored. Nights and weekends were the worst. The one night there was only one member of staff alone working. I did complain and the hospital gave a reply, obviously covering up these facts. It is not just Stafford hospital.\r\nHow many more elderly patients have to endure this treatment or indeed die because of this? Nurses did not even give showers, only those who were able to go to a shower themselves had a shower. Nor washed anybody's hair or give pallative care. I had to brush my grans dentures, half the time they did not even bother to put them in. Also frequently had to wash my grans hands as they permanently had faeces under and around finger nails. I am a care worker and I would be sacked if I treated anyone with this level of substandard care and lack of dignity.\r\nI went home wondering if I would be seeing my gran for the last time every day. She would say to me do not complain until I am out of here, it will only make things worse for me here. But I could not.", "I went into the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, London while in labour with my 2nd baby. He was 2 weeks overdue but no-one had seemed bothered about this and it was only through me enquiring and researching that I had organised an induction.\r\nIn the end I didn't need it as I went into labour the night before. No-one had monitored me in the two weeks I was overdue and nobody seemed to be particulary interested. I had attended waterbirth workshops and intended to have a waterbirth in the birthing centre. My blood pressure was a bit high and I was on the borderline as to whether I could go to the birthing centre or may have to go to the regular labour ward.\r\nI was allowed to go to the birthing centre but the pool was occupied. I was introduced to my midwife and my heart sank. She didn't even look at me or say hello. She looked annoyed and told me she wasn't happy about me being in the birthing centre - as if I was to blame. She didn't communicate with me or my husband at all. She just put me on a baby monitor (I had wanted to have an active birth) and left.\r\nShe popped back in rarely and checked me, tutting and muttering to herself. She kept telling me I shouldn't be in there. I felt terrible. My husband was really angry but there was no-one to complain to, not even on reception. We thought about asking to change midwives, but then were worried that our care might be compromised if there was no-one to change with, as the angry midwife might be even angrier!\r\nI started pushing by myself and shouted to my husband to go and find (yes, find) the midwife. She walked in and my waters broke spectacularly across the room, filled with meconium. \"Meconium\" she shouted triumphantly, as though she had proved a point, and left the room!\r\nA few minutes later a crash team entered and took over. They were brilliant and my baby got his head stuck and also had shoulder dystocia. He needed a ventilator but was alright within a few minutes. The midwife still hadn't spoken one kind word to me.\r\nMy husband went home and I was left in a chair all night, no-one came to check on me until 8.30am when the shift changed. The new midwife was appalled at my treatment and made a bed up for me.\r\nI sincerely believe that if I'd had a good, kind, encouraging midwife that I could have delivered my baby by myself. I am now suffering from postnatal depression and I'm very angry about my treatment.", "Dear AKJ,\r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to post your comments about the care received by your father in law.  We are clearly concerned when patients or relatives identify areas where the care they have received from us is not up to a standard they would expect as we want to learn from such experiences.  \r\n\r\nHowever, while you raise a number of concerns in your posting it is difficult to answer these thoroughly without more details such as the name of your father in law and when he was admitted to the ward.  If you would like to write to our Chief Executive with more details a full investigation of your comments will take place.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Matron and staff of ward 10B have been made aware of your comments.\r\n", "My father, aged 80 years old, was treated in Warrington hospital during 2008. During his stay there he contracted C Difficile and hospital acquired pneumonia, resulting in his death.\r\nHis story has been publicised in the local papers recently, on Granada Reports and  is presently being edited by a national paper. After sending a complaint to the chief executive, consisting of over 39 pages of issues/concerns & detailed failings for the care and treatment of my Dad, the hospital carried-out a 'full and detailed' investigation, resulting in no less than 22 forms of apologies for their failings.\r\nThese failings were also later confirmed during Dad's inquest. The Coroner stated 'This was not Warrington's finest hour' in his summing up and also informed the consultant pathologist that he would be writing to the hospital about her evidence.\r\nMy family have completed the hospital's own formal complaint process - without being satisfied by their responses to our concerns - even though they have acknowledged failings and the poor care and treatment for Dad. They have not addressed the more serious issues relating to 'general care & treatment' of all patients. Our complaint is now being forwarded onto the Healthcare Commission for them to review.\r\nI'd like to identify just one more significant issue that clearly shows the generic approach to patients dying in this hospital. The hospital completed their 'open & transparent' investigation, and produced a report and personal action plan for the concerns we identified to them about Dad's complaint. However, what they failed to say was that they sent a report with almost the exact same contents, 6 months prior to Dad's death, to another family complaining. Both reports cover the same hospital, the same ward, the same nursing staff, the same issues and concerns, the same responses. Both patients died after contracting C Difficile. I have both reports in my possession.", "I had had digestive problems for quite some time, and after referring to my GP there was still no answer but then I noticed a hard lump under my right rib-cage. Due to my symptoms being digestive, I was referred to the colorectal dept at Leicester Royal Infirmary, and after a scan I was informed I had a \"massive\" kidney cyst and it was referred over to the General Hospital Leicester.\r\nNow a kidney cyst is nothing, but one the size of mine, 13.5 cms, requires investigating, or so says the BMJ. However I was given an appointment for nearly a year later. From my medical notes, which I obtained much later, they clearly indicated malignancy under the Bosniak classification system.\r\nUnder NICE rules a cancer diagnosis requires treatment to begin within a month. If they don't diagnose you, they can just ignore the results, no matter how clearly diagnostic they are. That's what happened to me.\r\nI couldn't go on with the digestive problems so most unwillingly my GP managed to persuade them to action. I can see from my blood results that my system was largely giving out by that stage, and my immune system was nearly gone. To my surprise I noted that I was given an HIV test, which no one told me or asked me about. Under NICE rules, not only should my consent be sought, but I should be counselled too, as it would invalidate any life insurance I had. I was clear, but the damage was done.\r\nI was slightly alarmed when the anaesthetist lifted my operating gown to give me an epidural as no one had checked my back at the pre-op and I have a large mole right where he had been indicated to put the needle. He put the needle in a vertebra lower, which as the incision was the width of my body under my ribcage had no effect.\r\nI wouldn't have minded but a nurse had been detailed to run the tip of a tissue across my belly, presumably to check that the anaesthetic was working. The pain was blinding and with 49 metal staples across my abdomen I reared up on heels and head (something I can't do when well) and slumped semi-conscious.\r\nI tolerated it until someone, I presume the surgeon came along, and he attempted the same thing. He nearly lost an arm. I didn't see his face as I was only intent on not allowing his arm to cause blinding pain to me.\r\nThey then brought along the 'pain team', a special team who specialise in providing pain relief and I got a manual morphine pump. By now I knew how to control the pain - by praying for sleep and not moving a muscle, and they were discomforted by my failure to use it and I tell no lie when I say the nurse leaned over and whispered to me \"We can tell how much you use the morphine and if you don't use it more we'll take it away\".\r\nI won't detail any more, other than to say that I feel the cancer services in Leicester are a shambles.", "I was 29 weeks pregnant, when I went into labour with my second baby and was admitted to Halifax hospital, who were fantastic. The staff were great, very friendly and care was immediately given when I needed it. I stayed in Halifax for two weeks and I can not fault the staff or the care. However, after 10 days I was rushed to the delivery suite at Halifax. I managed to hold onto the baby, but spent the night in the delivery room which was filthy. The bathroom walls were smeared with blood and there were blood splats on the floor! \r\nAfter two weeks, I was again rushed to the delivery suite but this time I had to be transferred to Huddersfield, as there were no special care beds at Halifax for my baby. The ambulance staff were great and I was transferred straight away. When I arrived, I was put on the monitors to check my contractions, which were coming at regular intervals. The midwife told us that I definitely wouldn't be having the baby as I wasn't in enough pain! After half an hour my waters broke, I told the midwife who checked and confirmed they had. But she still insisted I wouldn't be having the baby and I should have pethidin and go to sleep. She sent my partner home. \r\nAfter another half an hour I was in a lot of pain and asked for more pain killers. When I asked for an epidural, the midwife refused, saying I wasn't in proper labour, and took the baby monitors off me and said I should go to sleep. Shortly after, my waters completely went and I started bleeding and passing large bits of what looked like chopped liver. I rang the bell and no one came. I had to hunt through cupboards, as I was by myself, to find pads to put on the bed and clean clothes, during which I was in a lot of pain. I rang and rang the bell for an hour. I eventually managed to get to the door to shout for help. Bearing in mind that I was only 31 weeks pregnant and my baby would need a lot of help when born. \r\nEventually, after I had been alone for 2 hours, my midwife returned saying she hadn't come back because she thought I'd be asleep! I told her what had been happening, and told her about what I had been passing and that I was scared for my baby. She said she didn't need to look and it normal to bleed during labour! I insisted it wasn't and that something seemed seriously wrong. The monitors were put on and my baby was in serious distress and a more senior midwife and a team was called in for my baby. Everyone was in a panic, the 'senior' midwife seemed completely useless and was pushed aside by other midwifes. Midwifes were arguing about what to do, waving forceps about, saying my baby was about to die and that I needed a c section. There wasn't time for this, as I was in full blown labour, so they had to deliver. My midwife was shouting at me, because I was making a noise when I pushed! (with no pain relief!), and that I needed to put all my effort into pushing, not making noises as my baby and me were about to die! I feel this is absolutely not acceptable. \r\nMy baby was born in a terrible condition and had to be ventilated, as the placenta had completely come away before she was born (this is what I'd been passing). My baby was rushed to special care and no one would tell me if she was even alive! Leaving me thinking that my baby wasn't alive. I was stitched up, still with no pain relief. I was then told to get up straight away, pack my things up and have a shower as they needed the room so I had to be moved to the ward. After this I eventually found out my baby had lived.\r\nThe whole experience was absolutely disgraceful, the whole trauma could have been avoided if I had been checked on or someone had come when I first called. My baby thankfully is ok thanks to the wonderful staff who worked at Huddersfield SCBU.", "My mother died nearly 4 years ago at Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey.  She had been staying with us (luckily or she would have been alone) & after days of terrible diarrhoea almost collapsed, screaming with pain & was taken by ambulance to Frimley Park.  They took x-rays & diagnosed a urinary tract infection & sent her home.  24 hours later she was still screaming with pain & I again phoned for an ambulance, she was admitted & eventually operated on - they found she had a perforated bowel.\r\n\r\nShe then spent 2 1/2 weeks in intensive care (where she received very good treatment) before she died of (among other things) septicaemia.  If she had been admitted & diagnosed correctly the first time, I feel she would still be with me today.", "At 2am, a very elderly patient cut her head (which did not penetrate the skull) and went off to the Dorset County Hospital to be patched up. There were lots of delays, including a life-threateningly ill patient, who had to be dealt with first. The patient was therefore kept waiting, as she was considered to be in no danger. Altogether the patient was kept awake, despite her great age, for at least 24 hours! Additionally she was deprived of her most important ongoing medication and the necessary care that went with it. Accordingly, despite reassurances from the consultant of her welcome progress, she fails to make it just 6 hours later.", "In December 2007 my wife was diagnosed with cancer of the oesophagus. She underwent 2 courses of chemo and on March 3rd had a major 9 hour op where a large part of her tube was removed with the tumour and what was left moved up and re-stitched, her stomach was stitched much smaller and she would never have been able to eat a proper meal again. The surgeon explained that there was a 96% success rate, which we were very reassured by. She was recovering well in intensive care unit and 2 days after op she was moved to a general ward. At the time we thought it was very quick due to the nature of the op being the most major op undertaken at Queens. The next morning my wife rang me at home approx 8 am crying and asking for my help because she had been coughing severely all night and called out for help and nobody came after many calls. I immediately went to the hospital and by then she was surrounded by medical staff including the surgeon. He took me to one side and explained that an explosion had occurred around the operated area and he suspected that the stitches had been blown apart and the plan was to operate again. After the talk with the surgeon, I asked the Nursing staff why this should have happened and was told that there was not enough staff working the night, only 2 to 30 patients. The reason they said was that nurses quit due to the unrelenting pressure they are under. Ongoing from that my wife was subjected to 2 further big ops but sadly lost her fight for life on the 23rd of March. \r\nAfter this, I had meetings with the surgeon and other staff and put forward my opinion the facilities are insufficient. My main concern was the IT and HDU dept, which did not have enough beds for such a large catchment area. In my opinion had she stayed longer in the IT unit after the op I am convinced she would have survived. There was a separate room standing empty ready for the HDU unit but no nurses to run it! This would have meant over double the capacity available. Our family strongly believe that our much loved wife/mother/ (young) grandmother's death is the responsibility of the NHS Trust and the Government. For 3 weeks, she suffered intolerable pain, not able to eat or drink and a huge vertical rip down her tube seeping stomach acid into her body. The only positive comment is for the surgeon and the nursing staff who all tried there best to save her.", "Thank you for taking the time to give valuable feedback on your recent in-patient stay with Calderdale & Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust. These comments are captured and fed back into our organisation to help influence and improve the services we provide.

For the past years, it is very well known that our trust is not performing well. However, this is getting worse lately and has since had a detrimental effect on the patient's care. That's why I decided to share my concern here and hope that someone external can do something about this trust. I am not too sure what can be done to improve the current situation although the front line staffs like myself are doing what we can to help the patients.\r\nCurrently, we have a waiting list of 15+patients waiting to be admitted into acute inpatient bed for their mental health needs. All of these patients are acutely unwell, vunerable and present a significant risk to themselves and others. Most of them have been reviewed by two medical officers and both officers had completed medical recommendation to `section' the patient into a psychiatric hospital. However, in order to complete the `section' (Mental Health Act), the patients will need to be reviewed by the Approved Social Worker or AMP within the 14 days after the medical recommendation. There is a catch 22 here whereby the AMP can't complete the section unless there is a bed available for the patients to be `sectioned' into. Since there is no bed in the trust most of the time, these patients who are acutely unwell and present a risk to themselves/others are being left in the community and continue to present a risk to themselves, public and particularly their family members.\r\nLately, the situation has gone worse lately when the trust has been unable to locate a bed for more than 14 days and the medical recommendation are lapsing which means the patients have remained in the community for more than 14 days and their mental health continues to deteriote since their mental health needs are not being met. It is a matter of time someone is going to get hurt and it is either a member of public or the patients themselves. This is unacceptable and dangerous considering the trust couldn't identify a bed within 14 days for patients who need immediate hospital admission to prevent harm to themselves and others. In fact, lately, we had a patient sadly passed away while waiting for hospital admission. This patient was too seen by both medical officers and was recommended to be `sectioned' into hospital. His death may not be related to his mental health but If he was to be admitted into a hospital immediately or witin a reasonable time scale, his death can most likely to be prevented.\r\nI hope someone from the Department of Health/media is reading this and decided to do something about this. For anyone who knows anyone who is on the `waiting list', I will advise them the only way to get immediate hospital admission is through A&E since the trust will only take this seriously when they get `fined' for not able to locate a bed within 4 hours (compared to 14 days in the community). If the patient refused and is in a public place, please get the police to use their power sec 136 to convey the patient to a place of safety rather than being left in the community/family home.", "We are grateful for the opportunity to comment on this issue as we have been trying hard to provide speedy access to everyone who needs a period of treatment in the hospital. We all recognise that this is a particularly difficult time for both the person needing to be in hospital and their relatives and friends, and that any delay to the admission is an added stress. \r\nTo try and ensure that there is as little delay as possible in getting into the wards, we manage the beds across the city from a dedicated bed management team.\r\nRecently there has been some changes and disruption to the bed management team and this, combined with very heavy demand for in-patient treatment, has resulted in some delays in getting immediate access.\r\nWe have strengthened the bed management team by introducing a senior manager and we have seen a reduction in the delays in admitting people as a result. \r\nHowever there are occasions when it is unavoidable that there will be people on a waiting list for admission. In these circumstances we regularly review the circumstances and needs of those patients and ensure additional support for them in the community so that their needs are met in the most effective manner until a bed can be identified in the Trust or elsewhere. Today we are looking for beds for two people.\r\nAs a Trust we really want to be able to provide the best quality of services we can and so we need to hear of any problems as early as possible. For this reason we have a range of processes in place by which staff can raise any issues in order for us to work together to manage and resolve them.", "My Father was admitted into Good Hope Hospital for a hip replacement operation. He walked into the hospital a very fit and healthy man. He always had such a wonderful sense of humour, full of personality and was never short of a word or two to say.\r\nTwo days after he was admitted, he was taken down to surgery and after a 2 hour operation he was placed into a ward to recover. On that same day, I managed to speak to the doctor and he confirmed to me that the operation went very well and he was very positive that - with time - my father would make a full recovery.\r\nA short time after this conversation I was informed by the ward staff that he had contracted MRSA. Over the course of the following months my father was confined to isolation and placed in a single bed ward. We were told that the medical treatment being provided continued to prove unsuccessful and the MRSA developed into C. difficile. By this time my father was profoundly deaf and had completely lost his power of speech and I began to question the standard of care that he was receiving. I had a number of meetings with the doctor for whom I have respect for but unfortunately, had difficulty understanding due to the language barrier.\r\nDespite the clear pain that he was in, remarkably my fathers' condition began to improve. The doctor confirmed to us that he was pleased with my father's progress and finally after 6 months in hospital, it was agreed that he was ready to come home. My father would require medical care at home as he was completely bedridden and I was assured that this would be organised by the discharge team at Good Hope. As a family we spoke to my father and he was so looking forward to coming home to his wife and two little dogs that he missed so greatly.\r\nOver the next two months I kept in constant contact with the discharge team. I attended two case conferences in which we discussed the nature of care needed and the fact that family was always on hand to fully support. However, I felt like I was banging my head up against a brick wall.\r\nMy fathers file was passed to 3 separate \u2018team members' \u2013 the first person dealing with my fathers case went off sick, the second was also off sick so many times I found she was completely impossible to contact, and the third person that the file was handed to worked part-time. I found it increasingly difficult to believe that the \u2018discharge team' was giving my fathers case the attention with which they were entrusted.\r\nMy thoughts were later confirmed when it was suggested to me that my father should be put into a care home. However, as a family we made it clear that a care home was out of the question. Although his recovery was slow, we knew that he would have a better quality of life at home. As a result my father would continue to occupy a bed in Good Hope until the necessary care package was put in place.\r\nThe situation however, was about to take a dramatic turn. On a morning in March I was contacted by one of the ward sisters and was asked if I would like to come and see my father in visiting time that day because he was not well. Immediately I left my workplace and made my way to the hospital. On arriving into the ward I spoke to the nurse that was looking after my father and asked what was going on. The nurse replied that he was \u2018not too good today'. I continued to ask her exactly how unwell my father was and she replied that he was \u2018not very unwell, but just having a bad day'.\r\nWhen I finally got to see my father I could not believe what I was confronted with. He was delirious and did not recognise me. I had visited him a few days previously and could not believe the dramatic change in his condition. The staff failed to explain how seriously ill he was.\r\nThe following morning my daughter and I went to see my father thinking that he would be feeling a little better. When we arrived we were confronted with my father lying down completely flat on the bed and a oxygen mask on the side of the bed. The images of seeing my father like this will live with my daughter and I for the rest of out lives.\r\nImmediately we approached a ward sister who was incredibly blas\u00e9 and to be frank very rude to us. As we stood in the corridor she told us that she would \u2018be surprised if he lasted the day' and that she had decided not to call us in that morning because she knew that we had been to see him on the previous day. There was absolutely no empathy from this sister at all.\r\nThe sister continued to tell us that she felt it looked to her as if my father had given up because she claimed that he was refusing food and drink and kept removing the oxygen mask. We found this very difficult to believe because my father was such a positive person. When we returned to my father's bedside we found that the oxygen mask was completely away from his face and the drip that should have been providing nutrients was empty.\r\nWithin an hour and a half my father was dead. The cause of death written on the medical certificate was pneumonia. My mother and brother did not make it to the hospital in time to say goodbye. The next day we were told to come and collect my fathers' belongings and since then we have had no further contact with the hospital.\r\nI strongly feel that Good Hope Hospital has completely let my father down. I believe the standard of care that he received was way below that which any patient would expect. I am forcefully of the opinion that my father was not fed properly and was severely dehydrated.\r\nI believe that the staff on the ward failed to provide adequate and consistent aftercare to my father. There were many occasions when I would visit my father outside visiting hours and find him lying in heavily soiled sheets. I appreciated that the nurses were busy and had a list of patients to attend to. However, my father was in a side ward with MRSA and C. difficile - again, surely this should have made him a priority patient - if anything to prevent further infection spreading throughout the ward?\r\nI should make it clear that I strongly feel Good Hope Hospital completely let my father down. I believe the standard of nursing care provided to him on the ward was negligent - particularly within the final two weeks of his life. From the day my father was admitted to the hospital not one member of staff on the ward wilfully wanted to speak to me about my father's welfare. I am now overcome with regret for the day that my father walked into Good Hope Hospital.\r\nI am alarmed by the fact that we were told by a member of staff at the hospital only three weeks prior to my father's death that all of its managers had met to discuss exactly what to \u2018do' with my father due to the fact that their discharge team had been unable to put a care package in place and he was occupying a bed in a single ward at their hospital. They clearly wanted my father out.\r\nThis entire experience with Good Hope Hospital is extremely frightening. My father went in for a hip replacement operation and lost his precious life.", "My Father was admitted to Kings Lynn hospital for an aorta aneurysm operation on 12th Jan 09. He was in the operating theatre for 9.5-10 hours altogether. The surgeon telephoned me personally, to tell me why there was a delay etc. After several visits to critical care, we were concerned to his mental state, as he was very confused. They assured me this was normal due to all the drugs he had etc. His birthday was 23rd Jan, I visited and he opened all his cards and read them and ate some fruit we took him. On 26th he was moved to a side ward, he sat in bed talking and laughing with my brother and his partner. He was the same the next day and we were relieved that he was improving. However, the hospital closed to visitors on 29th due to sickness bug. \r\nI didn't visit again until 7th Feb. I was disgusted. Here is what I saw: he was sat in his own clothes soaked in urine, dirty cups were left out, his lunch (3 hours after lunchtime), a bottle of tablets, there was poo smeared on the floor on his clothes and his shoes, toilet roll with dirty toilet paper inside it, his legs were bright red, swollen and weeping. It was absolutely disgusting. His mental state had deteriorated to the point that he did not recognise us, couldn't speak. Upon complaining, a staff nurse came to me personally and apologised saying it the previous staff were responsible, they then moved him to a ward. \r\nA week later, on the Sunday, he was rushed back to Critical Care with internal bleeding, by the time we arrived (we live 70 miles away) he was in the operating theatre. The surgeon explained to us that his large bowel had disintegrated and his small bowel had wrapped itself around it to protect it, he told us the next 48 hours were critical for my father. The following Friday, I arrived to visit as he was being taken to theatre again, this was because his stitches were not knitting internally. I was told face to face by his surgeon that this was a hiccup and he was recovering slowly but surely. After 18 days on intensive care, he was moved back to a ward on the Thursday night. I visited Friday and I even put \u00a310 on his TV for him and he was watching the news and Cheltenham gold cup as I left. Saturday he was bleeding internally again and unfortunately he died in the early hours of Sunday morning. \r\nI feel that his care on the ward was sloppy and when you asked questions there was a language barrier, they did not understand me, they said. I feel that I have let my father down by not being more assertive and demanding his care was improved or by transferring him to a hospital more local to us, so we could have kept a closer eye on him and fed him etc. The day before he died, the hospital was closed to visitors yet again, third time since January. I have complained to the hospital and am arranging a meeting with them, but it should not have happened in the first place.", "My mother was admitted to Stafford hospital in April 2008. It was an emergency admission at about midnight. On arrival at a&e, they took my mother through one part & told my husband & I to go in the waiting area. We sat there for over 2 hours, until my husband went & asked the receptionist what was happening. She told him to sit down but he didn't, he wanted to know where my mother was, then we were allowed to go in to her. It was 4am when we left the hospital. The next day they operated. She was very poorly we were told she make not make it. She had a strangled hernia & gangrenous bowel. She managed to get over it and was recovering ok, as we thought. \r\nOne night, when we went, she said she rang for the nurse to help her go to the toilet because while she was in there she went off her legs so she needed help, but when the nurse came the nurse told her to get out of bed herself, the nurse said couldn't help as she was pregnant. My thought was that if she couldn't do the job she should not be working. \r\nAnother night, when she rang to go to the toilet, a nurse never came to her, and so she wet the bed. She rang again, this time a nurse did come, but when she told her that the bed was wet, the nurse told she would have to lie in it until the next day. We went to visit everyday. \r\nShe was not washed or bathed. It was 3 weeks before they took her for a bath and wash her hair & that was only done because I had to keep on to them to wash her hair. However, there was faeces on the floor and rails and it stunk in there. \r\nShe was told she might be able to come home on the Monday, so we went to the hospital with her things to find her in a bed. She looked worse than when we first took her into hospital. She had caught the noro virus. She was not getting any better. When we visited we had to wash and get dressed in apron and gloves, but from what we saw, the cleaners were just walking in and out of all the wards, not washing or getting dressed up, even going in to the isolation wards. Also some of the nurses didn't bother, so why were we asked to dress up? \r\nI had at one point asked if some help would be available with her when or if she finally came home, but all they said that there wasn't anybody. \r\nDuring the last week she was in hospital (4 weeks by now) mum was complaining of bed sores on her heels. When we saw them they looked as though she had not been treated. It was at this point I said I have had enough, I want to take her home. They let me take her back to my house. When she was discharged, the backs of her heels were red raw and skin protruding off the heel, so she could not wear any shoes or sandals. When we got mum home we contacted our doctor who arranged for the district nurse to visit. When the nurse saw the state of the bedsores she was disgusted that they had been allowed to get as bad as they were. She said this condition should have been treated much sooner. Mum eventually was able to look after herself and went back to her bungalow but she is still being treated (in March 2009) for sores on the back of her heels.", "My father was discharged from hospital in a disgraceful condition. It appeared that nursing staff had failed to empty his stoma bag after his lung op, and the smell from the bag hit me as soon as I approached him. The drainage site was red and angry, his stomach peg feed tube was absolutely filthy. His room had a broken window and the wind was howling in. I informed staff, but no one did anything about it. I had to tape the window up with duck tape, as my father was freezing and had just recovered from pneumonia.", "Dear DRPol, \r\n\r\nThank you for raising your concerns. \r\n\r\nThe PALS Team would welcome the opportunity for further discussion in respect of your concerns in order that these may be addressed. \r\n\r\nPlease do not hesitate to contact the PALS team on 0151 529 3287 if we can provide you with assistance in this matter.\r\n\r\nKind Regards, \r\n\r\nKelly Owen \r\n\r\nPALS Officer\r\n\r\n\r\n", "I am a relative of a patient in Ward 4.\r\nI am absolutely disgusted that a member of hospital staff openly discusses patients while out of work. I overheard a conversation a staff member was having at a pub. I want to let you know so this does not happen in the future.\r\nMy father has been in hospital and if I knew this is what happened I would have arranged for him to be moved.\r\n", "My Mum was admitted to Southend University Hospital on 11th February with a UTI (urinary tract infection) and chest infection. Mum was 90 years of age, suffering type 2 diabetes for decades and vascular senile dementia. We waited in A&E from 5.00pm until 1.30am, until she was sent to AMU (acute medical unit), we left her at 2.00am on 12th Feb. She was admitted to Eleanor Hobbs Ward at 10.00am that day. I had been advised by staff at A&E to not continue giving mum the antibiotics prescribed by her GP for the UTI. When she got to the ward she was soaked in urine and faeces.\r\nShe was treated for the diabetes, as her blood sugar levels had been high for some time, diabetic nurses had advised insulin a year before, but the GP stated that blood screening (twice yearly) indicated that there was no significant kidney impairment and continued with gliclazide and metformin.\r\nIt took medical team 6 days to take a urine spec. for histology which indicated a UTI and they began treatment. During this time mum had been given sugar in drinks, as domestic staff asked her if she wanted it! (senile dementia!). We maintained full cover for all visiting times, and mum's three main carers including myself, my sister and another family member reported any concerns, which were many, to staff.\r\nWe had found mum's medication on the floor, as mum had not been supervised with this, no water given etc. We found her soaked in urine, faeces, other patients wearing her clothes, no slippers on her, insufficient clothing. The list is really endless.\r\nOne week after her admission, she was declared medically fit for discharge, pressure brought to bear for us to identify a residential home for her, initially for a four week assessment period, as she had sustained three falls and really her care needs had surpassed what we could provide. She had been living in her own flat.\r\nOn 22nd February mum deteriorated and we were called to the hospital as she had gone into renal failure. Mum died at 2.55 on 23rd February. It was not an easy death, peaceful in her sleep, but distressed and bloated; we wonder if she was suffering in pain. We will, fortunately, never know.\r\nAll I know is that, when she had been previously admitted in June 2008 for an infected toe, (which is another long story of lack of medical care) she was discharged in a far worse condition that she had been before the admission. She was discharged with awful diarrhoea, that took us 6 hours to control.\r\nMum died on 23rd February of a UTI and Diabetic ketoacidosis. I know what causes this, and I think that the signs should have been identified before. In my opinion, the antibiotics should have been administered before, and they should make sure that diabetics are not given totally dangerous foods and drinks.\r\nWe feel that the lack of care was stunning in its enormity, and I hate to think of what will befall any elderly patient with any form of dementia, unable to speak out for themselves. OK mum was 90, and not that many get to that age, but we feel that staff should care more for patients, and take on board concerns of family. We had been caring for her since dad died in 2000, and knew her well, also administering her medication, supervising diet etc. etc. We all cared, this is the thing, we mourn her loss. My sister cannot push the image of mum's last hours from her mind. The attending doctor that night told us that they would not resus. which we agreed was the best thing, her pulse rate went below 50 and monitors sounded, but it took us running to staff to call them before anyone attended. It was a nightmare.\r\nMum is now at peace, we all wish that we could have done more, if not to save mum, then at least to have made her last hours better. I dread the day that any other members of our family, friends, or anyone else actually, as an elderly person gets admitted to any hospital where they will receive this level of care, be declared medically fit then die, from something that could, I think, be prevented. ", "I was admitted to Medlock ward in the Royal United Hospital in Bath, where I stayed for a period of 2 months, maybe a bit longer. I was having lots of fits and was being investigated for this.\r\nAt night time my parents ended up having to stay, as there did not seem to be enough staff, and sometimes I would be left fitting for long periods of time before anyone noticed.\r\nLater on in my stay, I was accused of \"faking\" and staff decided that that was what was wrong with me and so were extremely rude to myself and my parents. My care went downhill from there. On one occasion I collapsed in the bathroom and hit my head. I was told this wouldn't have happened if I wasn't such an attention seeker.\r\nNursing assistants and registered nurses regularly called me crazy, a faker and an attention seeker. Whilst I continued fitting, staff assuming I was \"faking\" neglected to take necessary safety precautions and eventually when discharged I left with a broken wrist and a black eye.\r\nThe ward was often dirty and other elderly patients' food was left too far in front of them to be able to eat or drink. Doctor's communication with me was minimal and my care I feel was appalling.\r\nI was discharged with no follow up care plan or even a diagnosis and a few weeks later I was in intensive care, thankfully at a different hospital.", "My elderly mother was rushed into West Middlesex University Hopsital. The treatment toward her that followed was slammed by a Healthcare Commission's report.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, Mother was misdiagnosed serval times over from having to be returned to the hospital three times during a two week period. Mother was left waiting for many hours before she was ever seen by a doctor. On her second return to hospital via emergency ambulance - she was taken into an area of the hospital that had no connection to emergency patients, and she was lost inside the hospital for some considerable time before being found after a wide-spread search took place after we alerted the staff of her being missing. The staff had no record of mother being inside the hospital, even after this was carried-out by an ambulance!  \r\n\r\nMother was sworn at by an xray technician, this person failed to discover that mother had a broken foot after he took xrays - instead sent her home with an exercise sheet to complete a programe of exercises.\r\n\r\nMother was rushed into the same hospital again within days - after many hours of waiting, she was taken to a ward in the late hour of night. Mother was examined by a senior doctor, and again was misdiagnosed. Mother was left for over 24 hours without food or water. Mother was given incorrect medication.\r\n\r\nMother was attacked in the same ward by a mental health patient who was not a patient of the hospital. Simply, this person had wondered into the hospital, and into the ward unchallenged by any staff. The person became very agressive toward several patients before making verbal intentions of wanting to kill my mother. I was left to challenge this attacker whilst staff walked freely around the ward without any desire toward addressing the incident. The person who attack mother was known to both staff and the hospital, as she was a patient from weeks prior to mother being a patient. The attacker attacked two nurses when she was a patient, one of whom remained on sick leave due to her injuries!  \r\n\r\nMother was removed from the hospital's care by ourselves due to the lack of security, staff attention, care for her needs & failure too diagnose her health concerns (including a broken foot)\r\n\r\nMother was taken to another hospital where the treatment was instant, correct & without incident. Sadly, mother remains terrified of those around her (outside of family members) she remains in pain and restricted from movement due to the delay and poor advice toward her injuries. Mother has remained housebound due to the constant nightmares of flashbacks from the attack she endured whilst in the care of West Middlesex University Hospital.  \r\n\r\nI am still waiting for West Middlesex University Hosptal in Isleworth to respond toward compensating mother for their failures after two years of the Healthcare Commissions Report that accepted each and every area of our complaint.     ", "My wife was diagnosed with terminal cancer 3/1/08, and died 6/10/08 in Southend University hospital. During this period, I felt that her clinical and nursing care was appalling. All of this has been told to the hospital, and is subject to enquiry and review.\r\nAt times during her care, my wife's patient file notes were not made up, and often her patient record was not available. Her medication and pain relief was not always given when needed. Her discharge medication was sometimes not given, prescription ignored, or in sufficient quantity or missed off entirely. And her 24 hour chemo infusion was administered in 8 hours, despite 2 nurses who were legally bound to countersign the chart and check each others procedure. \r\nMy wife on another occasion became so ill, despite notes in the file and her drawing staffs attention at 11.30 a.m. to how she was feeling, and my doing so in the afternoon, that she subsequently had 2 fits. During the 2nd one, I was the only person available and alerted staff. They told her next day that a CT scan showed the cancer had spread to her brain. The impact of this news can only be imagined. Luckily an MRI scan, on analysis, showed this not to be the case. But the damage to our confidence was done. Finally, she had drain tube fitted, under a short medical procedure, to draw off fluid build up. The flow rate should have been controlled, but was allowed to free drain, which was completely wrong. I drew staff attention to this at the time and expressed my concern and increasing despair at what was happening. \r\nShe was discharged ill, which is agreed. The hospital failed to inform the districts nurses, standard procedure, of the discharge and management. They found out from me. She drained freely for 10 days, literally draining the life out of her with district Macmillan nurses and emergency call out doctor, apparently watching it happen, and my seeing her decline. She was readmitted to hospital with kidney failure. Her cancer was back, but this accelerated her decline. She was left for over 4 hours, by doctors who said she was not on their list. This had happened numerous times over the period of her illness. I felt some doctors and consultants had appalling attitudes, and arrogance seemed to prevail. \r\nShe survived a further 10 days in hospital before she died. I stayed for the whole time and, as I said at the review meeting, it was hell knowing what she had been through and what she went through in that period before she died. A lot more happened, but that is the essence of the story. It is scary and frightening that so much should happen to one person in such a short period of time, when she knew from the outset she only had 6 months to a year to live. She was remarkably brave, showed incredible strength and humility, did not want to be a burden, but I feel she was ultimately failed by a system meant to care but too bound up in justifying its own existence. This attitude was shown time and again from the highest to the lowest. And they didn't seem to follow their own complaints procedure correctly. This just adds insult to injury and the disdain with which I feel we were treated.", "My husband died 2 years gone january. He had lung cancer. He was taken into hospital 14 days before he died.\r\nThey knew he was dying and the care he got was none. He lost his hearing due to the treatment such as chemo and radiotherapy.\r\nHe was just left in his chair all day. One day my son went in and he never even had a drink all day. Myself and my mam went in one day and he was in a lot of pain. He told us that he never had his medication. This was around 2pm when we went to see the nurses. They said it was because he was asleep so they didn't wake him. There is no way he could sleep with the pain he suffered.\r\nHe also fell twice and cut himself. On both occasions i was not informed - i found out when i went in to visit him.\r\nThere is loads of other things that happened, and were very distressing for me and all the family. I know it seems like a long time ago but i still have sleepless nights over this. I hope this does not happen to anyone else.", "My mother went into Milton Keynes General Hospital in Dec 08 for a knee replacement.  Already a Parkinson and cancer patient she was not in good health.     Five days after her operation at 2 am she pressed her call bell to go to the loo.  After 30 mins a nurse  came along to my mum, ordered her to get off the bed (shouting nastily), then threw mum into the bedside chair and left here there until 7 am.  My mother wet herself after numerous calls and bells to the nurses.  The rest of the ladies in the ward also pressed their call bells but were totally ignored. Finally, the woman who was in the bed next to  Mum ordered a nurse to come and see to my mother and also called me at home.  We rushed to the hospital to find my mother highly distressed and when we questioned the staff, of course they had no knowledge of anything at all.  The matter was reported to the Matron.  After chasing him 9 times, I finally got a letter.  The nurse had denied everything.  The letter made no sense at all and as far as they were concerned the matter was closed.  So, in other words all this had been imagined everyone in the ward!  I really dont know how to take this matter further and would appreciate some advice.", "My father passed away at Stoke Mandeville Hospital on the 15th January this year.\r\nAfter two weeks he was sent to a rehabilitation ward as he was weak and was meant to receive Physiotherapy and rehabilitation so that he could go home and look after himself.  He received two visits from a physiotherapist who walked him to the end of the ward and back.\r\nHe got very depressed and was left sitting in a chair each day. On the wednesday prior to his death he told me he felt unwell, I told a nurse, who said he was fine.\r\n\r\nOn the Thursday he complained again that he felt unwell so my brother  spoke to the staff nurse on duty and asked to speak to the doctor, after a lengthy discussion the nurse said she would get the doctor to call one of us the next day. Nobody called the following morning so my brother contacted the ward again and eventually spoke to a doctor. My brother explained that my dad was ill, he suffered from Bronchiatesis due to a lobectomy during the war, the doctor seemed oblivious to the facts about his medical history. Finally the doctor agreed to investigate his problem an do blood test and a sputum test. That evening when we visited that evening he was on intravenous antibiotics & oxygen!\r\n\r\nWhen we asked why, we were told they thought he had an infection?\r\n\r\nOn the Saturday, we were very concerned about him as he hadn't eaten for days and no-one had made sure he had nourishment. That evening he asked for us as he was so ill and so my family and I sat with him on the ward all night.\r\n\r\nHowever! the nurses resented us being there, they said 'why are you here? we are treating him you know'.\r\n\r\nEventually we got him some food supplement drinks and were with him most of the time.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday evening he said he felt very ill again, I spoke to the nurse who I felt was very abrupt, and said 'we are treating him'. My father said he had a bad night and asked for us to be called, but nobody called us. We insisted that if he wanted us to be there they were to call us, they didn't until Wednesday morning when they called and said he was extremely ill and was being transferred to ITU.\r\n\r\nMy brother and I sat with him all night. There were two nurses for 24 beds. We had been told he was dying and could have morphine but when we asked we were told to wait because two nurses had to administer it and there were only two on the ward. My father died on Thursday at 1.30pm. It took 1 hr 20 mins for a doctor to come to the ward and release his body. It took 4 and a half hrs for another doctor to certify his death.\r\n\r\nThe next day my brother called the bereavement officer and she said that she had paged a doctor to sign the death forms at 9.00 and no-one had come. Her words were 'some patients have to wait days'. We eventually went to the hospital and insisted that the forms were completed but it was then too late to register his death and have the body removed by the funeral directors.   \r\n\r\nThe relatives room (quiet room) doubled as a meeting room and was absolutly filthy, the curtains were hanging down and one side was sellotaped to the wall. There were dead bugs on the windowsill and cobwebs.  \r\n \r\nMy dad fought in the D Day landings, he was wounded and was the only one in his company to return from France alive. He never complained, he was a true gentleman yet we feel that he was ridiculed by some staff, ignored, disrepected, and degraded. When he needed help, we felt it was not there. We mopped his brow, swabbed his mouth, gave him a urine bottle and held his hand while he died the staff did nothing.\r\n\r\nThe irony of it is he went into hospital because he had a fall and his death certificate read cause of death- Pneumonia hospital acquired!", "My husband was in hospital, when he was given a massive overdose and died as a consequence at the age of 35. We had been together for 20 years with 3 children, my life will never be the same again. The doctor and the nurses continue to work.", "Last Year our elderly Mother who for many years was being seen regularly by various Consultants at Nevill Hall Hospital ,Abergavenny for many serious conditions, had we recognized as a family , developed Vascular Dementia a fact which the Hospital eventually agreed with,this made providing her care requirements very difficult\r\nShe was admitted to this Hospital on numerous occasions during last year.On one occasion obviously very seriously ill,she was discharged the day after being admitted.Leading to an Emergency admission by Flashing Blue Light Ambulance the following day.We had to on a number of occasions protest vehemently to stop this happening again.\r\n        On visiting her on the Medical Assessment Unit Ward,we found her wandering around the Ward.She was at this time extremely confused,a fact we had pointed out previously to the Staff their because of our concerns she could fall out of bed and hurt herself.We found some of the staff on this unit to be extremely unhelpful and in one case very rude.We always make allowances because of the pressure and things that staff have to deal with but the lack of care was unacceptable.\r\nUpon being admitted and transferred up to a Ward her lack of treatment was deplorable.Apart from a few nurses,who ensured that she ate and drank something if one of the family could not be their at meal times to feed her,she could have starved to death or become totally dehydrated,causing the disorentation again.\r\nOne problem,a leg had broken skin,a problem she was discharged with on her previous stay their.A fact with her being diabetic that we had pointed out to them,without any avail.This leg progressively deteriorated,we kept bringing this to the attention of various senior staff members,expressing our growing concern at the severity of the leg problem.On one occasion her foot was black ,we knew the implications of this and raised this matter with staff.This led to the leg being totally concealed by dressings.It began to smell ,our Mother was asking about this,as we were because of the implications.On one occasion upon asking a Sister on the Ward,we were told it was a new type of dressing,something we did not believe.Another senior staff member on the Ward was particularly rude when we asked about our Mothers condition.Because of the very evident smell emanating around the Ward our mother was put in a side room.She also had to endure on a couple of occasions bouts of C.Difficile and it's effects.\r\n            Throughout this time we had only once been given any information from the Surgical team our Mother was under.Mum was obviously extremely poorly by now,suddenly they wanted to Transfer her to a Community Hospital where their was much less Health care available.We as a family stopped this happening as it was patently not in her best interests.\r\n                                 They were telling us that the Surgeon was on leave for two weeks and a problem that had been identified with blood supply to her foot needed surgery ,so they were trying to get a bed at another hospital where that Surgical team could deal with it but no bed was available.\r\n                                 Her health  deteriorated further and as we had been doing all along we were trying to get the medical attention she so obviously desperately needed,though by now we thought it much too late,she was in excruciating pain.\r\nWe extracted the truth from the Staff that as we had been saying for some time our Mum had Septicaemia.Suddenly the Surgical team said they were transferring her to another hospital to amputate her leg.We  rushed to Nevill Hall and got to the Ward with the Paramedics their waiting to take her.We expressed our total disagreement to the transfer and proposed surgery and eventually stopped this move because she was very clearly not well enough to move.\r\n            Our Mother who we wanted to have relief from her agony was then very heavily sedated and at last she received Specialist nursing care from very caring,kind staff leading up to her death their on the ward.\r\n         We have condensed the facts of a very traumatic ,sad event but feel thet the unnecessary suffering caused to our Mum and ourselves is inexcusable.The patient if possible and the relatives should be kept informed of any developements,concerns etc.We endlessly asked for facts and our concerns without being listened too. We find this to be totally unnacceptable.\r\n", "my dad was admitted to Leicester Royal Infirmary ward 19 on jan 15 2009. In July 2008 he had an amputation of his right leg above the knee due to vascular disease, and unfortunately his left leg was going the same. Dad had an appointment to see his consultant the following thursday, but he was in so much pain his GP referred him to the ward so he could see the consultant earlier. He was admitted to the ward on the thursday evening, left for about three hours before being seen to, eventually given a bed and that was when my brother left him. \r\nThe following evening, i went to visit my dad on that ward. I was shocked to see how much my dad had deteriorated, he was lying on the bed, very close to edge, with his left leg hanging out. I noticed there were a pot of tablets on the table, asked dad if he should of taken them, but he was so delerious i went to ask a nurse. She said would find out for me, i also asked for a jug of water and a beaker. About an hour later she returned to say yes he should of took the tablets at 6pm, it was now 8pm. I stressed my concerns about my dad, he was confused, in pain and \"very unwell\". i also asked if dad had received any treatment for his infection in his left leg. I was told dad hadnt had any treatment yet. also that he hadnt had a scan, and she didnt know if he had seen his consultant. \r\nI was left feeling frustrated that she really didnt seem concerned. She said to me \"dont worry bout your dad, we know him from before\". the patient opposite my dad advised me he HAD had a scan, at the bedside that day. The nurse seemed embarassed and left. the lady next to my dad said he had been very poorly and that she had helped to stop him falling out of bed, helping him with a drink and taking his pills because he couldnt manage and the nurse would leave his pills on the table and leave. she said no one bothered to check on my dad.  Unfortunately the visiting time had gone way past, it was 9 pm and reluctantly i left the ward.\r\nOn the saturday morning i raised my concerns with my brother, he rang the ward and the sister said my dad looked poorly.\r\ni was so concerned i went to the hosptal earlier than allowed, i found my dad in the same position as the day before. he looked very poorly and said he had been sick, i expressed my concerns again to a nurse, but she didnt do anything. my brother and i decided enough was enough and complained. a ward manager spoke with us and promised things would improve.\r\n\r\nthis is the list we complained about.\r\nDrugs not being administered, especially angina pills\r\nno assistance with dads toileting\r\nno drinks or food and assitance with both\r\nleaving dad without the bell for the nurse\r\nno observatiions\r\nno treatment for the infection\r\ncots sides not being used to prevent him falling\r\nignoring our concerns for dad\r\nignoring other patients concerns for dad\r\nforgetting my dad was in a bed on that ward\r\n\r\nthis meeting was at about 2pm\r\n\r\nafter this care and treatment was provided, but it was too little too late\r\n\r\nmy dad passed away just three hours later.\r\n\r\nwe are devastated and in our opinion dad should not have died. i believe it was because he wasnt given his angina pills and was neglected with the most basic of care.\r\n\r\n", "Many thanks for taking the time to post your comments, we really appreciate this being highlighted to us as we are committed to ensuring patient confidentiality at all times.\r\n\r\nYour comments have been passed on to the appropriate staff to share within their teams.\r\n\r\nShould you require any further information regarding Patient Confidentiality please contact the Patient Advice and Liaison Service on 0161 746 2019.", "Our daughter, Madison was transferred to Alder Hey Childrens Hospital to undergo a BT Shunt operation in 2005. Surgery was successfully carried out on the 23rd February and she was making a good recovery in intensive care. She was transferred to the high dependency unit on the 25th February with the view to being able to come home within a week.\r\nOn that evening she was given her 3rd lot of heparin intravenously, that was supposed to be 1,500 units of heparin mixed in 50ml of saline solution. It is our understanding that the staff nurse and charge nurse between them misread the doctor's handwriting in the prescription book; the doctor had written 1,500u instead of units and the nurses mistook this as 15,000. Over the next 24 hours the solution was slowly fed into our daughter until she died at 10.10pm the following evening (26th February) aged 10 weeks and 3 days.\r\nThere are supposed to be safeguards in place in the form of blood clot tests for patients on heparin (which is a blood thinning drug used after operations). It is our understanding that these were supposed to be carried out at 7am on the morning of the 26th but the nurse due to take them was late and between her and her charge nurse they neglected to do them until 3.30pm - 17 hours after the drugs first started being administered.\r\nWe went through 21 months of police investigations, an inquest, dealings with the CPS, a GMC enquiry and an NMC enquiry which is still ongoing.\r\nNo criminal charges were brought against the people involved, however the hospital trust admitted liability. Recommendations were made to try to prevent a similar tragedy occuring again.", "My father went to Wrightington Hospital for a simple knee operation. I believe that staff incompetence and lack of training killed my father. Previously he had a DVT which they seemed to totally ignore. They never gave my father TED stockings, Impulse pads or Flo-tron boots on the ward. He was also given the wrong diagnosis of a chest infection.", "My wife Sarah was seen by the radiologist, diagnosis benign polyp, no internal investigation carried out.\r\nThree months later Sarah had a scan and ultrasound carried out by the registrar, diagnosis benign polyp, again no internal investigation.\r\nA week later Sarah had operation to remove this polyp (a day procedure). This procedure failed - they could not remove the polyp, Sarah was told the polyp had been lassoed but was tough and rubbery and would have to come back in three months when a decision would be made on how to proceed.\r\nAgain no scrape or biopsy was taken, Sarah was told by the surgeon the polyp was benign, a letter to Sarah's GP from the hospital confirmed the surgeon's diagnosis.\r\nSarah was readmitted to the hospital after six weeks, when advanced cancer was diagnosed. She had a hysterectomy, recovered from the operation, then became infected with C. difficile and died.\r\nI am proceeding to take legal action for lack of care and incompetence.", "My 78 year old mother fell and broke her hip. She was rushed to A& E at Queens. The operation was a success and she was discharged.\r\nAt home she fell and an ambulance was called. The ambulance crew mishandled her when trying to get her into the 'stretcher' chair. The crew managed to get her bad leg (i.e. where the hip had been partially replaced) caught under the chair and this dislocated the hip.\r\nMy mum was taken to Queens again. This time she was left for over 36 hours before the hip was put back in place by the surgeon. She was recovering well when the nurses on the Amber A ward (the orthopaedic ward) manhandled her whilst in bed and dislocated her hip again. She waited over 6 hours and was suffering with the pain before any pain relief was given, and she waited for another 4 hours before going for an x-ray.\r\nMy mum then had her hip put back in place the next day. This time the legs were strapped together with a special cushion between her legs to hold the hip in place until she could be fitted with a special brace. We were told that this had been ordered and she would be measured and fitted the following morning.\r\nUntil the brace was fitted she had to remain in bed. My sister went to the hospital early so she could speak with the physiotherapist and check that the brace was going to be fitted. She was told the brace hadn't been ordered and the fitter had left the hospital. My mum was told she would have to stay as she was until the next week when the fitter next returned to the hospital.\r\nIn the afternoon one of the hospital staff asked my mum to roll over and wriggle around (on her bad side) so she could give her a bed pan, this was witnessed by my sister. My mum protested and said that she couldn't wriggle but the staff insisted. This caused my mum's hip to dislocate a 3rd time. The bandages were displaced and the cushion re-aligned in such a way as to cause extreme pain.\r\nShe has been on morphine now for 5 days and we are not certain when the hip is going to be sorted, my mum is extremely distressed, depressed and constantly crying. Then a doctor told staff that they could fit a brace (previously unavailable) and get her out of bed and walking although the hip is still dislocated. There was no way my mum could stand on it let alone walk.\r\nI am dismayed by the lack of staff care and inexperience in moving a patient in this specialised ward. It's dreadful.", "My 13 year old son was admitted to Barnsley General Hospital on the 13th May 2009 at around 7pm with suspected Appendicitis. On the 14th May at around 10am it was decided that he was to have an operation to remove his appendix early afternoon that day, which left my son very upset. After hours of watching my son suffer both physically and mentally he was at last seen by the Anaesthetist at 4pm_ish, where he informed us it would probably be an hour before he went down to the operating theatre. 2 hours later we were informed it would be, in the next 10 minutes. 30 minutes later we were told that we would have to wait even longer as there was an emergency caesarian to do. By now, my son was in more pain and in more distress. At around 9.30pm, we were told he was going down to theatre. The nurses were doing all the necessary checks and we were on the move, only to be stopped in our tracks and told we would have to wait even longer, as there was another emergency caesarian. It was turned 11.30pm when my son finally had his operation. By now I had lost all track of time and it was probably between 1-2 hours later that I was informed the operation was over and that my son had suffered a burst Appendix. My son and I spent just short of 6 days in hospital. He had antibiotics intravenously and suffered immense pain. It is a week since his operation and he is still suffering, his recovery is very slow. Such a simple operation when done in time, it could have been near fatal.\r\nSurely this is the NHS at its worst, totally unacceptable. P.S. The nurses were excellent!", "Where do I start?\r\nFirst experience two weeks ago required A+E assistance. Had to travel 10 miles to the nearest A+E through the busy congested town of Watford to get help because the local NHS trust saw fit to close the close the A+E unit in Hemel Hempstead which is much closer. Arrived at the hospital haemorrhaging due to a miscarriage two days before. Was checked over and sent up to the ward to be examined by the doctor who was not there but was apparently performing a caesarean section and I would have to wait until she was finished. In the meantime I could have bleed to death.\r\nThe nurse said \u2018A+E should not have sent you up here' - the ward had not been told I was coming, so they left me in a room bleeding profusely for an hour until a very nice lady doctor arrived. She asked several questions and examined me and attempted to explain that I should stay the night under observation. This I managed to fathom after several attempts at asking her to repeat what she was saying, the doctor had an extremely heavy Indian accent and I had real trouble understanding what she was saying to me. This was very frustrating.\r\nMy second incident involved a young ward nurse in the morning. I asked if she needed to examine the loss of blood like the duty nurse had done last night after I had been to the toilet. She looked at me with a blank expression and replied \u2018oh well if the other nurse has already done it I don't need too'. I explained again speaking slowly and she said \u2018oh I don't know how to remove the clot from the lavatory'. I explained that the nurse last night did it with a long pair of tweezers.\r\nI was carrying twins and there was a chance I might have been losing the second baby. The only way to check over the bank holiday weekend was to examine the blood loss. The nurse said \u2018ok I will come and check it'. I left the toilet and discovered the cleaner outside waiting to go in and clean, I asked the cleaner to please not pull the chain as the nurse needs to check something. The cleaning lady who spoke good English said ok, yet no sooner as my back was turned she went in to the toilet and pulled the chain flushing any evidence down the loo. I was very upset by this.\r\nThe young nurse came in to the room half an hour later and asked me what had happened. I explained what happened and said \u2018had you attended to me when I made the request this would not have happened', instead she just went back to the nurses station and was chatting to her young colleague. Then another nurse came in, presumably a senior and apologised followed by the cleaning lady who also said sorry. They then had the cheek to say \u2018do you think you have lost the baby?' I replied \u201cwho knows\u201d and \u201ctoo late now you flushed the evidence down the toilet\u201d.\r\nPrior to this event it was preceded by a dreadful nights sleep on the most uncomfortable bed ever. Provided with a blanket that looked as though it had been in use since the 1970s. It resembled a thin rag. I was only given one blanket, I was freezing so had to cover myself with my coat to keep warm. I did not sleep all night. \r\nI was asked if I wanted a cup of tea - this offer was certainly a welcome one. To my horror, I was handed a vending machine dispensed paper cup of what looked like dirty dishwater, the milk content tasted off.\r\nThis was followed later by a lunch time meal that was described as Shepherd's Pie and vegetables. Lets ignore for a moment that it was a child's size meal, it's smell resembled dog food. I wanted to keep an open mind and my hunger surpassed the unnatural odour. One small mouthful confirmed that I really should not have bothered. The potato had the consistency of cotton wool and tasted unnatural and the meat seemed no more than minced gristle and fat which in my opinion tasted foul. The veg was a pile of shredded raw carrot that had dried up and turned brown making it look like straw. The salad was ok though, I ate that. The trifle was just all mush with no fruit and I didn't like the taste. The yoghurt was a cheap brand I have never heard of so I did not risk it.\r\nI could not wait to get out of there and begged for the doctor to come and discharge me. The doctor came eventually after the sixth request, I'll be here in half an hour was the promise I was given. He did come to the ward once during this time but apparently forgot to come see me! He seemed to have a reasonable bedside manner however, until he said due to my symptoms the chances are I will have lost the other twin but suggested I took sometime off work. He went on to joke and say how he does not need much excuse himself to have time off work. Why was I not surprised?\r\nEach bed had its very own pull down TV with all Sky channels and you could apparently play computer games on and phone your family. I pulled it to me to call my husband only to be told by another patient that I would have to pay for a card which cost \u00a325 in order to use the equipment. She bought one three days ago but it had already run out. These things must have cost a couple of thousand pounds each and yet I didn't have a decent blanket on the bed. I would have paid happily for a nice warm comfy quilt.\r\nGiven that the ward was virtually empty, looks like these TVs are not paying for themselves and no doubt a large number of patients could not afford the \u00a325, anyway. Especially after they have been charged four pounds for twenty mins parking in the hospital car park for their previous six visits.\r\nNext episode.. As it became apparent after receiving another scan two days later confirming the second baby was ok, two weeks pass by and the bleeding started again. I had a pre-booked appointment with Hemel hospital for a scan for the Friday. I had been up all night in agonising pain and decided it best for my husband to drive me straight to the appointment. I concluded a scan would be the best and quickest way to establish what was happening.\r\nMine was an early morning appointment and we arrived with me in tears and doubled over in agony. The sonographer said to me, \"yeah, can you sit in this room and wait I have another lady waiting. I will try not to forget about you. We were not expecting you both to turn up on time\u201d. My thoughts were - this lady who is waiting is she in excruciating pain?  What happened to prioritising your work and using discretion?\r\nIf I had been the other lady who seemed to be waiting quite happily with a blossoming healthy bulge I would not have objected to waiting a little longer for someone who was clearly in trouble. But they left me to wait for 20mins. I have to say this woman did not instil any confidence in me at all, she was scruffily dressed and spoke poor English (even though I think she was of English descent).\r\nShe seemed uncomfortable with my distress and gave no advice to me at all. She called her female colleague to confirm her diagnosis that the baby had died, who again came in not wearing a white coat. She stood there, looked at the screen and said \u201cyea yea definitely no heart beat\u201d. I had absolutely no trust or faith in either of these two people. How can two women like that be trusted to carry out complex checks when they can not dress, speak and behave professionally?  I came out feeling completely devastated and clutching a bundle of information that she thrust in my hand and told me to read.\r\nI realised I had my first appointment with my midwife booked at St Albans Hospital for 12.00 noon, I figured there would be no point in wasting their time or mine as I was no longer pregnant. I tried to call to cancel the appointment - the phone rang for twelve minutes, as was the case last week. I thought the hospital must be closed. Eventually a young chap answered the call.\r\nI asked to be transferred to the Ante-Natal clinic. I waited and must not have heard his response. The next thing I know, he is shouting down the phone at me \"SAY THANK YOU\". I thought what for? did you say something? I was waiting to be transferred he must have said something that I did not hear and so he saw fit to shout down the phone and tell me off. I hate to think what happens to the hard of hearing or the elderly - do they get shouted at too?\r\nI was finally put through to Ante-Natal only to wait whilst the phone rang for 15 mins after which I gave up and hung up as I was feeling positively hung out to dry and angry as anything. The later events happened just today.\r\nI would like to opt out of paying the huge amount in NHS contributions and pay nothing because I hardly ever use their services and this is the way they treat people. I am off to purchase a private health care insurance policy for me and my family because I have no confidence in the NHS... let's not talk about MRSA.\r\nAm I angry and bitter? .....you bet!", "Cheshire and Wirral Partnership would like to thank this carer for the posting.  We are not yet in a position to provide a full response as we are currently engaged in a robust and rigorous investigation into the issues raised in this posting.  We hope the investigation will address these concerns and will identify valuable learning for the Trust to improve the services we offer.", "I am writing about by daughter's mental health problems and her care with the Cheshire and Wirral Partnership Trust. I found there was a consistent failure to respond and help her as the crisis developed despite repeated emergency appeals. There was a failure to understand the crisis when my daughter became a rushing door patient (1 day in hospital, 1 day out in a repeated sequence). The psychiatrist made all the decisions; he hadn't met my daughter before and I felt he paid no attention whatsoever to my comments, hers or her friends. I feel there was a failure of duty of care. She absconded from their poor treatment (in the psychiatric ward at later stage) three times, seeking help for herself. She was given an overdose of drugs and ended up in A&E and I had to watch her heart and respiration fail. At this stage I concluded what had happened (they didn't tell me). Based on my experience, I feel that the psychiatrists here do not believe in or work with families and no one questions or challenges their news! I feel that a challenging carer is alone- but (s)he is fighting for the patients right to life.", "In my opinion, Northampton General Hospital (NGH) caused both my mother and father suffering over a prolonged period of time, which I believe eventually led to the death of my father on 26th May 2008 and has left my mother barely alive owing to the most recent blunders by a GP and the uncaring attitude of a certain consultant at NGH.\r\nBriefly, my mother has had various operations at NGH to remove a section of her intestine and to repair a broken hip. The strain of these operations lead to a deterioration in her health and she has required more and more help from myself and my father. During a seven year period and up to date, my mother became completely reliant on my father and myself, with my dad having to care for her day and night just to do the basic things in life, such as go to the toilet and being fed. She no longer had any grip or power in her hands from her last hospital operation.\r\nTo get back to the present and the sequence of events that I am complaining about are as follows:\r\n1. On 5th May 2008 my Dad phoned for an ambulance to take Mum to hospital as he could not cope with her basic needs any longer and was having breathing problems. Mum was discharged and sent to a nursing home in Market Harborough (MH). Why so far from Northampton is beyond me. I was abroad and flew back on 6th May. I visited Mum on the 7th May and found the nursing home to be filthy; I saw sticky carpets, half eaten eggs and food lying on the floor, bed linen filthy etc. She had fallen on a number of occasions during her stay here causing severe bruising and swelling of her arms and knuckles.\r\n2. 9th May my Dad phoned for an ambulance as he was finding it hard to breath.\r\n3. Dad had a \u201cDoNotRevive\u201d (DNR) notice put onto he medical sheets whilst still in the Emergency Assessment Unit (AEU), without any consultation with family or even informing family. It was left for us to read this on his sheet and query it ourselves. I cannot help wondering if doctor decided he was not worth saving.\r\n4. Although my father seemed to have caring nursing staff around him on Dryden Ward, I find it hard to understand why a doctor should ask him questions such as \u201cHow do you feel about dying\u201d, without consulting me before the fact, not after. This really upset my father and he mentioned it several times to me in his last hours. Also a few days before his death, it looked like all medication was stopped and all he had was air and a nebuliser. Again it appears that it was pre-decided to let him die. I believe that a doctor slapping a DNR notice on him straight away meant there would only ever be one outcome \u2013 death.\r\n5. Finally, he had an appointment at NGH shortly before actually being admitted. This appointment was with a heart specialist at NGH. He said that my fathers' heart was not in good shape and he should no longer be a carer to my mother. But that was it, my father was still sent home with no agencies being contacted for assistance and he had to continue caring for my Mum until he could manage no longer. So maybe had some help been put into place then, he would not have suffered the heart attack.\r\nI could go on and on with picky little things which I considered inappropriate, but I will now get onto my mothers situation and my other complaints \u2013 especially in the days just after my fathers death.\r\nMy complaints against NGH for the way that my mother was treated in the last few weeks are as follows:\r\n1. After being sent all the way to Market Harborough Willows Nursing Home and with my father lying in NGH, I discovered that her GP at Danes Camp Surgery had made an appointment for her to attend Intergrated Surgery at NGH. The hospital would not provide an ambulance as she was in Leicestershire and out of their area (not her fault \u2013 this is where she was sent). So it was left to me to take her by car to NGH. My mother can no longer walk or hold herself upright and is like a dead weight for one person to manage. I suffer with Labarynthitus (vertigo), so it was an absolute nightmare for me to single handedly get her from Market Harborough to NGH. On reaching the hospital, no porter was available for ten minutes \u2013 which would have made her late for the appointment, so once again, on my own I had to get her out of the car and down to Intergrated Surgery. I am 65 and as I said suffer with vertigo, so it took all of my strength to struggle with her.. She was in tears and very distressed, so on reaching (IS) she was quickly ushered into a room so as not to upset other patients. When the doctor looked at her, he said to me that he did not think my mother would survive the examination needed to assess if she needed any surgery, as this would entail fasting for 24 hours, then having her system flushed out and a camera put into her. He intimated that she really should not have been referred so my mother and I suffered unnecessary distress for no good reason. As my father was in Dryden Ward, I then took my mother to the ward to see my father \u2013 they had been together for over 60 years so I thought it appropriate should anything happen with my father that at least Mum could say goodbye to my Dad. This seemed to upset staff and patients alike as both my parents were crying and very distressed.\r\n2. To cap the day off, I returned to my car to find an \u00a380 parking fine stuck on the windscreen. I had used my Mothers disabled badge as I was transporting her to NGH and I parked in what I thought was an disabled bay, staying for about 2 hours. I appealed against the fine (stating most of the above), but was told by the parking company that NGH had refused my appeal and that I was parked in a clearly marked \u201c30 min return bay\u201d. I had to go back to the hospital and look again when they said this, which is when I first saw it was marked on the roadway and as a car pulled out of the space and I pulled directly into it, I did not see the road markings. In fact I was more concerned with keeping my mother upright and safe in the car. Also by the time NGH refused my appeal, my Dad had died. Turning down my appeal was uncaring, unfeeling and money grabbing and certainly managed to rub salt into my grief \u2013 and I hate them for that!\r\n3. The next thing that I find despicable was the way my mother and I were treated on 31st May at NGH. It started with Market Harborough Nursing home calling a GP \u2013 who doesn't know my mothers past history, diagnosing a hernia problem and arranging for her to be admitted into NGH. The nursing home as not asked me about her past history. Had they done this, the GP would have realised that all she had was a water infection and given her a course of antibiotics (the hernia had been there since my mothers last operation on her stomach in NGH). I was informed that the GP had arranged an ambulance from NGH to take her into A&E, but after a 3 hour wait, there was still no sign of an ambulance. So once again it was left up to family to bring her by car from Mkt Harboro to NGH, which again was distressing for all concerned. When we arrived at A&E my mother was crying, in pain and very distressed and after lying around in A&E for a number of hours, was eventually seen by a lady doctor who seemed caring and knowledgeable. She said that possibly mum had some sort of kidney infection caused by her water infection. She told us that Mum would go to AEU, get a blood test, X-rays and possibly a scan to find out why she was in such pain and that she would stay in hospital, definitely all Sunday and probably longer until the results of the tests were through. My wife and I spent some time with her on the ward and she was very distraught, confused and frightened and really did not know what was going on.\r\n4. On Sunday 1st June I received a phone call from NGH saying that the hospital was discharging my mother home. I explained that she could not go home as my father had died five days earlier and he was her primary carer at home. The nurse in charge, then told me they would arrange an ambulance to take her back to Mkt Harboro Nursing home. I told the nurse that I did not want her sent back there as I considered the place to be filthy and my mother had fallen in their care on a number of occasions, causing her multiple bruising and swollen knuckles. The nurse was adamant that she leaves the hospital and on two occasions she actually put the phone down on me as I was talking to her. When I confronted her about this, her answer was \u201cI thought you were finished talking\u201d. This to me is completely unacceptable behaviour by a head nurse.\r\n5. To continue, on the day she was admitted into NGH (31st May), my wife and I had found a nursing home locally that would accept my mother subject to an assessment. So I arranged for an assessment to be carried out on the Monday 2nd June am. So even though we were told she would probably be kept in until all tests results were analysed, it seems that a consultant decided she did not need any tests and to discharge my mother from the hospital on Sunday even though I begged them to keep her overnight and she was in severe pain, confused and fightened and had been moved from pillar to post since my father died, people such as the head nurse (the person who put the phone down on me), the senior nurse on call who new the situation and last but no least, the consultant who I begged and told that my dad had just died, also fully new our situation, but was happy to discharge my mother. It seems funny how NGH were able to arrange an ambulance to discharge her back to Market Harborough, but were unable to get an ambulance to fetch her on two occasions. I wonder if the hospital is merely trying to meet government targets by turning around patient numbers. My mother did not receive the sort of help she needed and after the trauma she suffered she is now like a vegetable, for which I hold the aforementioned people entirely responsible for the despicable way which she was treated. The bed manager said that she was only acting on orders from her superiors, that she felt what was done to my mother was wrong.\r\nSo to sum up. I hold NGH fully responsible for:\r\n1. In the week prior to his heart attack, telling my father that he cannot care for my mother any more \u2013 yet sending him home to continue doing just that and not informing any agency of the situation.\r\n2. Attaching a DNR notice to my Dads medical sheets without any consultation, even before he went on the ward.\r\n3. A doctor on Dryden Ward asking my father what he thought about dying \u2013 which I know upset my Dad in his last hours because he kept telling me that he thought it to be not a nice thing to say to someone.\r\n4. Why was all the medication bar the air and nebuliser stopped a few days prior to his death \u2013 could that be anything to do with the DNR notice?\r\n5. Why did the hospital not assist with ambulance to get my mother to an appointment at Intergrated Surgery, but left it to me (aged 65 with vertigo) to manhandle her, causing us both distress, only to be told it was a waste of time coming to the appointment as she would possibly not survive the pre-op investigation. Also as mentioned previously, I was fined by NGH, as well as I had to get my mother back to Market Harboro without any help from anybody.\r\n6. When my mother was sent to NGH on May 31st, the GP asked for an ambulance to collect her \u2013 but we waited for over 3 hours and in the end had to get her by car to A&E. Why couldn't the hospital have let us know that they were not sending an ambulance?\r\n7. Though my mother had been referred by the GP, when we arrived, nobody seemed to know anything and she spent hours lying in A&E frightened, confused and in severe pain, after asking several nurses, we eventually got her some pain relief.\r\n8. After about 4 hours, my Mum was eventually seen by a lady doctor who checked her out, thought she might have a water infection affecting her kidneys saying they would carry out tests as already mentioned to determine the problem. All this time my mother was calling for help \u2013 she is 86, has been through hell over the previous days and weeks \u2013 let along the last 7 years and to top it all her husband (my father) had died 5 days previously. We were told she would definitely stay in hospital Sunday and probably until the results of tests came through.\r\n9. Why after the careful examination, did the consultant decide no tests were needed and discharge her from the hospital the next day. He must have seen what we saw, which was a pitiful, weak, frightened and confused elderly person that needed a little care and compassion. Yet although I pleaded and explained all she had been through, he decided she should go.\r\n10. Without any help or support from NGH my wife and I were able to get my mother admitted into a wonderful caring environment called Raunds Lodge Nursing Home, but with the traumatic stay in NGH and the treatment (or should I say non-treatment) she had received at the NGH, my Mum has changed out of all recognition, bringing her Grandson to tears and upsetting my whole family.\r\nMy experience with NGH over the years and more recently, leads me to the conclusion that you have major problems that need sorting out. Elderly people in NGH are not pieces of meat and I would expect them to be shown respect and dignity and also doctors should be held to account for their actions as well as GPs.\r\nPlease note that both my parents are now dead and I maintain their deaths are primarily due to the way they were treated by the NHS Trust of Northampton General Hospital.\r\nAlso I got a final reply to all my points above in December 2008, after months of excuses and I no longer had the will to continue my fight for justice for my Parents - my Mum died on January 1st 2009 and I feel that your programme about Patient care, nurses and doctors in the NHS is just the tip of the iceberg and it is much worse than even your programme portrayed. Answers given by Government ministers and the NHS Trusts always talk down to us and it's a \"pass the buck\" culture that needs to be stamped out. It sickens me to have witnessed what happened to my mother and father and the attitudes of some of the \"so called\" nursing staff.\r\n", "Last year about June/July time I noticed a lump in my neck, as I am a transplant patient I told my doctor at renal clinic. He examined me and told me it was nothing to worry about, it was just a fat tissue lump. I wasn't so sure as I've other fat tissue lumps and this was nothing like them as this lump had a swelling around it. But the doctor reassured me it was nothing to worry about. About a month to six weeks later the lump was starting to bother me so I told the doctor at renal clinic my concerns, but he just said we know all about it, it's not serious, don't worry. Around October time my partner who was suffering from cancer fell poorly so I called my GP out from Stonecroft medical centre. I told him about this lump so he examined me and said he would organise a ultra sound for me, which he did. My appointment came but unfortunately my partner passed away the day before so I cancelled it. The date for my ultra sound was 1st November 2008.\r\n\tTime passed by but a later appointment never arrived so early in 2009 I told my doctor at renal clinic and my GP. Only my GP said he would look into it for me, but nothing came of it. About the middle of May I started getting pains up the left side of my face so I told the doctor at the renal clinic. They examined me again and this time they said I should have a biopsy on the lump. The result of this was I had abnormal cells so they sent me to see an oncologist. They arranged further investigations which led me being diagnosed with throat cancer. I am very angry with the way I was dismissed with my worries about the lump in the first place! As the result of my poor care over the last 10 months to a year, I have to put aside with dealing with the loss of my partner of 27 years to concentrate on fighting cancer myself. I also feel so let down by the NHS because all this is put down to money. In the doctors opinion I wasn't in no danger, it wasn't serious enough so they didn't bother with all these tests as it would have been a waste of time and money. The same thing happened with my partner, she was told she was too young to get breast cancer so they didn't bother no ultra sound or biopsy and where is she now? Six feet under. So I have so much to thank the NHS for, I don't think so!!\r\n", "I was admitted to the Norbury Ward at Stepping Hill Hospital in April. I was admitted due to being unaware of the dangerous effects of suddenly stopping a high dose of diazepam. I also suffer from mental health issues. The difficulties I experienced during my stay in hospital were vast. \r\nI found the kitchen dirty and often lacked in supplies of milk. The toilets I used were filthy and often had cigarette stubs in them and rarely had toilet paper, paper towels and soap. This is no disrespect to the ward cleaner who constantly worked hard but the scale of the job was obviously too large for her alone. I found that some of the staff had very curt attitudes. I found there was complete chaos without the leadership of a particular doctor. It seemed as if the qualified nurses spent a high proportion of their time in their office, which made it difficult for patients to get the chance to discuss their problems with them and engage in therapeutic communication. If \u201cpaperwork\u201d is the excuse I would not accept this and consider it a waste of a trained nurse's salary- processes and systems need urgent review. I found it was virtually impossible to ever get to speak with a qualified nurse and even when they promised to come ASAP they rarely did, destroying confidence in any nurse/patient relationship. \r\nNo care plan seemed evident as I was not informed of any plan of treatment or what my role and the nurse's role would be in this. (I really don't think that any plan existed but if it did I would like to see a copy). I went into hospital as a voluntary patient as I was very ill not having slept for 3-4 weeks. I had confidence that I would be helped but feel as though I was just contained and given drugs. I feel very disappointed and let down by the ward. I was admitted one year ago and there seems to have been a dramatic deterioration in standards of care. I was upset at the lack of care and attention for other dependent patients too. \r\nI feel that I received no help with my problems except from one staff nurse who took the time to talk with me about my problems and showed a genuinely caring attitude. I saw no evidence that any of the staff had any knowledge of sleep difficulties and their management. For example, a night staff nurse was dangerously unaware that I was on a high dose of diazepam and wanted to dismiss me without it. He seemed to have absolutely no knowledge of the dangers of sudden cessation of diazepam (i.e. fits). During discussions with him I requested to speak to the night nurse manager whom he at first denied existed and later absolutely refused to contact for me. I feel he is an unsafe nurse and acted unprofessionally and I am considering reporting him to the NMC. I did by chance meet the nurse manager in the early hours of the morning and she said that she would instigate some retraining with him. If this has occurred, I would like to be informed of its progress. \r\nI was left lying in my bed for most of the 24hour period with barely any interaction with staff, no guidance on how to improve my situation etc. The bed was left unmade for days at a time as I was too depressed, demoralized and weak to make it. No one even seemed to notice and there were certainly no offers of help. \r\nI was quite fit when I entered the hospital; I was able to swim 70 lengths several times a week and spend 1.5 hours at the local gym and did lots of walking. There is nowhere on the ward to exercise and at times I became very agitated and would recourse to involuntary \u201cpacing\u201d for which I felt like I was being chastised. As previously mentioned I as a voluntary patient and yet on occasions when I requested to leave the ward this was refused. I therefore consider (backed by my MIND advocate) that I was illegally detained on the ward and will be taking further advice on this\r\n\r\n", "I was appalled and horrified at the way my father was treated at the accident and emergency department at Hairmyres hospital. My dad who always kept very well through all his years sadly passed away on the 24th March 2009 and I feel that I do not have anything to thank Hairmyres for. During 2006 between the months of April to August my dad was complaining of severe pain in his abdomen and a severely distended stomach. My mother and I took my father to the A&E department at Hairmyres where they did routine blood tests and x rays, nothing showed up therefore they discharged my father saying they could find anything wrong with him. This happened on at least 6 different occasions as over the following few months my father became worse, his back was agony and could barley walk some days. On each visit to A&E, not once was my father admitted to try and find out what was wrong with him. \r\n\r\nMy dads stomach was very badly distended and I knew something serious was wrong, we kept getting told that was normal and apparently nothing was visible in the x-ray so my dad was a \"mystery\" and could have \"unexplained pain\" - have you ever heard anything like this! My father was getting fed up going to hospital as he felt he was being made to feel a nuisance by the doctors. We asked why they would not admit him, they said no need yet. Drunks and drug addicts are admitted for help and people who have been in fights receive treatment, in my opinion the system is all wrong. My dad was in absolute agony over the months and we were getting nowhere, no one was helping us - it felt like banging your head off a brick wall. One doctor even told my father \u2018It's not cancer, if that's what you are thinking'. Well months later after diagnosing my father myself, not being a doctor, my dad was diagnosed with lymphoma cancer. \r\n\r\nI will never forgive the A&E department for their treatment towards my father. If my dad had been admitted and given a scan this would most likely have been picked up at least 10 months earlier, instead of being told he was just a mystery and to go home; no investigations were ever done. Our own doctor eventually got my father admitted and again he had x-rays and blood tests, nothing showed up. The doctor said there was no need for a scan as everything was normal. My poor father went through hell.\r\n\r\nEventually the mass became so big it snapped a disc in his spine. He was crawling on the floor in pain from back and stomach. The doctor who saw my father sent him home again and arranged for barium meal for 3 months time! Within a few weeks of my dad leaving the hospital he had lost a stone and a half. My mum called the doctors secretary, she was hysterical and pleading with her to bring my dads appointment forward. The doctor saw him on the Friday and as quick as that my dad had the CT scan on the Monday - why did this take numerous months and the begging of my mother to get this done? \r\n\r\nIn the end, it was too late. I wish now that I had put a complaint to Hairmyres about the A&E department but after my dad was diagnosed, all our energies went into the 2 and a half years of looking after him. I will never get over losing my dad and every day I think of how things could have been different if even one of the 7 doctors that saw my Dad had been more thorough. In my opinion, not one of them did their job properly. I only hope no one else has to go through this. I feel that the hospital did not treat my dad seriously enough, I am not a doctor yet I knew my Dad had lymphoma with his symptoms. I only wish it was not too late to put my complaint forward as I strongly believe that my Dad suffered serious neglect at Hairmyres.\r\n", "Afew years ago, I was taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Kings Lynn following a serious car crash that was not my fault . I was left in agony, not one panel was left undamaged on my car, which was stationary at the time. The force was so great that the truck in front moved and hit the van in front, writing the truck off. I was told by A&E to return the next day as the consultant on call was refusing to come in and I would not receive any treatment until the following day if they kept me in.\r\nI was severely injured, with facial injuries and was barely conscious, I could not fit into my shoes or clothes. I was in agony. I was told that I did not have a neck injury not even whiplash which was just impossible. I felt completed let down and ignored, the staff showed me and my mum no respect. \r\nTwo years later, an Arthroscopy was done at the Norfolk and Norwich hospital where they did the bare minimum, not even removing the splintered bone fragments or fluid in the joint. I was told that I had broken the wrist joint through three quarter of the circumference and crushed the other quarter, damaged the ligament beyond repair and would never be able to do my work again. I was retired which meant that left me having to sell my house and everything I had worked for since leaving school. I was thirty one years old and had always worked long hours like everyone else. I lost everything. My life completed changed. \r\nThrough the complaints that followed, I felt like I was branded a liar and everyone thought I was over exaggerating.\r\nI received no evidence and no compensation except for a minor injury equating to less than two years salary, seven years after the crash. I had not worked for the previous four years because the NHS would not sign me fit for work. My case was passed around from court to court, having being forced to pay all of the legal expenses and seven years later a court allowed my Solicitors to come off record supposedly for my own safety because of the threats they were making against me. I have had never-ending trouble and distress since the accident, especially in my dealings with the NHS. \r\nI became so isolated I was terrified to leave the house. The police were involved a few times but I was told that if I wanted all this to stop, I should drop the case.\r\nI have seen all the changes in the Complaints procedures over the years. On my third attempt, they agreed to take on my case but were in the middle of changing the system creating PALs. I feel this was useless and got me no where because by the time my complaint was made I was told it was too late and the NHS refused to accept it because it did not comply with their NHS time scales! Help!\r\nPALs had no authority to force them to comply.\r\nOver the years I have complained countless times, each time my official complaints were refused and as far as I am aware not recorded as complaints. \r\nI complained to the Ombudsman who concluded this was a sad case. Every time I tired to complain this was brought up, making me believe that I could do nothing. There was so much confusion about the treatment I had received following the accident and it all became very frustrating. \r\nI paid to see private doctors and was told by one consultant that I was over eager and that I must have looked up the symptoms to this injury so that I could claim compensation. I felt like the doctors were sticking up for each other. I had an arthroscopy done and some tests but it got to the point where I could take this treatment no further because I could not afford to, the insurance company refused to pay for this. The NHS said they had no legal obligation to follow the consultants recommendations for further treatment because he was not employed by them.\r\nI did not receive the benefits that I was legally entitled to - how did these people ever get so much power over my life?\r\nAll this because someone on that day with a string of previous driving convictions shoved my stationary car under a truck, and telephoned the AA to come and move my car because it was in his way!\r\nI complained and complained, never getting any answers to my questions. I only found out the name of my injury from a doctor who lost his temper with me one day - Lunotriquetral Dissociation. I could not find any information on this. \r\nI was still in so much pain. I had being prescribed Co Proaxamol and Ibuprofen for years but it did not touch the pain. I had constant headaches of the like I had never had prior to all of this. I was vomiting all day and all night from pain, getting one infection after another. I felt unwelcome at my GPs practice. One day out of the blue they decided to sign me fit for work and my new GP told me to go out and get a job, any job and work my way up. \r\nMy new doctor said I was so anaemic that if my blood dropped one more level it would be life threatening. I still take Coproaxamol and a different anti inflammatory. \r\nI moved to a small flat but the neighbours were unaccepting towards me and I feel that this was due to discrimination towards me as I was disabled. I was despairing and by this time totally depressed. I had given up speaking to anyone and did not bother speaking to the NHS because I felt like I would get more accusations.\r\nI had an appointment at Edith Cavell Hospital but they just did a compulsory x-ray which I knew would not really progress my treatment. \r\nI am now in touch with my local MP and hope that it will help. I feel like I am playing word games with the NHS, I don't feel listened to. \r\nI took my case to the Disability Rights Commission. The PCT were supposed to attend but instead sent two people from the Complaints department who said they were unable to address the issues that I was raising but agreed that I could receive a wrist splint. That was in 2005 and I won my case but in 2009 I am still waiting.\r\nThis injury is to my dominant left hand and I have to pay to have my car adapted to comply with the law just so that I can drive. The Government does not allow me any disability payments for this.\r\nThe last straw came last year when my GP told me that the consultant had said that I did not have a lunotriquetral dissociation. Although I was referred to the consultant in Norfolk by Cambridgeshire PCT, they have and continue to refuse to recognise the consultants diagnosis for the previous eleven years because they have not obligation to as he is not employed directly by them.\r\nI was so upset and in so much pain I decided to go back to the QEH for the first time since 1999. I went to A&E and was asked what the injury was and then told that with this injury they would not be able to treat me but I could wait and see if they will see me. So I waited and was reluctantly referred to the Orthopaedic clinic the next day to see the consultant who acted as the medical expert in the court case.\r\nThe consultant was the expert independent witness acting and had been quite nice to me and when the Government changed the legislation to help \"victims\", I felt that both parties manipulated this so that they could pick and choose everything from the old and new legislation that was in their best interests, not mine. \r\nI have since discovered that the expert medical witness was the same consultant that signed my paperwork, when I was taken by ambulance to the QEH i.e. the consultant who refused to come in and see me.\r\nEventually they told me to sit in a cubicle and I was there for another hour watching people come and go before me, I did notice that the medical staff had plenty of time and happily chatted away to these people answering all of their questions about their injuries.\r\nWhen I saw the consultant he looked at my hand and said he could do nothing because I needed to be referred to a hand specialist - something I had been asking for for the last nine years since I learnt about them and refused this for nine years. I asked him to refer me to one but he refused saying he was not allowed to. I explained to him as a I had been saying all of these years that they are not allowed to refuse me the treatment that I am legally entitled to. The consultant left and I thought he was going to discuss it with a colleague but he did not come back.\r\nEventually I decided to go and ask at the reception desk but she was busy. I managed to catch a nice nurse, and told her that I was going out to put another ticket on my car because my parking had run out and I did not want to get a parking ticket, she just shook her head and walked off. I could not understand what was going on and was very nervous and upset by now. I was about to leave when the consultant approached me. Before I could turn around to leave because I really did not like the look of this, he had took me back into the cubicle and seemed furious, saying that he did not have time for this or me and that he had being pulled out of clinic. \r\nI reminded him that in my opinion, my hand and wrist is in this state because the consultant (who I thought was him) refused to come in and treat me. I had been waiting for more years than anyone here today and surely I deserved some time and an explanation as to why this hospital had been funded for treating my injuries when I had received no treatment for the last twelve years and why I was still being refused treatment. He said he had set my wrist and that it had healed quite well for the serious injury that it was. I reminded him that no one had set my wrist , that it was stuck in a temporary wrist cast for three weeks and six days before it was removed and I was told to \u2018Tubi grip' it and that the pain was worse now than when the injury occurred. I reminded him that he told me that the injury was a minor injury which would heal for two years. I showed him the state of my hand and explained that I now had little feeling in my fingers and insisted that I be referred to a hand specialist. \r\nHe walked over to the door and yelled for security. I stood still, in the middle of the room where I was and did not know what to do but I knew I would make sure not to go near any of the staff or try to push past them in case they tried to claim that I had done anything wrong. \r\nI just wanted to burst into tears and leave but I could do neither, by this time he and three nurses were stood in the doorway blocking my only exit and threatening to call the police.\r\nEventually I was told by a nurse who I'd met on a previous occasion she would sort it out. She blocked the doorway which I could not believe.\r\nShe left the doorway to walk to the other side to phone for security, so I could now safely walk over to the locked door to leave. I managed to open the locked door which I was not sure I would be able to do, as I now have difficulty with such tasks, and simply left.\r\nI wanted to phone the Police but did not know what to do. This time I was determined to have a complaint accepted. The hospital registered my complaint. They claimed that I had been referred to the wrong department but I was refused a referral to a hand specialist and received no explanation or apology.\r\nI insisted on seeing my notes and was allowed back in to the hospital supervised by the new litigation manager. I was told that only if they were found to be negligent could I receive treatment at this hospital. I felt like if only these people understood my situation and experienced the same as I did then they would act differently. \r\nEvery day is agony. I think about the accident all the time and wish it hadn't happened. \r\nThe driver was charged with careless driving. I do not want revenge just justice. I am disabled now and he was never charged with the physical injuries he caused me which I believe now that he should have been. I had never been in hospital up to that point apart from when I was born, I was 31years old. \r\nI have discovered that every few years they like to do a few tests, but refuse always to tell my why, bullyig me into going on the false hope that this time they are finally going to do something, and then as soon as they do the tests dump faster than you can blink until they do the same again in a few years. As one GP put it, it is been seen to be doing something when you have no intnetion of doing anything!!!\r\nI have been given various drugs, xrays and scans since the accident and have seen so many different specialists and consultants but my injuries have never properly been treated in my opinion. \r\nIs it to much to ask for a splint that is dark in colour that does not show the dirt, is comfortable and wearable, and washable and is replaced regularly so it is not perceived as unhygienic and disgusting by people. I have not been able to afford to replace my splints regularly due to the cost of them. I cannot simply stand the pain of keeping my hand in the correct position all day in a splint, it is too painful, as this thirteen years on, is a bit late. The NHS claim this will relieve my pain but in my experience it hasn't and if they have really changed as they claim, they should listen and pay attention to what I am saying. I believe they are following their own agenda which I now believe is the White Paper Published in 2004 to be implemented in April 2009 for people with long term injuries. I was told out of the blue that I am being offered a pain management programme funnily enough also mentioned in this paper for which this PCT has received funding for this for me for the last five years, so why now?\r\nI have been asking to be referred to a pain clinic for as long as I have been asking to be referred to a hand specialist with the appropriate funding and permission from the PCT to allow me to have the treatment for this injury so that I can continue with my life as I would have done had I received the appropriate treatment all those years ago.\r\nThe health service ombudsman finally agreed to look into my complaint again but the system has changed. I then had to contact the Healthcare Commission and put my complaint through them before I could put it once again to the Health Service Ombudsman. The health care commission said I would have to follow the NHS procedure again as they cannot look at such old complaints. This is where the Disability Rights Commission got involved. \r\nBack and forth to the healthcare commission who finally agreed to look at my case if I can get it all down on paper, and I explained that this will take me time as there is thirteen years worth and I have difficulty writing and typing as this causes further deterioration of the injury.\r\nI tried to complain to them recently to be told they cannot accept my recent complaint because they no longer exist and now I have to contact the health service Ombudsman as they have now taken over from the Health Service Commission and the e-mail address I was given is not responding. Deja vu I think, given up and fed up!\r\nI resent being forced to contribute to this service through my taxes.\r\nI know that people think that the NHS should not be given bad publicity because it takes away from the staff who do a good job, and there are good medical staff out there, indeed I work with some. However, surely the NHS should treat people better than this, what if this was you and your life? It seems to me that they have never placed any value on my quality of life.\r\nIt would be easier and quicker for me to write a book because what I have written tonight barely touches on what has actually happened. I am glad that at least part of the story is out now. \r\nNobody expects the NHS to get it right all of the time but it is what they do and when they make a mistake that makes a real difference to peoples lives they should make reparations. I can barely straighten both my arms, they are so painful. I am left with damaged muscles in my leg which I am unable to control and they move on their own. I cannot raise my foot properly and I fall over which is utterly embarrassing in the street. My neck was damaged, I have scars all over and these have never been diagnosed. \r\nI have long since given up asking about this because I feel the response is so hostile . Everything I have said is true but I have left out a lot of details due to the length of time that has passed and the amount that this covers. This is not intended to be inflammatory or offensive to anyone and is intended to show my experience of the NHS which unfortunately is not good to say the least.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "My mother has Parkinsons.  She had a fall some weeks ago.  My mother moved to Extra Care Housing last August which has been a life saver.  Her carers are on site 24 hours a day.  \r\nWhen my mother fell she badly grazed her arm and the carers called an ambulance and my mother was taken to Kingston Hospital to be checked and assessed.   Initially on their assessment ward, which despite being manic and very busy, seemed to run well.  She was then transferred to a ward.  Again everything was fine.  Staff were kind and helpful and aware.  \r\nMy mother was then transferred to Roehampton Hospital to the Mary Seacole rehabilitation ward - to maximise her mobility - she was to stay for two weeks. During this time family and friends watched my mother deteriorate.  The ward is brand new - large bays - staff allocated to each bay etc.  My mother was to have physiotherapy and we thought she would be encouraged to move as much as possible in order to speed recovery.  Unfortunately apart from when she was taken for physio she and other patients, from what I can tell, remained in bed or sitting by their beds with no seemingly stimulation, no activity, no conversation, no television - nothing.  It was as if they were all waiting for the end.  \r\nSome of the staff were lovely.  Others, I believe, should question why they are there. I often saw tea being delivered in silence - no hello - no addressing patients by name. I watched with great sadness as my mother tried to catch the womens eye and say hello but either the nurse was paying no attention or ignored her.  \r\nI discovered a lovely dining room - but I never saw any patient being taken in there - surely a place where patients could be taken to enjoy a social interaction whilst having their meals. This to me would have been rehabilitation. Encouraged/helped to a day lounge to see others etc. \r\nThere was another lady at the other end of the bay that my mother could have chatted to - but they were never moved near each other.  \r\nWe were all so concerned at the deterioration of my mother during this stay so I requested her discharge.  You want to trust doctors and professionals to be doing the best for those you love but I fear that was not the case. \r\nI discovered her medication had been reduced with no explanation, which meant that she was not on full power. She was also being given her meds 6 hourly as opposed to 4 hourly as she was used to. On discharg, her medication was not correct this has taken a week to sort out.  Still no explanation from doctor at hospital about why he reduced her medication. \r\nNow back home, her carers are shocked at how she has changed in the three weeks she has been away.  She is now very vulnerable and at serious risk of another fall.  All this for a graze on her arm.  \r\nI also watched what I considered to be abuse by a member of staff to the lady in the next bed.  The member of staff seemed to delight in tormenting this poor lady. I feel that the patients were not shown the respect and dignity that they deserve.  We will all one day be elderly and I don't want to have to expect treatment like this. ", "A number of family members expressed concerns to me about how and why my dad died at Whiston Hospital and questioned why the cause of his death was not dealt with earlier \u2013 it was something I too had wondered about, and even his GP expressed surprise about the eventual/apparent cause of his death.\r\nHe was very defensive of his consultant whenever I questioned him about his apparent lack of treatment. However, following his death I was surprised to find he had kept a diary of his appointments - and from reading this I can now see his own frustration at the lack of diagnosis. He had even started writing a letter of complaint to his specialist about his lack of treatment after being discharged from Whiston following his first stay.\r\nOne of my primary concerns following his death was why it took an inordinate amount of time to diagnose and treat the apparent cause of his jaundice \u2013 this included three periods in the hospital, and only after he had lost two to three stones in weight and was so weak he could not resist or fight the fatal infections (potentially caused by the stent or its insertion) \u2013 and being literally on his death-bed, was he and our family informed a cancer had been identified.\r\nDuring each of his stays at Whiston Hospital, his condition deteriorated whilst he was awaiting treatment. I still do not understand why identification and treatment of his condition was not treated with increased priority, bearing in mind the hospital were aware of the pattern of deterioration and infection (sepsis) which occurred each time he was admitted, nor do I understand why he was not prescribed broad-spectrum antibiotics before invasive procedures were carried out.\r\nNOTHING CAN BRING HIM BACK NOW  but I remain concerned about the way he was treated. I would like to know why it took so many ERCPs, ultrasounds and biopsies to identify a cancer. My father recovered from his first stay at Whiston Hospital and the day after he returned home his GP diagnosed him as suffering from impetigo and anemia \u2013 why wasn't this diagnosed and treated in the hospital?\r\nIn the five days before he died he ate a small ice cream and two small jelly's - and had a few sips of water coupled with a saline drip. I asked why he wasn't being given nutritional support and was informed \u201chis sugar and calorific levels are being monitored he won't starve\u201d. My father was diabetic, clearly deteriorating and could not eat and I still do not understand why he wasn't given nutritional support. \r\nDad's \u2018cancer' was diagnosed a few days before his death. The doctor explained it was very small, this was why it had not been not been detected in the ultra sound, CT scans or ERCP examinations. A day later without further examination a second doctor described it as \u201cflorid and obviously aggressive\u201d.\r\nI am concerned that Whiston Hospital did not anticipate the likelihood of an infection or respond quickly enough when it occurred. My fathers decline was due to avoidable infections rather than due to the cancer but I suspect cancer was seen to be a more convenient diagnosis and acceptable reason for his death.\r\nWould quick decisive diagnosis and treatment have saved my dad's life? \r\n\r\n", "I am 23 years of age and I was referred to Dudhope House at the age of 14 due to personal reasons.\r\nI can honestly say that my experience there was the worst I've ever encountered. I found some of the staff at Dudhope took liberties in their professions, and on many occasions I was personally victimised, insulted and made to feel worthless.\r\nAfter a year at Dudhope I was discharged, and I personally believe my time there did me a lot more harm than good.\r\nOne psychiatrist I met I felt almost tore my family apart, due to certain remarks they made about my father during family sessions - which were completely and absolutely false. Some of the negative comments that were made about my family and me have stayed with me to this day.\r\nBut I will never let my memories of that \"hellhole\" get the better of me - I just hope that no other teenager anywhere has to go through what I did.", "I recently had a hip operation at Stepping hill hospital, and I found the entire ordeal frightening.\r\nThe operation went fine, but once back on the ward all but a few nurses did not seem to care, I was left lying flat and when given food and drink they wondered why I was not taking it.\r\nI asked to be sat up but all I got was a negative response saying I would only slip down again.\r\nI now understand I should have started some form of exercising, But I was not told to do or given any.\r\nWhen I left a week later I was not given ANY instruction about exercising of any type, it took my son to get some printed of the internet if I am doing them right who knows and who cares? certainly not SSH\r\nThis experience has left me worrying and hoping I do not have to have my other hip done.\r\n", "Where to start? My mother, a formidable and highly intelligent 88 year old, unfortunately, admitted to Weston General as a precaution. Unusually, we found her reluctant to use her buzzer (when it was within her reach!) to call for assistance and wondered why. We soon found out. Whenever the family approached staff members with concerns or questions, apart from two occasions, the responses varied between total disinterest and borderline hostility.\r\nMy mother died 10 days after admission and, for reasons that I will not go into here, we requested a copy of her medical records.  These records merely added to our distress in that they showed:\r\nMissed and late medication; Insufficiency of fluid intake; Failure to bleep doctors when required; Insufficient nutrition (we have been told since that high energy drinks may not have been prescribed because of the cost); Lack of cannula care; Cannula left in place for 48 hours too long; Failure to adequately assess mobility; Failure to reassess risk of malnutrition; Failure to address nausea; Failure to complete a full falls assessment; Failure to chase crucial test results; Failure to adequately manage diabetes (including a number of missed insulin doses).\r\nI could go on - but not without discussing matters that would be just too personal for my mother.\r\nAdd to the above the fact that we had to address one problem or another at almost every visitng time and I am sure you will get the picture.\r\nThe interaction we witnessed between the nursing staff and my mother was, at best, patronising and, at worst, curt. Communication with the family was abysmal to say the least.\r\nMy sister and I have since, on two occasions, met with a Matron and the Ward Sister. I have to say, we encountered an attitude that almost mirrored that of their staff - patronising, evasive and hostile. We still do not know precisely what happened to our mother during her final hours. The medical records do not tell us and the staff either cannot or will not say.", "just after Easter I visited my GP (who claims to be a GP with Special Interest in Dermatology and who I think gives advice to other GPs in the practice about skin problems) as I had a dark red blemish on the inside of my right upper arm. The GP looked at this and said it was nothing to worry about, it was a kind of blood blister and would put me on to the minor ops list to shave the blemish off.\r\n\r\nI heard nothing more about this anticipated procedure.\r\n\r\n3 weeks later the 'blemish' had grown more lumpy and started to bleed so i revisited the GP - who was visibly shocked and told me to attend the emergency dermatology clinic at the hospital the next day. At the clinic the clinicians ( a Dermatologist, CNS and Consultant plastic surgeon) who saw my 'blemish' were very surprised that a GP had missed such a malignant melanoma!\r\n\r\nI later found out the GP was not accredited as a GPwSI and am left wondering just how many people are misdiagnosed with a potentially life threatening diagnosis - surely the NHS must ensure that all suspected skin lesions are seen by a Consultant Dermatologist?", "My dad has cancer, he has been in and out of hospital on numerous occasions and I continue to despair at inadequacies that put people's lives at risk that needn't be there.  Dad was in a side room, having had major surgery, when I visited, you could see the lines of dirt where the cleaners had mopped around things, e.g. the bin - under the foot bar was filthy.  \r\n\r\nDad also woke in the middle of the night of his operation and, disorientated, he tried to get out of bed.  He stumbled and fell across the room.  He said he kept calling but no one came.  When he eventually managed to drag himself back to bed, he pressed his buzzer and when no one still came, he resorted to throwing a jug of water across the room at the wall.  Eventually a nurse appeared.  There's no need for this, someone in clear pain that just needs checking on once in a while, this didn't seem to be happening.  \r\n\r\nDad asked one of the nurses to clear some pots off his bed table and was told she wasn't allowed to as it wasn't her job.  \r\n\r\nI appreciate that the nursing staff do the best they can but my dad's experience isn't good enough.  People come to hospital to be cared for, it upset me that dad had fallen and been left on the floor to fend for himself, this is a man who fought for years in the British forces, continually blown up for his country and a few of the nurses who cared for my dad didn't check on him or to give him a wash and change his bed clothes.\r\n\r\nDad was moved to a private hospital where the attitude was totally different and pro active.  Nothing was too much trouble for the nurses and they spent the time at night to sit with him for a while when he couldn't sleep so he wasn't alone.  That is what nursing is all about.\r\n", "We are concerned and sorry to read about your experience and would welcome the opportunity to discuss your experience in total confidence with you.\r\nPlease can we encourage you to contact our confidential Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS) helpline on 0121 424 0929 between the hours of 9am \u2013 5pm Monday to Friday where a trained member of the team will be waiting to take your call.\r\nThank you.", "Our son entered Good Hope Hospital last September aged 18 and just about to go to uni. He had high temperature which they gave him painkillers for, and we were told any sign of blood had to be reported urgently. Once this was done I felt they did not take a lot of notice, and by now he was being sick. \r\n\r\nI met the consultant once. He walked past me and said \u2018he's a mystery' about my son and that was the last time I saw him in the seven days our son was there. When we complained about it all afterwards the consultant claimed that he was in contact with us at all times; which was totally untrue. My husband never met him.\r\n\r\nMy son was put in a side room and everyone was supposed to wear aprons but often this didn't happen. If it had not been for the next weekend staff he would have still been there. Our son had to be transferred to Addenbrooke's because there were no intensive care beds.\r\n\r\nHe eventually died and we feel it was partly due to the care he had. The arrogant consultant gave the impression he thought he was better than everyone else. We feel our son was let down. He may not have survived but we will never know.\r\n\r\nWe believe that if the consultant had looked at other areas he would have been able to see what was wrong and there is a protocol for what our son had.

My brother is thin, lean and quite fit but there was a blockage which caused this. He was sent to the Golden Jubilee Hospital Glasgow who were fantastic and really great with giving us information of what they were doing and what to expect. He was then transferred the next day to Glasgow Royal Infirmary ward 44 Coronary Care Unit (CCU). He was there for 3 days and in those three days I felt we were not given any information of what was happening or what to do next. My brother also came out in a rash; this rash seemed to be where each of the pads was placed on his body. We did ask about this rash but were advised that it should clear on its own in time. My brother got discharged on Saturday the 8th and was advised to follow his patient handbook. \r\nOn Thursday the 13th August my brother was suffering from major pains in chest again, the ambulance men asked my sister in law for paperwork to prove what she had informed them of his condition. I can understand this due to his age but I don't think it seemed to be a very professional process. While my brother was taken into A&E we waited in waiting room. We waited for an hour and half before someone came and allowed my sister in law in to see him. My brother told her that a nurse had advised him the rash that he had was in fact scabies.  I felt that this was not the case as I didn't think it looked like scabies as I thought the usual place is between fingers. \r\nAfter the nurse had said this my brother explained the rash only came after the pads had come into contact with his body. My brother felt that this comment was not registered by the medical staff as they then proceeded to stay away from him except when doctor came who then scrubbed his arms as though he had just completed surgery. My brother had also visited our own GP in regards to this who had advised that it seemed like reaction to either meds or pads and had prescribed cream. My brother who was already in stressed situation now was very anxious. We did eventually get told he would be kept in and go back to ward 44 in CCU. \r\nAfter settling him in bed they allowed us in but when we went to see him he told us he was really stressed. I believe the reason for this was that he felt the nurses had not aided him into bed and would not go near him without wearing big gloves and aprons. I do understand why they do this but explaining this to him would have probably calmed him down. My brother then proceeded to say he would be better off leaving and going home. The nurse in attendance who heard him say this then went and informed doctor on duty. The doctor came in to discuss this and explained about how fatal it could be for him by leaving. While she advised this I felt she was continually looking at his arms but we had advised previous nurse of reason he was upset. \r\nWhen my brother said again that he had been made to feel like he had a  disease, the doctor then said he could go if he wanted but first a letter had to be signed and then walked away to get form. I believe the stress that my brother's heart was now under was major. We then had another nurse advise us that she had plenty of patients that needed and wanted help. We then left at around 5am. On the following Saturday my brother went to the doctor's drop in centre for the rash as the itching was unbearable. He was given a cream and tablets as doctor again advised reaction to something. By Monday the rash had died down with the cream and tablets a great deal. On Monday morning I went to pick up my brother to take him to a booked doctor's appointment but when I saw him he was a ghastly colour. The doctor then advised he should get to hospital asap. When we arrived at Glasgow Royal we again waited while my brother was taken in to be assessed.\r\nWe waited for 2 hours before we looked around and saw my brother come out half naked. I think he looked worse than when he went in and looking even more ill. He shouted that we had to take him out of hospital now and take him elsewhere as he was upset with the nurse. We took him outside where he sat on pavement getting his clothes back on. I went to reception to ask for letter that doctor had sent us with. I approached a window but just as I did someone came to speak to receptionist from behind her and she then got up and walked away. I went to 2nd window and girl was typing something on computer. I asked her calmly that I need to get this letter now so I can take my brother to another hospital. The girl asked me to wait 2 minutes and she would go get it. I accepted this and proceeded to turn and advise my sister in law it would be 2 minutes.\r\nI turned back and the receptionist I spoke to was in corner at filing cabinet laughing with another colleague and looking through notes. I thought this was not my brother's notes as I believe they were in next room. I then asked if someone could get my brother's letter as he was in middle of collapsing outside and needed help. The receptionist who I thought was ignoring previously then shouted, \"Aye ok can you not see we are busy, you will just have to wait.\" I advised her that the girl said she would go straight through and get it but she hadn't. I thought these girls and all the patients had seen the state of my brother. The police then came over and asked me to not be cheeky to the receptionists as they were doing their job. I informed them the state of my brother who was outside then the doctor came out and asked to see me. I asked him to give me the letter and he refused. \r\nI asked again for the letter but he still refused stating he was not giving me the letter as my brother needed help. I shouted for my sister in law to bring my brother in as they were refusing to give me the letter. We then found out from my brother that the reason he wanted to leave was that one of the nurses who was on duty on Thurs night had commented that he had been in but signed himself out and that it was his own fault he was back in. I think this comment to my brother whilst he had been feeling ill and also his experience from Thursday night had made the situation spiral out of control. My brother then became involved in an argument with this particular nurse because of the comment she supposedly made. \r\nI felt his questions were not answered as when he asked for her name he was ignored by other staff and the nurse then took off her badge and placed this in a drawer. She did eventually state her name but we don't think this was her real name as that was name of building. When this incident first happened my brother had also asked during the 2 hours if he could get his wife in and although he was advised we will get her in a minute, no one ever came and requested her attendance. My brother was then allowed to leave as the doctor who was in fact really nice to us did eventually give us the letter back from the other doctor. We then had to rush back to our GP to request a further letter to go to Stobhill Hospital A&E. By now we believe my brother had been suffering from another heart attack for around 3 hours with no medical assistance. We got a letter for Stobhill and had to wait a further 2 hours before being seen but my brother was now looking really bad but was now calm. The staff there could not have been any nicer to us even though we did explain why we had been sent there.\r\nAfter the doctor had seen my brother he was admitted which my brother agreed to. When I saw him again before going he was on oxygen, his heart rate was 60 on the machine and blood pressure was extremely low. The staff could not comment on our experience on Thursday and Monday but did say there is always a professional way to respond to someone in distress and in process of a heart attack. I think the result of all this now means that my brother has so much damage to his heart. I think he is in great risk and maybe next time he could die. Although this weekend has been so bad for us, we think as a family the staff from cleaners to consultants could not have been more genuinely sincere, caring and informative at Stobhill. We have come away understanding more about what he has to do and what we have to do to support him. They also gave us a letter to give to the housing association as at present they live in top floor tenement with their 2 kids aged 6 and 11. I cannot thank them enough for helping my family but I don't think we will ever deal with Glasgow Royal again. \r\n", "I was admitted to Southport DGH in early November 2008, aged 67, suffering from MS; acute sciatica; pneumonia; urinary tract infection. I could walk only with the aid of a stick, my balance being very poor. My Falls Assessment, described me as \"Fully Mobile\", which I feel was incorrect.It did not appear that the staff had read my file properly. I believe that he medication prescribed and administered to me was inappropriate, causing undesirable side effects, some of which are extant. The nursing staff I saw did not live up to the standard to which the Trust lays claim. From what I saw calls for help from bed-bound patients were rarely answered. When I asked the lady in the bed next to mine why no-one complained about this to the senior staff, she said it was because they feared retaliation.I was roughly treated myself, and physically assaulted by one nurse in particular.I came out of that hospital far more ill than when I went in.I have, via my GP, requested the ambulance services never to take me to that hospital again. I made a formal complaint to the hospital. It took several weeks even to obtain copies of my medical records from them. It took them a further 3 months to respond to my complaints.I was on Ward 7B.I would like \"funky\" who has also written her [story](https://www.patientopinion.org.uk/opinion.aspx?opinionID=18514) on this page, to let it be known which ward she was on!!!", "My mother died in Pilgrims Hospital from acute cholangitis which is a bacterial infection of the Biliary tree,it could have been cured.\r\nThe first signs of the illness was August 2008 when the doctors found air in the Biliary canal, instead of performing surgery they sent my Mum home with some story that I didn't understand.\r\nSince that date my Mum suffered continuous pain and was sent from doctor to doctor and not one of them followed up the original problem until 3 days before she died and even then the correct medicine was not prescribed! it took 2 days to get a CT scan! which by now was to late,my Mum was in so much pain the night before she died the staff moved her bed closer to the nurses station on the ward so they could keep a closer eye on her,somehow during the night my Mum tried to climb out of her bed and fell to the floor with a serious head injury which in our opinion may have caused her heart to stop, resulting in her death.\r\nOur family are taking this further as you can imagine we are all so very angry with the doctors in the health service in Lincolnshire ", "I feel my mother was left starving and dehydrated in North Tees General Hospital.  Sadly my mother passed away 3 days after being admitted to North Tees Hospital.\r\nWhen I complained about her care I was firstly told she was on \"nil by mouth\" and when challenged they didn't actually know if she was or not - it turned out she wasn't which meant that she could have been given food and water but was denied it.\r\nWhen I visited she begged me for a drink - it was heartbreaking.\r\nThe replies to my letters of compaint were ridiculous. All they kept repeating was \"I am sorry if this was not explained to you at the time\".\r\nWhat I feel is missing here is basic nursing care. After receiving 2 inadequate replies to my letters I find it too upsetting to deal with the hospital and am going to take it higher.\r\nWhen I asked for my mother's hospital notes they told me I wasn't my mother's next of kin - but guess who they rang to tell me she had died?", "I went for a CT scan today and was unable to proceed with the CT scan due to severe claustrophobia.\r\nI asked to stop the procedure before it started, to not waste the unit's precious time. A consultant came to see me and I was basically bullied - told I had \"a serious attitude problem\" and then he said: \"Well just die young then\" and he walked out.\r\nI was there today as I may have a tumour. One of the symptoms of the tumour is high blood pressure and claustrophobia. I left today in tears having been told by a unsympathetic consultant who is being paid a lot of money to \"go home and die\".\r\nI am making a formal complaint for one simple reason: that I don't want anyone else going through the trauma I have been through today.", "I made a complaint today to my consultant, regarding a procedure 3 weeks ago that I feel  has made my condition worse, after which they say I now don't need an operation but will need to be on painkillers for the rest of my life, I am only 30. In my opinion I could see and hear in his tone of voice change after I complained. \r\n\r\nThe rest of the treatment was agreed last week, now its all changed, have not even had another scan before he changed his mind. He even agreed before I complained that the symptoms were not normal\r\n\r\nI can't go through the rest of my life in this much pain.\r\n\r\nFrom my experience the NHS should be closed and opened to the private sector. From my experience, Reading hospital is a complete disgrace, from the level of care to the state of the hygiene.\r\n\r\nI have just read the scores for the trust and they make me laugh; the areas I have seen of the hospital were dirty.\r\n", "At 22 pm on the Thursday my 87 yr old dad complained of severe abdominal pain and nausea, he had a golf ball size swelling in his groin.

At 7am he was hurting and it took 35 minutes for pain med. At 8 am another surgeon came and said he needed emergency surgery and they would soon work him in. \r\n\r\nDuring the day he was bumped back and went to surgery at 2200 on the Friday. The hernia was now almost 3 inches long and rock hard. At surgery, because of the strangulation, he had to have a resection of his bowel.

I've chased staff for dry IVs, pain med etc. \r\n\r\nI worked in the USA for 27 years and always bragged on the NHS, now I'm horrified; 5 hrs to see the doc and 15 hrs after he was declared as needing' emergency' surgery.\r\n", "I recently gave birth to my first child in Ormskirk Hospital. I felt I was subjected to horrible inpatient treatment from the moment I presented myself at hospital. \r\nI was told upon initial arrival that I was not in labour \u2013 but upon inspection I was over 6cm \u2013 but received no apology from the rude elder woman, who clearly thought she knew best. The midwife I was left with then proceeded to patronise my partner, mother and myself and spoke down to us.\r\nI had two people with me during my labour and during which my mother was tired and getting really distressed about the situation \u2013 which the staff dismissed and were so ignorant over. I requested that my mother leave and my brother come in \u2013 this was not allowed and the consultant and midwives caring for me were very rude about.\r\nI later found out that swapping partners is allowed in other hospitals, and not only that, I have spoken to a nurse at hospital that said it's a patient's right to switch out partners and that the hospital should not have been so bossy.\r\nI was struggling for hours upon hours to deliver my son \u2013 and it took my mother demanding to see another consultant for them to take me into theatre to be sliced and diced. The consultant also told my mother, partner and me that I should have had assistance hours ago \u2013 instead I was left in pain and made to keep pushing when my son was unable to be born without help.\r\nWhen I was moved down to post-natal, upon arrival on the new ward the duty nurse responded to my chart with \u2018oh I heard about you, and your mother'. Now to me that's inappropriate in any setting, but under the circumstance the last thing a new mother (stitched to high heaven) needs is rude staff.\r\nThe rest of my day didn't go any better.

However I had to return during the same week about the same issue numerous times, and once I waited 4 hours to be seen. I thought my injury was minor and treatable at the Walk-in as I had an insect bite and a swollen foot. \r\nI am very disgusted by the Walk In Centre Harlow because the antibiotics I was given first were correct but such a low dosage it had no effect (this is what I was advised by the Princess Alexandra Hospital).\r\nWhen I returned because my foot had swollen so much I could barely walk on it, they gave me water tablets. I have been advised these harmed my health as I was only 18 at the time, and they are for elderly patients. It ruined my electrolyte system and I have to take potassium supplements because a nurse prescribed me with the wrong medication.\r\nI was unaware of this at the time and came back as my foot got worse. I was prescribed another form of antibiotics, luckily i got seen straight away as I was making such a fuss, i could feel the skin on my foot burning with itchiness and begged for a lotion to fix it. They gave me a prescription for the antibiotics which i took for a day.\r\nThe next day I decided to go to A and E because I couldn't bear it anymore and was told I had extreme cellulitus and had been given completely the wrong medication from the Walk In Centre Harlow, and I was now at risk of need of an operation as my flesh and muscle in the foot may be dead. I was advised to be prepared for the worst and in some cases amputation may be needed.\r\nI was furious! I was given the wrong medication from the nurses at the Walk In and returned 3 times in pain and was advised it would soon be ok and was given crutches.\r\nOn my 3rd visit in the consultation room I was told to wait by the nurse while she was on the computer finishing with the last patient and she didn't even touch or examine my foot but simply prescribed me the wrong antibiotics.\r\nI hope this review will help others.\r\n\r\n", "I was referred to a neurologist at Queen's Hospital in 2007.  My husband and I feel he misled us into thinking he was going to help me with my pain symptoms (mainly severe head pain, arm numbness along with generally feeling unwell).  He seemed pleasant enough at the consultation and reassured us he would get to the bottom of things.  A few days later (he and I were conversing via e-mail) I started to get the impression that something was not right.  In actual fact this gentleman had discharged me even before he got the results of the blood test(s) back with no further tests.  \r\nI accused him of misleading me and he then caused me extra problems by writing to my GP and others, stating that I had a somatisation disorder and needed psychiatric help.  This had an effect on my future care with other neurologists as they were very dismissive of my symptoms.  I ended up having 2 strokes within 1year to 18 months after this and being diagnosed with a blood clotting disorder whereby I have to take anti-clotting drugs for life.  The condition I have has many other symptoms, but covers all the symptoms that were relayed to him.   \r\nI have made complaints about this but have been blanked by the board.

We were informed that the procedure was straightforward and he would be admitted as an in patient for 24 to 48 hours.  He was initially admitted to the Assessment Unit and an x-ray confirmed fluid on his lungs.  We were informed that this was not an emergency and the procedure would be performed that evening or the next morning.\r\n\r\nThe next day at 5pm he was transferred to a ward.   We were then informed that all the Doctors had retired for the day and the procedure would be performed the following morning.  Once again, we were informed that the procedure was not urgent.  \r\n\r\nWhen my mother and I returned from the restaurant to find that my father had been transferred to a ward (without notice) we proceeded to find the ward.  On arrival I felt we were met by an extremely hostile and rude sister who informed us that we shouldn't be visiting at that time.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards another nurse came to assess my father and when he was unable to hear her (Dad was hearing impaired) she had to ask us if my father was confused.  My Dad was present during this and very concerned that he was being treated in this way.\r\n\r\nThe procedure was not performed on that morning as agreed.  We were then approached by another Doctor who suggested that Dad have an ultra sound first.  Ultra sound performed -four hours later procedure still not performed.  We were informed again that Dad was not an emergency.  The procedure was eventually performed late that afternoon.\r\n\r\nDuring this period I believe Dad was not monitored properly, or provided with enough fluids and food. I think the care he received was beyond words.\r\n\r\nWhen we left Dad that evening he seemed stable to me.  My Mum was extremely upset and said to the night nurse \"please take care of him he is very precious\"  to which this person replied \"husbands are precious you are lucky to have one mine died a year ago\".  This statement made me feel concerned. \r\n\r\nWe returned the next morning to find that Dad's bed had been moved.  On asking the Consultant why he informed us that there was a \"mad man\" on the ward and they had moved Dad for peace and quiet.\r\n\r\nOn speaking to the Consultant he informed me that his x-ray had shown a small area of white consolidation - \"it could be cancer it could be something else but it didn't matter either way\" because the Oncologist had informed him that he would not provide Dad with any chemotherapy.  During the same conversation I asked the Consultant for some anti-biotics as a preventative measure (i.e. to prevent infection from draining) and was informed that this was not standard procedure and would not be undertaken.  He then went on to inform me that Dad had developed other conditions whilst in hospital and he would prefer me to sign the DNR (do not resuscitate) form - to which I refused.  When I refused he talked to my Mum and this went on all day long.\r\n\r\nOn that afternoon, we were approached by another Doctor who informed us that Dad had a severe infection and antibiotics were being commenced immediately.  It was then what seemed to me hours later they were administered.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning (early hours) we telephoned to check on Dad and we were informed that he was improving.  Shortly afterwards we received a call from the hospital.  On arrival we found Dad on a ventilator.  I was called away from Dads bed again and asked to sign the DNR form - to which I refused.  My mother was then called away.  This continued for hours and hours.  My Dad was placed on the Liverpool pathway but in my opinion we were not informed.  The Doctor informed my mother and brother that he would administer a pain killer and after twenty minutes Dad would be comfortable enough to switch off the ventilator. I don't think either of them was informed that this would result in Dad stopping breathing. Luckily I feel when the nurses arrived to do the same I was able to stop them.\r\n\r\nDad passed away on that afternoon and I feel the care, respect and dignity he received from those treating him was inhumane to say the least.\r\n\r\nThis is just a brief summary of the events. \r\n\r\nWe have requested Dad's notes and the hospital have only provided some.  I have telephoned the hospital on numerous occasions but telephone calls are never returned.  I have been promised telephone calls from the Chief Executive but not returned.\r\n\r\nReferring back to my conversation with the Consultant on Friday - Dad's notes (those I have) state that the white area x-ray could have been infection but he was refusing antibiotics. The notes also state he should perform a CT scan but saw no need as it wouldn't change the plan of treatment.  I want to question exactly what is going on in this hospital and ward.\r\n", "My dad was 89 years old. He has been health free most of his life, but had a small heart attack in 2005. Upon investigation they found he had an old aneurysm. In July 2007 my dad was treated for a blood clot at Peterborough hospital, which he got over and still enjoyed life. In November 2007 he had severe chest pains and was admitted as an emergency to Peterborough hospital where he was admitted for the night. I thought he looked awful as his stomach was distended he was clammy and it seemed to me clearly in pain. I was very relieved dad was in good hands at this time. The next morning I went to the hospital as they rang and said my dad could be discharged. I picked him up, and was told he was in the waiting room. He still looked awful I thought and one of the nurses told me there is nothing wrong with your dad, he has just got indigestion. That weekend was like hell for us as I felt dad clearly was in a lot of pain. When I called the NHS direct, I was told that maybe he should have stayed in hospital. Dad went to see his GP on the Monday and he told me the doctor had said to him \"Let's get this straight there is nothing wrong with you, you have indigestion\".\r\nThe following night my dad collapsed at home with a leaking aneurysm and died. To have seen my dad like that, it will live with me for the rest of my life. \r\nMy dad did have a post mortem and cause of death was a leaking aneurysm. I believe the hospital should have picked this up especially with my dad's medical history. I think further tests should have been done and I am angry with the hospital for not doing so. He may have been 89 but I think he had every right to medical treatment. My husband died there last year so the place is not a happy one for me, but that's another nightmare of a story to follow.\r\n", "It took 7 months for my husband to be diagnosed with terminal cancer although in those 7 months his blood results were coming back very abnormal. His gp did nothing further to investigate why, we just kept being told could be an infection/inflammation and he was given pain killers/and antibiotics. \r\n\r\nAfter the 7 months I asked for x-rays and tests to see what was causing him all this pain, within a week we had an appointment with a chest specialist and we were told the news that my husband had a large tumour on his lung and it had spread into his gullet, neck and prostate and there was nothing they could do. He went through 4 months of chemo and 2 very large treatments of radiotherapy, he went on to have 2 further diagnosis one in the brain and another mass found in his abdomen. In my opinion if our gp had done more at the start this may have been found and maybe even treatable. \r\n\r\nThe day my husband passed away i had called in the nurses to give my husband injections of morphine which had been brought into our home a few days prior. He had 3 injections during the day and late afternoon the nurse handed over to the night time staff and my family and I were told he would not live through that night as by this time his organs were shutting down. \r\n\r\nThe next visit was due at 8pm to give him pain relief as he was in constant pain but we were told we could call the nurses out before if he needed the injections sooner. My husband was in extreme pain and screaming for the morphine. We could not get any response from our phone calls [ just an answer machine] when we finally got through at 8 40 pm my husband passed away in agonising pain, one hour after he died 2 nurses turned up saying they had come to give him his injection! \r\n\r\nWe could not believe what had happened and the matter was taken further in an official investigation, but we were not satisfied with the final report which we felt covered up for the incompetent and uncaring nursing skills we experienced. It had been bad enough that the late diagnosis had happened but then for my husband to be left to die in the pain was a total lack of care. Our family now has no faith in the nhs at all.\r\n", "I was in need of assistance, and was attended by a male and female ambulance crew. I feel that right from the start they refused to believe that I was truly in need, even though by then I could barely walk or talk. When they did not help me up, I lost my balance and fell, dislocating one of my fingers, which they then did not treat. They dragged me out of the house, even though I feel that my lack of mobility required the use of a wheelchair or stretcher. I was left with bruises and swelling on my forearms where they moved me from my house, and I damaged my knees where they dropped me on the road, and I then had to crawl into the ambulance. I have photographic evidence of my injuries. My trauma didn't stop there - in the back of the ambulance the female crew member pushed an airway tube down my throat even though she knew I was conscious, I think this was because I refused to answer questions about my children. My concern is that this pair are still out and about, working with vulnerable people. In my opinion they should be disciplined and prevented from going anywhere near the public for a very long time.\r\n", "Hi,\r\nMy sister is 17 weeks pregnant. She's in Walsgrave hospital Coventry. My sister went in to hospital last week and is in hospital because she kept being sick and she has got a bad water infection. The day after she went into hospital, my sister lost loads of blood clots and then at 10am water came away from my sister. The nurse came in the room and said she was in labour, they never scanned her or anything. \r\nAll threw the day she was in agony and then at 9.00 pm still no sign of the baby, they was going to give her a tablet to speed up her labour and then a new nurse came in the room and said she was going to give her a scan, so at 10.00 pm 12 hours later we found out her waters never broke and she was not in labour. So that means they could of gave my sister that tablet and that would of put her in labour at 17 weeks and she would have lost her baby and now my sister is carrying a healthy baby girl. All the time she was in pain they treated her really bad. \r\nThank you for listening to my story.\r\n", "I need to put closure on this matter but do not know how to. I have written to the GP, but not received a reply. I then wrote to the practice manager asking for an explanation as to why my GP did not discuss my results with me when I was pregnant in 2002.

I have been down complaints procedures and ombudsman but I am out of time limits?

The chief executive has stated he will not be looking into the problems I encountered.  The responses I have received from the chief executive have consisted of probably no more than 15 words in each correspondence.  This is in stark contrast to other hospitals responses.  I have come to the conclusion that the current chief executive probably has not even read my initial complaint and would probably work very nicely alongside the neurologist I made a complaint about (in the sense of their letter writing skills).\r\n\r\nThe neurologist I saw at Queen's got my diagnosis completely and totally wrong which meant I had 2 strokes.

The curtains had blood on then and I asked for another pillow and it cam with three large fresh blood stains like it had come from another very ill patient. I complained but the nursing staff ignored me. They spent most of the time standing around chatting. I was very frightened and will not go to the doctors again as I do not want to end up back there.

They do not give a straight answer to any question.

He was admitted in June with a stroke, he died after suffering badly.\r\n\r\nParalysed down one side and blind, his meals were left untouched.  Liquids, so important once he had contracted C-Diff, were left unopened (in the case of the nutritional meal supplement), or too far to reach in the case of the water jug.  In either case he could not see them, and could not have reached them as he was immobile.  He complained that he was lying in his own excrement, it was heart wrenching.  He often cried.\r\n\r\nMy mother and I eventually caught up with the Doctor who agreed that in the circumstances a drip would be an ideal and desirable solution.  The next day we were delighted to see a drip installed, but it was empty.  We never visited Dad to find the drip anything other than empty, and we do not know, to this day when or if that drip ever got changed, despite constant reminders to any nurse not too busy to listen to us to change it.\r\n\r\nNursing was not in evidence.  Everyone was too busy to answer our anxious queries, or clustered round the nurses station chatting.  We took food in, we made sure Dad drank, but it broke our hearts to hear him say how much pain he was in, and nothing seemed to be done for it.\r\n\r\nAs visitors we had to wear a plastic apron and use hand gel.  But nurses and administrators often came in lacking either.  Visitors' toilets were often overflowing with dirty paper towels and obviously were not cleaned regularly.  We worried for the lack of hygiene.\r\n\r\nDad recovered (or did he?) from his first bout of C-Diff and was moved to a geriatric ward where plans were made for his release home.  Within a week he contracted C-Diff again, and died.  Me and my siblings desperately wanted to put in an official complaint, but my mother would not hear of it, being in deepest grief after 63 years of marriage to a wonderful man.

The third cancellation was on the day of the operation by phone. When I complained they said they would call me back. They said they had found me a bed, but not on an orthopaedic ward. I had no idea of the significance of this and was glad to accept. The operation went as planned. However the nursing care after this was not adequate. I could not move without the help of a \"monkey ring\", was left lying in the bed. I had bed sores within 24 hours.  My son insisted that I be moved to an orthopaedic ward. I was moved after three days, in great pain.  The DVT stockings had not been replaced after the operation and I developed DVT. After 5 days I had a pulmonary thrombosis in the middle of the night. The response to this was very quick and very efficient and I know that they saved my life, but I am sure that I would not have developed this if my nursing care immediately after the operation had been adequate. I then became very anaemic. A family member (a practioner nurse) drew their attention to my low blood count, as no one else appeared to have noticed. I was then given a blood transfusion.

My brother absconded from his home, faking his suicide in October 2005. In May 2006 he reappeared in our lives having been an inpatient following attempted suicide in January/February 2006 in a London borough. He was then found acting strangely on a beach in East Sussex, picked up by the police and returned to his psychiatrist under section. Although we hadn't seen him since October 2005, because the place of safety was a police station, we were unable to see him again, or given any information about where he was returned to. He then turned up at my mum's flat and decided to stay in our locality. In spite of our concerns about his mental health, he was discharged from the London borough as not needing psychiatric services as he DNA (did not attend) a clinic appointment even though he was on strong drugs. There was no handover to local psychiatric services in spite asking for this. He had a stash of drugs, got more from his new GP and committed suicide in June 2006.\n\nAfter his suicide his psychiatrist from London contacted my mother and myself, which seemed to be a process of passing on the blame from himself in case we made a complaint.

After a few days she seemed to pick up a little, much to our relief. That is until she was moved to a ward that was closed at the time due to a bug infection, they still put her in that ward anyway. My grandmother started being sick after meals and lost her appetite and also started getting very depressed. The staff then claimed my grandmother was making herself sick and did not find out the reasons behind her sickness. My grandmother became very poorly and fragile and could not hold a cup properly, so asked for a beaker. This was taken away and replaced with a cup again, so she then kept spilling on herself.\r\nOne evening a care assistant decided it was time my grandmother got out of bed and walked to the toilet. My grandmother said she didn't feel able. Considering she could only walk few steps with the physio therapist, there was no way she could manage a walk half way down the ward. She got there with what I can only imagine was a real struggle, but fell on the way back! I am a care assistant, so I see this as abuse, as I am sure this care assistant should know if she has ever done a POVA (Protection of Vulnerable Adults) course and had any common sense. As 3 weeks have passed since she arrived on the ward, they have now realised my grandmother has the diarrhea and sickness bug, after weeks of saying that she was making herself sick.\r\nI would not rate this ward for its care and can only see my grandmother get weaker and more poorly by the day through lack of care.\r\n", "I was admitted in November 09 for a total thyroidectomy after being diagnosed with cancer in October (had a hemithyroidectomy in September). The surgery went well, my consultant is a great guy. Ward 21: very busy. However, I hardly dared ask anything when after requesting some pain killers, I was told rather nastily: you're not the only one 'love'; you'll have to wait! And wait I did. For an hour! \r\nDischarged in the middle of November, whilst complaining of feeling nauseous and tingly but 'you'll be fine' I was told. Got home feeling worse; didn't sleep as I was tingling all over and rang the ward on the next day  at 7 am to ask for advice; I was told to come back straight away before I started 'cramping' and to bring my suitcase with me. My partner drove me back but I got into such a state - fingers paralysed, unable to talk that an ambulance picked me up and rushed me in. \r\nHypocalcemia: no calcium left in my body. I was re-admitted for a couple of days and given loads of calcium. My consultant came to explain that the glands that produce the calcium were damaged during surgery and only one was left which was re attached to the muscle. I should have had a blood test before I was discharged, especially when I was complaining of tingling but I didn't have on. I believe this was because they needed the bed. This was a very scary experience. Following my second discharge, I got terrible headaches: I kept losing my balance, hitting furniture, tripping until I became totally confused: couldn't figure out how to get dressed, use the toilets, write etc. \r\nI went to the A & E at 1 pm at the beginning of December; my partner explained how confused I was and getting slowly worse; I was seen by a triage nurse at 16.30! Then a doctor said I needed a CT scan but needed to be admitted. Got a bed at 18.30 in the assessment ward and just waited there with this excruciating headache. Saw another doctor at 23.30 who again said I needed to have a CT scan but it was by then too late. He thought I might have had a slight stroke. I asked for something for the pain. Come the next morning I was still waiting for pain relief, saw another doctor who said yet again that I needed to have a CT scan! But I'd have to wait as they were very busy; still waiting for pain relief; then got told that I'd have to wait until Tuesday as they had emergencies to deal with first and I was not one of them. Then, I was told I'd have to wait until Wednesday.\r\nAnyway, another junior doctor got involved and managed to book me an MRI for the Tuesday. This took place and the doctor told me that I'd had a bleed in the brain but they were sending the scan to Royal Hallamshire for advice. I was still in the assessment unit by then and finally heard from Hallamshire two days later.\r\n Was then told by another doctor that it was not a bleed but a blot clot and I could go home; just like that? yes, it'll get better by itself. Can it happen again? oh yes, as it's happened once already! And it's safe for me to go home even with this terrible headache? Yes. This was 10 in the morning: I left at 4 pm as it took 6 hours of waiting to get the medicine from the pharmacist. By then, I was not 'confused' anymore but very unhappy as I was scared. \r\nI went to see my GP and they made enquiries which led to the following: none of the neurosurgeons and radiographers could agree on a diagnosis. So, nearly a month later, the headaches have more or less gone but my head feels 'tight' and 'fuzzy' at times, not to mention slight episodes of confusion and I am having another MRI in Sheffield this week. Well before starting my radioactive treatment.\r\nI know how busy nurses and doctors are but being courteous and showing a bit of understanding doesn't take any longer than being uncaring or rude. Don't these doctors and nurses realise how this series of events could be distressing to me, especially in my vulnerable position? I am angry that I have been treated like this, with no regards whatsoever for my feelings and after my experiences I do not want to be treated at Doncaster Royal Infirmary again.\r\n", "I had an operation at UCLH 3 years ago, which I believe resulted in ongoing debilitating pain. The consultant would say \"I wonder whats causing it''. I couldnt go back to work and after 2 years, UCLH tried to persuade me it was ''nerve pain''. UCLH tried to suggest that it would go away and that I needed CBT to ''deal with it''.\r\nI was in severe pain, getting worse, with for example 3 months at the begiining of 2009 where just crossing my living room was so painful I was amazed the consultant could leave a person in this state. I was on such strong painkillers - patches - that I was asleep half the waking day - but which was a relief from the pain. I asked my GP to refer me to another hospital after 2.5 years. That hospital identified, at the first scan, that I had a huge incisional hernia, involving bowel. I had it repaired there. \r\n\r\nI had approaximately 12 scans of the area at UCLH in the two year period before the second hospital took me on. The staff never said the word hernia, tried to make me feel like I had perhaps imagined it and also offered no advice in how to manage a hernia of this size.\r\n\r\nI have suffered with loss of useful working life, quality of life - and of course nearly lost my home because of being disabled by the hernia.  I have had no social life for these 3 years because the small energy I manage to summon up out of the pain, I have had to work to pay my mortgage, at home.\r\nA sad side effect is that I have nearly lost my trust in doctors. \r\n", "My husband was admitted at the end of November 2007 with splenic lymphoma.   When this was diagnosed 17months earlier he had  been admitted to the Isolation Ward. Although no-one told us or our GP this ward was closed from 14th July 2007 until 7th January 2008 for refurbishment.   The hospital's policy for caring for immune suppressed patients during this period was for them to be nursed in amenity rooms around the hospital.\r\nConsidering the difficulties and lack of guarantee in the sterility of such rooms I think it is reprehensible that such rooms should be considered suitable for those whose immune system is already weakened.\r\nBecause the amenity rooms were spread around th hopsital that put great pressure on the doctors and detracted from the care they could give.\r\n\r\nMy husband was put on a general/elderly ward where I believe one person had pneumonia.   This ward was very busy and when I asked a nurse how she coped with so many people calling for help she said \"I don't hear.\"\r\n\r\nHe was catheterised for what I feel was no positive reason, which caused excessive bleeding which was not recognised, monitored or recorded.    I repeatedly told doctors, nurses, everyone, but no-one acknowledged the seriousness of this.    AT the complaint hearing I was told a drip of blood can look a lot but actually means nothing.    They refuse to acknowledge the degree of blood lost but I was with my husband from 9am to 11pm every day, I know how excessively he was bleeding and how much pain he was in.\r\n\r\nI tried to get my husband out of there but no-one could suggest an alternative, even though I wanted to pay for better care for my husband.  There were no systems in place.\r\nMy husband died on at the beginning of December, 2007, officially from septicaemia and pneumonia.\r\n\r\nI believe the closure of the isolation ward played a big part in my husband's death. The pressures this put on the doctors meant that, in my opinion, inappropriate procedures were ordered by doctors who I feel were inexperienced and whose actions damaged my husband so profoundly.", "I am sorry that you are disappointed that we have not yet been able to fully respond to your complaint.\r\n\r\nWhilst there are other people within the organisation that undoubtedly could assist, it is perhaps more helpful in terms of continuity to stay with the same person.\r\n\r\nI do hope that you will feel able to contact the clinician whose email address we supplied you with. This offer of support is still open for you to utilise at any time.", "I underwent a routine vaginal hysterectomy last year. I was lying back in the ward after surgery when my sister-in-law came to visit me. She was shocked to discover that I had lay there for almost 4 hours without any observations having been carried out. She immediately asked for observations to be done where they discovered my pulse, blood pressure and heart rate were going haywire. It was discovered that the surgeon had severed an artery. I was rushed back into theatre for repair and received 5 pints of blood as I'd been bleeding internally. I came round again in the ward in the middle of the night to find a lot of staff standing round my bed. Apparently I'd been overdosed on morphine and had to be given some form of anti-dote. I struggled to breathe and had to be given oxygen periodically for the next 2 days. Almost 9 weeks later and I'm still in pain, have no energy and have started suffering panic attacks. I should have been back to work 2 weeks ago but I just can't manage. The consultants reply was to say to me these things happen.", "Firstly I am sorry that there has been a delay in my reply \u2013 there was a computer glitch which meant that the reply I sent on 11/2 got lost. \r\n\r\nI have spoken with my colleagues in East Sussex and found out what would have happened if the circumstances that you described occurred now. While this will not erase the past or the distress caused to you I hope it will offer some reassurance to you and other readers.\r\nYour brother would have been admitted to the place of safety in the DoP (Department of Psychiatry) in Eastbourne which would have enabled you to visit him and him to be looked after in sympathetic circumstances while an assessment was made.  Unless there were specific reasons not to (for example previously expressed wishes which we knew about from the service user not to share information) this assessment would involve you as family members to glean information to aid our risk assessment and to make appropriate plans for his immediate care.\r\n\r\nIt's difficult to comment on why London discharged him due to a DNA or did not instigate a handover to local services but I would like to think that we would not do this with someone who presented a risk of suicide.  The issue here is probably all around risk assessment \u2013 sadly sometimes we assess risk as low but it can change rapidly for some people and lead them to suicide.  Transfers should involve families unless there is a good reason not to as they provide valuable perspectives for us when working with someone new and the trust has made public commitments to involving carers in care planning.\r\n\r\nGood CPA, competent risk assessment and carer involvement are all factors that may have been helpful here, but it is difficult to judge on scant information.  These days we also share the results of SUIs ( Serious Untoward Incidents- investigations which happen automatically after someone commits suicide) and that can be an opportunity for families to ask questions that they feel have not been addressed and of some comfort in terms of closure. I also would expect you to be made aware of the support groups that there are for carers in East Sussex.\r\n\r\nIt there is anything that you would like to follow up in detail the Patient Advice and Liaison Service in the trust would be very happy to help \u2013 they can be contacted on 01323 446 042 or pals@sussexpartnership.nhs.uk\r\n", "I was admitted to Treliske with a suspected series of TIA's (mini-strokes).\r\nDuring my stay I encountered the most arrogant and unprofessional neurologist imaginable. This person was rude, ill-prepared for his 'consultation' (which was held on an open ward with no privacy) and totally disregarded any matters that I raised.\r\nHe made disparaging comments about me for daring to question his views about another agency in Cornwall (well known for 'failing' it's patients), failed to ascertain what steps I had taken of my own volition to address matters, then stomped off in a tantrum, failing to properly conclude his consultation.\r\nThis man breached my confidentiality more than once and possibly misdiagnosed me (other tests on-going at another hospital). Personally, I will never engage with this organisation again.", "My late son was an in patient at Humber Centre, Willerby. He committed suicide in 2007. It came to light at the inquest that the night before he died he received a visit from one of his solicitors pending early release. I learned at the inquest he was not approached by any member of staff after his visit even though it was said that he seemed disturbed. We also learned the senior member of staff left the ward that night to go to another ward leaving two people who I don't feel took their job seriously. The events of that night lead me to believe that they did not think to check on my sons state of mind following his visit. He was found hanging in the morning. \r\nStaff were aware that my son was always popping at the window asking for a light for his cigarette. I cannot understand why they did not stop to think, after a considerable amount of time, that he never appeared. I presume they were otherwise occupied. From what I understand, he was not checked that night at all. One of the members of staff said \u201cit could have been anyone\u201d but it wasn't, it was my son.\r\nThe jury came to the conclusion that if the sufficient and correct observations were carried out that night my sons death could have been prevented. I feel the right decision was not reached and we as a family were treated unfairly. \r\n", "My partner, went into Newtown Hospital as a informal patient, but because of his disability, of being tetraplegic, I felt they did not understand him, he was protecting himself (how would they feel if they were in a wheelchair, had no legs to walk on) but I think they thought he was being aggressive, and put him on a section 3, in my view so they could override  him, and take over and force him to take medication. In my opinion he had only got manic, because we were going to get married. After two weeks of being in there he was back to his normal self.  \r\nIn my opinion the  lack of care he got was disgusting and upsetting. Because I could of done it all myself, because I was his carer as well. He needed a lot more attention then a able bodied person and in my view they were not prepared for that and they had no idea how to look after him, on a daily basis. A drink was thrown on him, he could not feel it.  I feel he was neglected, human rights had been taken away from him, there was no heating on for him, he had no equipment to help him, or stop him from getting pressure sores. \r\n\r\nI felt that he was expected to do everything that  a abled bodied person could do, he  never did it when he was at home because he had carers. Why should things change? I feel that the care he had at home should of followed him into hospital. I feel the system let him down.\r\n\r\n ", "Dear JeanK\r\n\r\nThank you for taking time to comment on Patient Opinion.\r\n\r\nWe can confirm that our Trust's Isolation ward was closed during the period mentioned.   This was a planned closure to upgrade and refurbish the Isolation ward to a higher specification to enable the Trust to manage all types of infectious conditions.\r\n\r\nDuring this time alternative arrangements were in place to care for all patients who needed isolation.   All staff had access to advice and support from the Trust Palliative Care team and Specialist Pain team and patients are placed on the Liverpool Care Pathway as appropriate.\r\n\r\nWe would like to reiterate our offer to hold a further meeting with you to discuss any outstanding concerns.\r\n\r\nYours faithfully\r\n\r\nMary\r\n\r\nMary Dunne\r\nDirector of Nursing, Quality & Patient Services\r\n", "I shall try and be brief with my story but it starts in the first week in November when I was admitted with a fractured hip.\r\n\r\nDuring my week on the ward I had 2 Hypos because I am diabetic and had no help from the nursing staff even though I informed them of my routine to monitor my diabetes. I was sent home after having an operation to repair my fracture but whilst I was on the ward I contracted an infection.\r\n\r\nI was cared for by Community nurses while at home and they informed me that the wound had not been closed properly and that was the cause of the infection. After 12 days my staples were removed and the wound opened up to reveal the puss which is associated with infections.\r\n\r\nMy leg is now 1 inch shorter and rotated outwards and when I contacted the surgeons secretary to try and make a follow up appointment only to be told I had been discharged and I would have to be referred via my GP.\r\n\r\nBecause of these failings I contacted PALS who made an appointment to see a consultant, regarding my hip today. The consultant informed me that I should have been seen by the hospital at least twice before today and he subsequently apologized for the hospital failings.\r\n\r\nI am totally disgusted by the treatment I have received from the hospital and intend to persue this matter further.", "I believe that incompetence, negligence, and lack of communication with relatives (carers) and GP over a period of nearly 5 years, resulted in my son (aged 29) taking his own life while suffering from schizophrenia. Actions by some practitioners were counter-productive, in my view, and served to work against best outcome.\r\n\r\nI was exasperated by the internal investigation, which left my questions and concerns unanswered. In my view it did not address the failings of systems and individuals concerned, as far as I could tell. I felt that the official complaints procedure was slow, poorly executed, and the result not fit for purpose. For instance, in the clear-cut mishandled situations it appeared to me that staff suspensions were called-for, to highlight the blatant - and simple - failings in interaction, recording, following-up, and following through with care.\r\n\r\nI am so embittered that in my view just a little effort and diligence by people in the Trust (BSMHT), and by the GPs involved, could have saved our loved son from suicide, but they appear to have little real comprehension of their failings - and still less of Customer Service: the concept of that is alien.\r\n\r\nI have had to request an independent review by the Parliamentary Ombudsman for Health to look into failings by this Trust, and my son's GP who, in effect, was responsible for managing this case. Incompetence and simple human negligence prevailed, in my opinion; and my son, after years of efforts to keep fit and motivated, slid into a terrible depressive state in which he thought only he had the answer. We so miss him.\r\n", "I was extremely disappointed to hear about your experience. Without knowing the specifics of your case, it is difficult to comment. However it is unacceptable that as a patient with diabetes you were not provided with support to manage your condition. The Trust has a very experienced team of Diabetes Specialist Nurses, and a referral to this team should have been made. I apologise if this was not undertaken.  Extensive research suggests that patients with diabetes are more prone to infection and wound healing may take longer. May I reassure you that had there been evidence of any infection, a high temperature or a dirty wound at the time we were due to go home, your discharge would not have taken place. \r\n\r\nWhen a patient fractures their hip there are two ways that it may be fixed. The surgeon would have chosen the most appropriate way depending on a number of factors. A fracture of this kind can take up to 6 months to heal properly, although inevitably there will be a degree of leg shortening. I do apologise if this was not fully explained to you. \r\n\r\nThe follow up arrangements including an Out Patient appointment are patient specific and dependent upon factors such as the cause of the fracture and the age of the patient.  I apologise if you felt that you should have been seen earlier by a Consultant,  and I hope that this has now occurred and that your concerns have been alleviated. \r\n", "We recognise that a suicide in the family is a distressing occurrence and we do our best to support and work with families with regard to the outcome of internal investigations, the Coroners verdict and the impact of such a loss.

(there were many other issues too, but i shall not go into them now) The midwife at the time, told me I had a small tear and not to be a baby, for some reason she did not stitch me up. I have had to have 3 repair ops and 2 blasts of plastic surgery to try and rectify some of the damage. I still have more to go, and now, with my second child, I am having to have a c-section, as another birth may un-do the work done. The experience left me severely traumatised and it has taken 9 years to come to terms with it and consider having more children.\r\n\r\nThe after care was alot better.

Abbiamo deciso di rivolgerci dunque a un polo di eccellenza della nostra citt\u00e0. Un ago aspirato ha confermato la natura delle calcificazioni: non un nodulo unico ma una presenza multifocale di addensamenti di cellule tumorali che rendeva necessaria l'asportazione di tutta la mammella. In sede di prericovero i chirurghi plastici hanno proposto a mia madre una terapia sperimentale con dell'iniezione di botulino nella ferita in sede operatoria per facilitare l'andamento della ferita nel postoperatorio e in quell'occasione una dottoressa le ha spiegato la natura e l'invasivit\u00e0 dell'intervento.                                                                Dopo una settimana mia madre \u00e8 stata operata: all'uscita dalla sala operatoria nessun chirurgo si \u00e8 presentato a me e mio padre per spiegarci come fosse andato l'intervento e alla domanda di mia madre, ancora intontita dall'anestesia, se le avessero conservato o meno il capezzolo non sapevo cosa rispondere. Un chirurgo giovane che avevo visto in reparto mi ha sommariamente delucidata: \u00e8 stato questo medico giovane a dirmi il nome del chirurgo che aveva operato mia madre. Dopo qualche ora un medico di turno (non il chirurgo che l'aveva operata) ha fatto il giro delle stanze, cartella clinica alla mano, leggendo ci\u00f2 che era stato fatto. Mia madre aveva molto male ma, a quanto c'era scritto sul foglio compilato con i chirurghi plastici, l'iniezione del botulino non era compatibile con la somministrazione di alcun farmaco che potesse alleviare il dolore muscolare. Il chirurgo che ha operato mia madre non \u00e8 MAI passato a vedere la sua paziente: il giorno successivo gli ho chiesto lumi riguardo la questione del botulino e mi sono sentita suggerire di andare al secondo piano dove avrei trovato il reparto di Chirurgia Plastica. Alla fine, con immensa amarezza, ho scoperto che mia madre , in sede operatoria, non era stata ritenuta idonea a quella procedura ma nessuno, infermieri compresi, ne sapeva nulla. Non c'\u00e8 stata la minima cura per la persona e per la paziente: la comunicazione era lasciata al caso.L'esito positivo dell'intervento e dell'esame istologico che ha rivelato linfonodi negativi e una tipologia di tumore poco aggressiva ha stemperato questa brutta esperienza ma non consiglierei a nessuno con un problema analogo di rivolgersi al reparto di senologia di questa struttura.", "I underwent a right breast mastectomy under the care of a general surgeon at Royal Bolton Hospital, a few years ago. I was left severely disfigured. \r\nI ended up litigating against the hospital because of the damage caused by the breast reconstruction surgery performed on me. I felt bullied by one individual during this process who was not willing to answer any questions in relation to the surgeon even though I arranged to meet him on that pretext.\r\nI do not cast any blame on the breast nurses but I do believe they are forced to behave like robots through pressure from the surgeons who work above them, and are forced to say what they are told to say which felt to me very limited when dealing with a person's care.\r\nThe amount of \u00a3250,000 was spent in legal aid , which is of course public money on my fight for some kind of justice, driven partly by the fact that I believe that there have been a number of court reports involving this surgeon before, and also of course because of the way the surgeon has left me badly disfigured and in need of an awful lot of major plastic surgery, despite telling me the outcome of the initial surgery would achieve an acceptable result.\r\nI am now on a waiting list to go to a top plastic surgeon of the calibre I now need to undergo possibly years of major plastic surgery all because of this surgeons unacceptable standard of surgery.\r\nIn my opinion, the system for victims of medical accidents seeking support and direction as to where to go to have their severe disfigurement improved or corrected is diabolical. I think it badly needs a shake up. There ought in fact to be a no faults policy in place, so that when someone experiences what I have, they are not treated as the underdog, forced to pursue justice in the way I have had to. I feel like in my case the surgeon was cowardly and hid behind the system which is wrong.\r\nI think NHS clientele should be entitled to an automatic explanation by the surgeon involved, and an immediate offer of compensation. \r\nI do not know if anybody else has experienced poor dealings with this breast cancer care department both within the context of the bad attitudes and the standard of surgery, but my guess is that I am not the only patient who feels badly let down by this body of people at Royal Bolton Hospital.\r\n", "I had an absolutely terrible time with this hospital and particularly this department. I was referred to QMC by my doctor early last year due to menstrual pain. I was given an ultra sound and it was discovered that I had a cyst on my ovary which did not go. I was booked in for a Laparoscopy in September 2009 to have it removed and also to check for Endometriosis, which it was suspected may be causing my pain.\r\nAfter the surgery I was in quite a lot of pain, however was assured this was normal. I was told the cyst was gone, there was no endometriosis and everything had gone smoothly. The lower half of my body and my 'privates' turned a dark red/black colour like there was blood under my skin. I told the nurses and my surgeon, who told me they'd not seen it before. I was given just an ice back to ease it. I was sent on my way a few days later despite insisting I was in terrible pain. The pain got progressively worse and around a week after the Op I ended up at A&E in agony. I couldn't move. \r\nA&E staff were absolutely brilliant, however they could only refer me to the same ward I'd come from. Once back on that ward I feel like I was left in a terrible state. One night I screamed and Sobbed for 4 hours before the nurses finally fetched the doctor to come and see to me. I begged them for pain relief and they said to me to be quiet as I was upsetting the other patients. After a terrible few days of feeling like I was being neglected by one particular nurse I discharged myself. I ended up back at A&E less than a week later. A&E gave me ultrasounds and found I had lots of pockets of blood and pus throughout my abdomen and diaphragm - I was referred straight back to Gynaecology. This time I think I had a much better nurse who made a dramatic difference to my experience.\r\nIt was eventually established that I had bled internally, had a severe internal infection and also, the endometriosis I was told I didn't have - I do! I am still unable to go to the toilet properly, and slightly incontinent, and am in constant pain that I feel is much worse since having the surgery (prior to this, the pain was only during menstruation). I am still being treated there despite requesting a transfer on several occasions, which I feel has been simply ignored. It now seems I will need corrective surgery, and throughout all this, the only explanation I have as to what is going on is or what is actually still wrong is the doctors saying to me, \"It's just one of those things\" and \"You might have IBS\". \r\nI didn't realise I could contract IBS from surgery as it seems to me this is what they are suggesting. I have had no apology and regarding all the problems in my treatment I was told, \"Well you signed the consent form so there's nothing you can do.\" This may be the case, but it does not mean I'm not going to try. I am now seeking legal advice regarding this hospital and this department. The only good thing I have to say about my experience is the catering staff are lovely and I came across one nurse on the ward who I found to be very caring and nice. The rest of the nurses that I came across I felt were acceptable at best. There were three in particular that I met who I thought were disgraceful. One of these people I would like to be investigated as she wrote down that she had given me medication which I believe she hadn't. \r\n\r\n", "My husband was 52 he was being treated for high blood pressure.

As a result was left with out treatment and since suffered many relapses,  self harm and suicide attempts. \r\n\r\nIn my view the Male appointed A&E staff had no idea how to show respect and treat carefully a female patient, and then the male ISA assessment mental health staff, would dismiss these repeated attempts, solely as a cry for help. Yet this was far from the truth, and the real risks to the patient, still 6 yrs on, still keeps being down played, What with the new CPA DOH and So called guidelines all trusts should follow, well, the only way again this person, found out she had a cpa. was when she asked for copies of her medical records. \r\n\r\nThe lack of respect and understanding and cold bias remarks, made about this person, in her care notes, caused further set backs , and tried to officially complain, as this still got no where, and still the trust are not putting her health and life at risk, by still failing to under stand how to treat a female long term, from the effects of sex crimes and someone trying to kill her. So in my opinion trauma related long term life term treatment, is needed.\r\n\r\nShe got help to apply for CICA and 6yrs on also still waiting for payout.  Yet this female trying to live a daily life is a nightmare, on so many pills to stop the nightmares/ sleeping pills. to help sleep, and pills for the daytime to help cope with the thoughts, of fear, and yet in my view the CMHT so called CARE manger / not trained well enough in these areas, and then the trust, tells the female patient, she cannot have a female doctor too, as the trust only have males. Question here is, how are victims of sex abuse , and rape able to trust and relate to male doctors? When the female is only able to see the face of the persons, that caused the crimes to her. Then this leads to futher set backs in her recovery and further high risks of self harm, and suicide, when the staff, do not manage her care, in line with set policy. \r\n\r\nThen self neglect sets in , no self worth, not able to be part of life, left alone to cope alone, no trust in family/ they caused the child abuse/ no one to trust, and none hearing her voice. Professionals, meant to care jointly to make sure she is safe all ways. Yet this never happens in my view, all they care about is cost cutting still and pushing the DOH National frame work on how to treat complex cases. Oh well, its to costly for the trust, to make sure the life of this human being is safe, when one surely knows its should be about choice of treatments and all professionals doing what the tax payer pays their wages to do.\r\n \r\nSo my views are that, from GP Practice to NHS mental health trust to others meant to help her, is still failing her, and now what with the NHS trust in london hosptail failed in treating her, for their failed knee op, she also needs other forms of help in this area, to which this time the so called joined up NHS / adult care services / county council / failing to provide service provision for her needs to in these areas, So what a life one may say, yet i am sure a 45 yr old does not tick the boxs for funding for help and treatment and help and support, well i am sure their are many other like this person , in UK suffering still and no matter about the new national care service coming in, this will only make it harder to prove, one needs the care, where is the human caring gone in the NHS? \r\n", "I'm sharing my story because I believe I have been failed by the NHS.

I returned to him a week later, by which time it was about the size of a dinner plate and I was having trouble standing, moving my arm or eating- he sent me to hospital.\r\n\r\nThe treatment I received was, frankly, shocking.  I came in looking understandably worse for wear and was sent to the surgery ward.  The two nurses who did my examination asked how often I showered and washed my clothes and how many sexual partners I had had ( I was at the time an 18 year old girl) I hadn't showered that day as I was so ill but assured them I was otherwise hygienic.  They sent me in to have the abscess drained, and sent swabs for tests.  I asked for a diagnosis or treatment options and they told me to moisturise my skin, and stop shaving my armpits.  \r\n\r\nThe boils, however, kept recurring and I called up a month later with four more to see the results of the tests.  They said I needed a GP to call,so I got my GP to call, and they said they had no record of me or any tests.  I sent them a copy of my surgical wristband and they acknowledged I had been admitted but they had lost the swabs.\r\n\r\nI demanded to see a dermatologist, but this was declined.  Saddened, I began to cry in the GP's office, asking for some different antibiotics or a referral.  She told me to stop shaving my armpits, moisturise and gave me antidepressants.  Which I did not take.  She then asked me whether I missed my absent father and whether I worried about cancer, at which point I left.\r\n\r\nCut to 18 months, a year of 7 different antibiotics, two sets of lost tests and a lot of judgemental NHS doctors faced with a \"silly young girl who can't wash properly\" later, and I finally got a referral to a dermatologist, who looked at my over 20 boils and scars, and me shivering and vomiting, and took a set of swabs that were not lost.  I was finally diagnosed with Panton-Valentine MRSA, a rare and dangerous form of MRSA.  She assured me I could carry on shaving, and now I am cured.  \r\n\r\nThe whole experience made me feel silly, and a little mad - who wouldn't, after being told by doctor after doctor that all you needed was a dash of moisturiser, all the while being debilitated by fever and boils.  Whether they were trying to keep MRSA off their hospital records, or simply dismissing an 18 year old student as a filthy boil-ridden fresher, I do not know but I feel I was judged for my gender, age and appearance before anyone took notice of my medical problem.  It still causes me to doubt doctors today.", "My dad had been in agony since April 2008 and he told me he was convinced he had cancer. He was told a number of times he had osteoporosis. In the end he was told he had cancer. It had spread and he lived for 6 weeks after this. I think that was terrible as he didn't have the pain relief I think he should have had and his death wasn't pleasant.", "My mum went into Castle Hill a beautiful lady who was totally sane and in my opinion came out in a box and was anything but. I think the ambulance crew who saw her would second that as they asked her all the questions in the back of the ambulance and she answered them all with no hesitation at all.\r\nI think the lack of respect and dignity shown to my mum who was supposed to be making a recovery was diabolical. I feel there was a lack of care by certain members of staff. I feel like my poor beautiful mum died in unnecessary pain despite the family continually asking for help.\r\nIn my opinion she was neglected so many times, we were told she climbed over the bars on the bed like a mad person and had two falls. We were also told she had been violent to a member of staff and had to be restrained but I think my mum did not have a single ounce of violence in her body when she went in to hospital. My experience of her was she was a sweet gentle lovely lady and we now have to live with the fact that she has now gone and she died in pain in front of our eyes. \r\nI will never forgive what happened to her.", "For 5 years we helped our son deal bravely with his worsening mental illness but with what we felt was little or no help from our GP. In fact in our view their responses were difficult to obtain (ignorantly quoting patient confidentiality in this case), and they aggravated the situation. My son, who suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, became convinced that doctors and their entourage were all involved in the 'plot' against him, as he imagined.No wonder then that medication was declined. As a result, in our view the NHS wrote him off as far as contact and support went, presumably waiting for an 'incident' which they could classify as concrete. However, though there was a street incident involving the police in 2007 this was never brought to the GPs attention for action, and my appeals for better care and support were ignored.There was an incident where in my view the GP lied to me about a requested attendance at the house. Their resultant actions destroyed my son's and my confidence in their abilities altogether and led to my son losing his trust in us (parents) also. He would not again talk freely about his suffering.He killed himself to escape his mental torment - which the GP could have helped with had they shown more empathy and less intransigence. The GP has learned nothing as far as I can tell.I have also reported [my story](https://www.patientopinion.org.uk/opinions/27718) under the mental health trust BSMHT as it appears that never the twain shall meet as regards having a joined-up service, and I wouldn't like the GPs to be left out from commenting.Refers to: GPs, Solihull Care Trust", "This was a terrible tragedy and our thoughts and condolences remain with you and your family.\r\n\r\nWe have met with you to try to answer your questions and to learn from your experience.

Due to a s35 warrant signed by a justice of the peace who had never seen me, the police x2, my consultant and my social worker refused to respect my wishes.\r\n\r\n  They claimed they wanted to chat.  As soon as they had entry by putting in my front door, I was taken handcuffed to a police car - having done nothing wrong.  My door was then left open to whomsoever attended the scene - I did not know them from Adam.\r\n\r\n  I was then taken to the Royal Edinburgh Hospital and sectioned. In my view my human rights were completely abused by the justice of the peace signing away my rights without my ability to represent myself or organise someone to represent me.  Furthermore, I can only do so \"on appeal\" rather than prima facia.  My right to freedom of expression was not respected.  My right to privacy was not respected.  My right to not be deprived of liberty was not respected.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my opinion at the Appeal hearing, I was not allowed to speak even with my citing the human rights act and article 6.  At the CTO hearing I was allowed to speak having specifically requested this in documentation.  However, my consultant had refused me access to a computer  the day before the hearing as a pass, even although I had four hour passes and weekend passes and a week pass over Xmas, with no issues arising.\r\n\r\n  The day of the CTO hearing I managed to get off ward to a computer and emailed 4 documents for the hearing arriving at about 11.30 am.  The hearing was at 2.00 pm.  My documents did not reach the Chairperson, nor lay representatives for the hearing and I only had copies of one document sent by email to give at the 2.00 pm hearing.\r\n\r\n  My human rights were abused by my Consultant and this I feel is consistent with his conduct towards me over 8 years.  The Mental Care and Treatment (Scotland) Act 2003 requires non-discriminatory practises, reciprocity and other principles - none, I feel are afforded to me. \r\n\r\n I have now moved area, which means a change of consultant, however, I am worried that my medical records are so misconstrued as to be falsely recorded.\r\n\r\n  My consultant is also required to provide me with a report for a court case for personal injury - he is refusing to do so because he normally liaises with a solicitor acting for me, in my case I am both the patient and litigant in person.\r\n\r\n  My case has been delayed for 6 years because of what I feel is his nonsense and he is effectively obstructing/perverting the course of justice and is acting in complicity with judge and respondents' solicitors on the case.\r\n\r\n  Whilst I was generally treated well by staff at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital, they are not autonomous.  I did say to a nurse \"Oi clothears\" to which I was told I was \"rude\".  I said, you can hear clothears but you can't hear \"human rights abuse\" ...

Having received no contact from BEH my GP sent yet another referral, again no response! I contacted PALS and 8 weeks following the initial referral I was invited to attend the Denis Scott unit and saw a person, who asked a series of questions which I answered. At no point did he enquire about the obsessive tendencies I had experienced or suicidal thoughts which I was increasingly experiencing.\r\n\r\nFour weeks following this 'assessment' I called the Denis Scott unit & spoke to a person who advised there had been a delay in dispatching correspondence and I should hear from the unit in a fortnight. As a Medical Secretary I understood the pressures on the admin staff however 4 weeks following my conversation, I called the unit again only to be told that my case had been reviewed by the clinician and deemed to be 'inappropriate'! To add insult to injury the correspondence advising the PCT, GP & myself had never been dispatched.\r\n\r\nIt was now FOUR MONTHS since initial referral from my GP. During this time my condition had worsened and due to to bereavement and further isolation I am increasingly considering suicide (which scares me). After four months and countless calls, each time I am advised someone will call me back, including the complaints department. I even called the Chief Executive's office & spoke to a person who took my details & advised she would arrange for someone in the Denis Scott unit to call me back that very day but no call was received.\r\nI am no further to receiving the care I need. Instead I was advised to call Barnet Mind who simply advise there is a three month waiting list for counselling! Had BEH's service been more efficient I would probably be receiving treatment now.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt the response will be that the service is improving but my experience is not too disimilar from the previous patient's comments which were left 4 months ago. I feel the 'assessment' process is merely a filtering process design to eliminate as many patients, as possible, of accessing the services offered by BEH as I have since discovered there is an 18 month wait for psychotherapy.

These were printed out on a single sheet of paper.\r\nThis, together with the written report were handed over to A&E - but have mysteriously gone missing. By then, my AF had ended, and so the tracings done in the hospital showed nothing but normal rythym. Thus, I then spent the next 36 hours arguing with the doctors, because the notes said that I had been admitted with 'chest pains', and made no mention of the AF.\r\nI complained to PALS - both at William Harvery Hospital and SECAM.

The fact that you are undergoing counselling as a consequence of the care received is deeply concerning.\r\nYour feedback will help us to further raise awareness amongst the staff about how important their individual care and attitude is. Overall there is a theme of a lack of empathy for you as a new mother and this is not an attitude we can tolerate.\r\nTreating women with compassion and respect is fundamental to the provision of good care. However you have shown vividly that we have staff whose attitude and behaviour clearly do not meet the expected standards. Providing a high standard of care on the postnatal ward is a challenge for many maternity units, and is the area which women are most likely to describe in negative terms. Over the past year, as a result of user feedback, we have implemented a series of actions and initiatives into the postnatal ward that are beginning to have a positive impact on the main areas of concern.\r\n\r\n- All staff on the postnatal ward are undergoing a customer care and communication skills training day as ongoing work to address issues related to attitude, behaviour and interpersonal skills.\r\n- A zero tolerance for rude, disrespectful or inconsiderate behaviour. Anybody who has been identified as demonstrating such behaviour will meet the Clinical Director to account for their actions. Disciplinary action will follow if no improvement is made\r\n- High sickness levels in this area have been targeted to reduce the dependency on using agency staff \r\n- Improving the ward environment to reduce midwife time spent away from the bedside \u2013 e.g., installing individual drug cabinets at each bedside to eliminate the waiting time for pain relief such as you experienced\r\n- Filling the vacancies that also contributed to the need for agency staff.\r\n- Increasing the number of maternity support workers, who are fully trained in breastfeeding and provide additional bedside support for which we have received very favourable feedback\r\n- Breastfeeding is such a crucial priority for postnatal mothers but can result in time management problems for a midwife with six other mothers and babies to care for (the standard ratio for postnatal care is one midwife to seven mothers and babies). We are appointing a dedicated breastfeeding midwife as a further resource to support the midwives in the ward and the mothers.\r\n\r\nIt is with regret that all of these actions are too late for you and we are so sorry that you have had such a terrible experience.\r\nYour posting will be used to continue the education of staff about the impact their attitude can have on every single woman in their care.

It was so frightening.\r\n\r\nFinally in May 2010 I got the opportunity to go home - thank god!\r\n\r\nI was, and am, so annoyed that during all that time I've had to pay for my care at the home and my DLA was stopped. I even had to pay for the taxi home. I now have carers pop in 3-4 times a week. Why was that so much to ask for in the first place?", "A very close friend of mine for over 30 years had been going through a period of chronic intestinal discomfort along with constant nausea, vomiting, and an inability to keep solid food down.\r\nThis started between 12 and 15 months, my friend had attended their local GP for a diagnosis and treatment at the start of the symptoms, including taking of prescribed medications in an attempt to relieve the situation.\r\nAfter several months with no relief and attending other GP's the impression my friend was left with at that stage was that it could be \"in the mind\".\r\nWhen I found out from my friend several weeks ago about the constant discomfort and an impact on quality of life, I implored my friend to seek specialist help in determining what exactly was wrong.\r\nMy friend was finally sent to Hartlepool General Hospital for an endoscopic evaluation. They also took biopsies and the results, when discussed with my friend by the specialist surgeon, was the last thing expected.\r\nMy friend was told you have cancer of the stomach and only have a few months to live. Not what one expects after complaining for at least a year via their GP and others.\r\nI feel it is disgraceful that this my friend had to endure these symptoms and discomfort for a year before being diagnosed with cancer. As far as I and other people close to this person feel, this should have been detected much sooner than it was, noting the history and longevity of the symptoms they endured.\r\nI believe if this had been evaluated more thoroughly and a diagnosis confirmed much sooner, then maybe the outcome could have been different. Because of my friend's advancing years, though they has been in very good health all their life, I feel they have been pushed aside with respect to quality health care and support.\r\nIn my opinion this should have been detected much much sooner than it was with a chance that the diagnosis would not have been so severe and certain as it is now.\r\nFor me, regardless of how a GP reacts, how busy they are, and all the mundane reasons patients are given in times of crises, it is the GP's responsibility to ensure he/she provides the best guidance and direction for their patients based on the information at hand and the longevity of a particular symptom(s).\r\nIn my opinion this situation fell through the cracks. I am very disappointed and angry at a scenario which I believe that should have been taken care of at the start of the symptoms, which in their entirety, to me, clearly showed a necessity for immediate action and remedial testing.\r\n", "We are very disappointed to hear of these complaints and take feedback very seriously.

He had been under a consultant for 3yrs and had been told time and time again he did not have cancer. He was sent home with imodium. His diarrhoea continued upto 25times a day. He was readmitted when he was in extreme pain 8weeks later, rehydrated and sent home again. 4weeks later he went in for surgery to remove a huge adenoma from his bowel we were assured it was not cancer. We were told the next day cancer had spread all through his abdomen. He died 7mths later...aged 53yrs. The consultant never even came to tell us they sent his registrar, they also never discussed the treatment with us. they made no attempt to explain anything until I lodged a complaint. Nearly 2yrs on and I'm still waiting for answers. I think this is disgusting.", "The following is the story of my son, Joshua\r\n\r\nTowards the end of October my wife had been feeling unwell for 2 or 3 days with a headache and sore throat. At around 9pm, her waters broke. This was nearly 3 weeks away from her due date. My mum advised us to phone the hospital which we did. \r\n\r\nAt the maternity ward we told the midwife that my wife was feeling unwell and described the symptoms very clearly. We repeatedly mentioned the illness and even discussed the concern that she may have caught something from our daughter, who had been very sick earlier in the week\r\n\r\nWe were given some advice and then discharged about an hour later and told to return anytime after 10am the next day.\r\n\r\nWith still no sign of labour the following day, at about 11.30am, we returned to the hospital. We explained that my wife was still feeling ill, tired and had a sore throat and headache. \r\n\r\nAt the hospital, she was monitored for contractions (still none) and given blood pressure and temperature checks.  We were later discharged and told that if the contractions hadn't started earlier to come back on Monday morning. \r\n\r\nMy wife started to have painful contractions at about 5.30am the next day. We phoned the ward and were told to wait until the contractions became more regular and intense. This seemed to happen very quickly. At about 6.15am we phoned and informed the ward that we were coming in.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Furness General at about 6.30am. Her contractions were very painful and intense. At 7.38am, our son Joshua was born. \r\n\r\nWe  may never truly understand what happened next, but in summary, not long after the birth, my wife collapsed with infection. Her temperature went to 39.2 and she developed rigours. She was given intravenous antibiotics and paracetamol and made a recovery over the next few hours. Although we were concerned for Joshua, we were reassured that he was fine. At around midday, we were transferred to the maternity ward. At this point we were told that the paediatrician had been contacted but they were \u2018very busy' but that Joshua would be monitored closely.\r\n\r\nThrough out the day and night, Joshua was monitored by various midwifes. He was mucousy, wheezy and reluctant to feed. We were told all these things were \u2018normal.' He had his temperature monitored and on several occasions his temperature was so low that he was placed on a heated cot to warm up. At one stage, he was placed on a headed cot and an overhead heater was placed directly over his body. At two o'clock in the morning, my wife rang the emergency bell by her bed because Joshua was making \u2018grunting' sounds and was breathing very rapidly. A midwife came and took Joshua out the room and returned him around 30 minutes later, again reassuring us that Joshua was fine.\r\n\r\nAt around 8am in the morning, my wife found Joshua collapsed in his cot, he was blue and saliva bubbles were coming out of his mouth. At this point, he was transferred to SCBU and was seen by a very shocked paediatrician for the first time.  \r\n\r\nJoshua had acquired the same infection as my wife. We now know that low temperature is an indicator of infection in neonates. Joshua spent 9 days fighting for his life but eventually died whilst receiving specialist intensive care in Newcastle. He died from internal bleeding from his left lung which had rotten due to his untreated infection. The consultant in Newcastle said that they had never seen lung necrosis in a neonate to the extent that Joshua endured.\r\n\r\nSadly, following Joshua death, his observation chart, which was the only record of his postnatal care, has been \u2018lost' and in my opinion the staff have not reported a truthful sequence of events.\r\n\r\nDespite this, there have been many changes to the maternity service at FGH since Joshua died and I am confident that the unit is now a safe place for others to have a baby.\r\n", "My story of being told my Atrial Fibrillation was harmless and then being told that my heart rate was normal when I was having a heart attack.  Then being told by another hospital that I had not had a heart attack.  My extreme chest pain being ignored. Being asked why was I playing the system by a nurse. Then being disbelieved when I found an alternative medication that actually worked.\r\n\r\nI have suffered from Atrial Fibrillation for most of my adult life and was constantly told by my GP that it was harmless.  But one day on the golf course last year my AF went out of control. I drove myself to the nearest hospital and presented myself at the A&E where I was told my heart rate was normal.  I insisted (being quite ill) and the nurse agreed to do an ECG.  This showed my heart rate to be 215. So much for the accuracy of the heart rate monitor she used on me the first time.  The nurse called in the resuss team by computer link and the next thing I was told I would shortly have a feeling of impending doom as a doctor unloaded a syringe of unknown fluid into my arm which was apparently designed to stop my heart for a moment. The nurse leaned over me and whispered \"You were right to come in to the hospital\". They took several hours trying to reduce my heart rate and I spent 5 days in the cardiac ward. I was told that I had had a Myocardial Infarction after tests had shown that damage had occurred.\r\nI was allowed to shower before going home and I felt very ill from the physical exertion just from having a shower.  This I was told was totally normal for heart attack patients.\r\n\r\nThis was not my local hospital so when I returned home I switched to my own hospital for tests.  This hospital decided that I had not had a heart attack at all and I was fine. Despite the fact that I could hardly climb the stairs at home. They took me off of the drugs and one week later I was back in A&E at my local hospital having been taken there by Emergency Ambulance.  This happened about 5 times in all and a 5 day stay in the cardiac ward was the highlight.  During that time I had extreme chest pains which lasted from midnight to dawn and I had to sit in a chair all night with oxygen.  According to the specialists I saw I was quite healthy.  A nurse even asked me why I was playing the system. (As if I would have put my health at risk by being in hospital other than for a genuine reason)\r\n\r\nI finally decided to try to work out what was happening for myself and realised by a process of elimination that while I was in hospital I was being injected with Heparin but when they sent me home that was the only drug I was not on.  I asked my specialist to be put on heparin and he agreed but only for  a couple of months.  After a few adjustments to the dose I was feeling much better.  Then after a couple of months my specialist wanted to take me off of the heparin because he could not find anything wrong with me. I managed to persuade him to keep me on heparin but 3 days before Christmas his secretary told me that I could no longer have any more heparin and that was final.  In my opinion the heparin was keeping me out of hospital. I didn't want to die so I phoned the police and they said they wouldn't do anything because it was a health matter.  So I wrote a letter to the chief executive of the local heath trust and within hours I was told I could be prescribed heparin by my local GP no problem.\r\nI could not stay on heparin for much longer due to possible side effects but luckily for me by chance I found an alternative form of blood thinning pill.\r\n\r\nI now feel fitter than any time in the last 20 years and I have had very few AF attacks and none for the last 3 months.  All my other symptoms have gone and I can play golf better than before. I have to be careful not to suddenly stress my heart but apart from that so far I am doing fine on my self prescribed alternative to Heparin.\r\nI must continue with the pills because having missed a dose or two I found my symptoms coming back again. I am having trouble convincing the medics that it actually works but I am from a very technical background where results are everything. I may be making some progress convincing them but there is huge resistance to new ideas in the NHS. There are many theories from doctors as to why what I am taking cannot work but the results show that for me it really does work.  I would not be paying 90 pounds a month if it did not work and all my friends know I am not renowned for spending money unwisely. Results are everything, theories are theories. That is Science.\r\n\r\nMy work involved diagnosis of technical problems and trouble shooting to the highest level and at one time I was in charge of protecting a major UK University's computers from attack by computer viruses. There were 60,000 different viruses at the time.  There are now around 300,000 computer viruses at large so I am glad I do not have to do that anymore!  I also designed an immune system for data disks.  If you don't think data disks can be given an immune system then think again.  So there was a striking similarity between my old job and what the NHS does.\r\n", "We are very sorry that in our original comment we said that you had met with the Trust on several occasions when in fact you have only just met with members of staff.  We apologise for this error which was the result of an administrative misunderstanding.  Thanks to your feedback, we have now put in place a new process which includes an initial check as currently happens and then a double check on all information with the relevant clinical teams before it is posted on any site.", "I have a 5 year old son diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorder and his difficulties first manifested as language delay, so he was referred to SALT in Leicester. This process took months, in the meantime he was also referred to audiology by GP and paediatrician to assess his overall development.\r\nWe were allocated a speech therapist who didn't seem to know much about autism and only saw him twice briefly at his nursery and never at home before writing a report for his multi-agency assessment. We were given limited guidance on how to help our son develop his language - a scruffy photocopied info sheet not aimed at children with developmental difficulties. All of the recommended intervention suggested in info sheet we had been doing for months, and if we had been asked we could have given more detail about language difficulties.\r\nI have faced rudeness when phoning the service at St Phillips House, and people refusing to transfer calls, and I had to keep leaving messages, I was never allowed the speech therapist's mobile phone number, despite other professionals having no issue with this.\r\nMy son then moved on to Menphys where I am aware that he has been allocated a speech therapist, but I have never been involved in this, nor has the therapist asked how he is doing at home. His speech development plan was very limited and basic, and never changed.\r\nI just feel that the SALT service is very limited to the point of \"why bother?\" I'm not sure my son has benefited from such minimal input, and its just very insulting and frustrating. If your therapists lack confidence in autism, then it suggests a clear workforce development need.\r\nAlso there needs to be more honesty about what your service can realistically offer. In addition, parents and carers need to be involved in assessment and ongoing review otherwise there's a big chunk of corroborative data missing from assessment. Also make the service more easily accessible and user-friendly.\r\nI wouldn't recommend it to anyone in the current state - and quite frankly I felt very let down by the whole experience.", "I have been 'cared for' by a psychiatrist for many years and I feel that they have misdiagnosed and mistreated me and have abused their position by misusing antipsychotic medication in my care plan. I also feel that they have been inappropriate with me, which has had a big impact on my life.\r\n\r\nI have been on antipsychotic drugs throughout the years of what was in my opinion dreadful care. The side effects of these drugs has been significant. I have tried my best to get away from this psychiatrist. I have reported them to Gwent Healthcare 3 times, most recently in 2008, but I feel I've been blocked.\r\n\r\nI've had no response back, I've had to continue with them. I've made a complaint to the health board too. They've now agreed to look into all complaints. I've been transferred back in October 2008, to a psychiatrist who is much better. My antipsychotic meds were discontinued in November 2009. I'm now fully well alive again.\r\n\r\nI've seen 2 other consultants psychiatrists since then, I've not needed a treatment order. I believe the psychiatrist I was under for all those years had no respect for vulnerable patients. I believe their top priority was them self, not their patients. \r\n\r\nI just have one appointment left, an after care assessment, to be fully released. I feel this person is not to be trusted and is unfit to practice. All the other docs and CPNs have been excellent, dedicated and helpful.", "I had a total hip replacement at Southmead Hospital and was subject to constant commentary from some of the staff and a few of the patients in the ward, which I believe was racist.\r\nThis went as far as on the actual wound the bandaging was very thick and I repeatedly asked the nurse to do something about the pain. She insisted it was normal and refused me for 2 days to see the doctor.\r\nAfter those 2 days I myself realised that the bandaging was what was causing all the pain. I insisted then that it be removed and the theatre male nurse came in and did it. Pain gone.\r\nOne and a half vials of morphine in two days due to this. This nurse said don't worry, normal.\r\nI am a European (Western) who has been in the UK 14 years. I did not come here planning to get sick. I would sooner find myself in Hell than be treated in that hospital again.", "At the end of June 2009 I was taken ill. My legs folded under me and i had no feeling for about half an hour, then i was sick all night.\r\nThe next day i went to my doctor and told all my symptoms that by this time were getting worse. She told  me to go for blood tests and an xray on my neck that had really started hurting.\r\nThe next day i was taken to Colchester hospital. By this time i could not keep awake, I was there for four hours, they could not find what was wrong with me and refused to xray my neck, then sent me home.\r\nMy family got the feeling they thought i was drunk or on drugs but this was not said outright to them.\r\n2 days later they called for an ambulance from Clacton. The ambulance people were rude and my family had to argue with them before they would take me.\r\nOne hour after they came they took me out of the house by forcing me to stand and kicking my heels to make me walk to the ambulance, saying that I would probably be sent home.\r\nAt Colchester hospital they lost my notes for a while. By this time I was out of it and could only say when I needed the toilet. I asked to go and was taken by wheelchair.\r\n45 mins later my daughters found me still on the toilet on my own, asleep. 30 hours later I was transferred to Queens Hospital with a bleed on the brain that was a week old.", "My Nanna died last year, a few days before xmas. She wasn't the healthiest elderly woman you've ever seen, but she was independent and did a lot for herself.  She had problems with her kidneys for a while.\r\nOne day she was shopping around Morrison's, the next my mum finds her ill on the sofa, she left her thinking it's maybe the flu. After 2 hours of no improvement she called an ambulance and got rushed to Chorley & South Ribble hospital.\r\nI can't remember the ward names. She was in an intensive care type ward for about 4 days. She was really really ill. They stopped her food intake because of some swallow test, and she wasn't allowed anything to drink.\r\nShe got moved onto a normal type ward. After 5 days on that ward she was still on oxygen and nil by mouth. 2 more days pass.  Nil by mouth. They only had a drip into her arm. She kept asking for water. But the nurses refused. It was because she had a dry mouth.\r\nThe day I visited she was very ill, and kept stopping breathing. I told the nurses. They replied \"she's deteriorating, what do you expect, go away\". I feel that just because she was old they abused her situation. If I wasn't so upset to basically be told \"let her die\" then I would've screamed in their faces.\r\nShe died eventually. After no food for about 9/10 days.\r\nI believe the reason my Nanna died was because of a lack of care provided by the NHS hospital. I feel they abused my Nanna's rights as a human being, and her rights to eat/drink. I believe it's neglect and emotional abuse.", "Dear Betty123,I am very concerned and sorry to hear about your distressing experience on one of our inpatient wards.

I am so disgusted that my hope is I never have to have another operation at Ormskirk Hospital.\r\nAlso the nurses seem only to congregate at the nurses station rather than observing patients needs on the ward. What an awfull experience it was.", "I took my daughter of 13 months to Whiston A&E after my doctor referred her, as she couldn't walk properly and her knee was hot and swollen.\r\nI sat there for about 2 hours before a doctor saw her. She was then asked to go for a scan and then come back to discuss the results. \r\nWhen i came back with her they said she was fine and couldn't find nothing and she was getting referred to Alder Hey. So i left and waited. \r\nI called 2 days later to find out whether she had an appointment made but they said to phone Alder Hey. I phoned Alder Hey who had no record of an appt to be made.\r\nI then waited another day and finally decided to take her to Alder Hey as she was really distressed and refused to walk or move her leg. Later that evening she was admitted to Alder Hey with a bad case of septic arthritis and we spent a week there.\r\nHow could the doctors in A&E miss this? I am not going to Whiston again, who knows what they could miss next time?", "I was taken to an admissions unit under a section 136. I was there for a total of 6 hours. For the first 3 hours, I sat calmly causing no problems at all waiting to be assessed by a doctor and a social worker. Staff supervised me while I waited to be assessed and in my opinion, I gave no cause for concern. \r\nAfter 3 hours, new staff started their shift. One of the senior members of staff on the unit came into the 136 suite and asked for my shoes which had laces and any property I had. I said I had caused no problems thus far but still handed over my property. They asked if I had a phone. I explained that I had an iPhone and that I didn't feel comfortable handing it over. I explained again that I had not caused any problems for the past 3 hours, that it was not possible to harm myself with a phone, and that, being a \u00a3600 phone, I would not even contemplate damaging it. They began shouting at me, and speaking down to me. At no point did I become violent towards them or raise my voice, which is not what I can say for them. \r\nBecause I would not hand over my phone, they called for the response team which consisted of three males and two female staff. Two men came from behind and held me down. They all held my legs and my arms while one person retrieved my phone. I began struggling, screaming at them that this was not necessary. Even after they had taken my phone, they still restrained me. I continued to struggle. They then began pulling at my trousers. I screamed \"What are you doing?\". My trousers were pulled down to just above my knees. I continued screaming, asking what they were doing. They said nothing. They then held me down to the floor, put my hands behind my back pointing upwards and held me there for a minute, my trousers still around my knees. Then a staff member said \"are we finished?\" and they all let go of me. I immediately pulled my trousers up. The whole restraint lasted about 5 minutes, though they had taken my phone within the first 30 seconds. In my opinion, they enjoyed restraining me and seeing me struggle.\r\nAs soon as the restraint had ended I immediately began to have a panic attack. I have a history of sexual assault and what they had just done, and the fact that my trousers had been pulled down, brought everything to the surface. I began to cry frantically, hyperventilating and shaking. I was cowering in the corner. The staff began to laugh out loud at me. They stayed there for a further 5 minutes watching me in distress and they were laughing. They left apart from two staff who stayed to supervise me. \r\nAfter about 20 minutes I was still having a panic attack, my chest began to hurt, I was having difficulties breathing and hyperventilating, my heart was palpitating and I couldn't feel my hands or feet. I was terrified. I asked the two staff to get a doctor. They replied by saying that I was being silly, and that I was doing this to myself. I begged them to get a doctor.  \r\nThey then said we'll take your blood pressure and vital signs. I screamed at them that I didn't want them to touch me, and asked them again to get a doctor. They didn't. They said I'd been sitting there quietly (which I clearly wasn't), and that I could wait for the psychiatrist. I told them I wanted a medical doctor and told them about the chest pains. I then heard one of them say they needed to cover their backs and they then got the a senior member of staff, the same one who called the response team earlier. \r\nThis member of staff came in and began shouting at me telling me to stop being silly and that the doctor (psychiatrist) was on their way. \r\nI asked for a medical doctor. The member of staff then shouted that they weren't going to get a doctor for me. I was clearly in a state of distress, hyperventilating, shaking and I was clutching my chest as I was having chest pains. They didn't get anyone for me the whole time I was having a panic attack. Despite having two staff permanently with me for supervision, not one person attempted to calm me down. I am amazed that being a mental health facility, not one member of staff tried to minimise my distress or talk to me.\r\nI was in a state of panic for a total of an hour before I began to calm down. A further hour later, I was seen by the psychiatrist still in distress and crying. I explained what the staff had done to me and the psychiatrist said they would investigate it. They knew about my history of sexual assault and understood the distress I was under. They apologised for what had happened. \r\nI was then released from the section 136. When I left the Unit, I cried frantically in the middle of the street. It was a member of the public who actually stopped to ask if I was ok, the first person (apart from the psychiatrist) to show some concern for my distress. This person called a taxi for me and stayed with me until it arrived. The fact that I had just come from a facility which is supposed to help people in mental distress, and that it was a member of the public who showed the care and concern that should have come from the nurses at the Unit, I believe brings shame and disgrace to South London and Maudsley NHS trust.", "I am really sorry that you have been distressed by an experience within our services.

But I was still having disagreements with her nurse who seemed more concerned about my mum becoming dependnet when she only had a few days anyway. \r\nIn my opinion, they failed to provide appropriate care, failed to manage her pain at the end stages, failed to recognise or provide palliative care when appropriate and subjected her to unecessary pain with intrusive procedures which could have been carried out under more appropriate and sensitive conditions which it was after the shambolic attempts at my mums expense. \r\nThat memory of the last two hours when she begged for pain relief to be told by ward Drs that there was no one available to see her and no contingency plans despite being reassured that when the time came she would recieve the drugs to help manage her pain as was her only request.\r\nShe died in agony while ward staff had their hand-over session chatting away while we waited outside that room for a response from the Dr to come to administer some morphine. They could not even give her paracetamol as there was no one available to unblock her intravenous line. The irony being that I had paracetamols in my handbag but she was unable to swallow.\r\nI will never forgive the staff on that ward for their lack of compassion, their ignorance and lack of insight of the very specialism they work in.  We got a stupid letter 3 months later stating they had failed to provide palliative care and for the lack of training the staff had...its no good for my mum is it?\r\nI urge anyone who has loved ones at end stages to arrange hospice care or take them home...i wish i had done so.", "Some time ago I had concerns of a rising PSA(Prostate-specific antigen) blood level , I could not get the treatment I needed where I live in Ireland so I decided to go to London Guy's hospital for a template biopsy which looks at all the prostate for cancer. I had the treatment and returned to Ireland where I waited for the results, a few days later I got a phone call from guy's with the results, I was told I was all clear no cancer. As you can imagine I was very please and relaxed.\r\n\r\nWell time went buy but the symptoms did not go away the PSA kept going up, my GP decided to send me to a specialist in Cork, I ended up having a major operation to remove my prostate, my doctor told me after the operation that they found my prostate to be fully cancerous , you might well ask what happened with the all clear Guy's Gave me , I tried to talk to them about it but they would not talk to me, if I didn't have the operation on the prostate I would not be writing this now..", "My Mother-in Law (MIL), suffering with \u2018End Stage' COPD was admitted to Furness General Hospital through Accident and Emergency (A&E) at the end of October 2010 accompanied by her husband (H) and youngest son (YS)\r\nYS found A&E to be very busy to the point where staff were unable to have many of their requests acknowledged, hence lengthy waits for essential monitoring and tests causing unnecessary distress to patient, family and staff, WHY? MIL was in a heightened state of confusion which could have been avoided had one of the Family been allowed by her side, YS and H were becoming increasingly anxious and upset as neither were allowed to be with my terminally ill MIL until after a lengthy time in the waiting area YS insisted. \r\nMIL was eventually admitted and settled onto the Medical Assessment Unit (MAU) in the early hours of Saturday morning.\r\nAt approximately 10.30 the next morning. H received a phone call from a member of staff to inform and prepare him for the shock he was to receive, my MIL had fallen out of bed and sustained a nasty injury to her neck, WHY ? Upon visiting, the Family were very distressed to see the result of the fall and were becoming increasing concerned over her welfare as it seemed to them that the ward was very short staffed. WHY?\r\nThat evening MIL was transferred to Ward 6 accompanied by H, eldest son (ES) and myself, we waited quite a while in the patients lounge whilst the staff settled her in. When we were allowed to her bedside, I was very disturbed to see the call bell still in place on the wall, out of reach, WHY? I immediately placed it on the bed within reach. The Family were very reluctant to leave and shared our concerns particularly of MIL's confusion with a nurse, who assured us they would keep a close eye on her.\r\nHaving witnessed serious failings in care afforded to my late Mother and a subsequent 3yrs to reach the end of local resolution complaint, I was, as may be expected, anxious to see this would not happen again. Whilst visiting on the third day I happened to read the Risk Assessment and was extremely concerned to read \u2018No signs of confusion' WHY? This surprised and shocked us as MIL suffered with short term memory loss and was in a constant state of confusion! I spoke to a member of staff regarding my findings and the following morning telephoned the Complaints department informing them of my concerns, arrangements were made for H and myself to meet with Elderly Care that same afternoon, our concerns were listened to, the meeting was productive, a laminate card with instructions was provided within hours and MIL was moved nearer to the nurses station as per our wishes, an investigation into the fall was also promised, as yet we have not received any feedback on this. WHY?\r\nUnfortunately, the Family felt very uneasy and reluctant to leave MIL, we perceived the ward to very short staffed. On numerous occasions drinking needs were not met, WHY? Often we found ourselves asking for a beaker and straws as they had not been made available, this is basic care and unacceptable that needs were not met and that the Family were faced with this problem on each visit. \r\nOne evening mearly a week after MIL entered hospital there was a marked deterioration in her condition, whilst we were yet again at the nurses station requesting drinking aids! WHY? H and myself were informed MIL was very poorly, had been diagnosed with Pneumonia the previous Monday, this was the first time any of the Family had been informed of the diagnosis WHY? Therefore it was a shock to read the POTTS at 20.00hrs that evening, the last entry of observations was 13.00hrs. Would 8hrs plus seems a lengthy interval for a patient in such a poorly condition? WHY? At the end of visiting, we tried to raise our concerns with the staff unfortunately they appeared to be in the depth of an emergency situation on one of the bays, we lingered for quite a while in the hope of speaking to someone, we felt very uneasy and anxious at having to wait 18 hours until the next visiting time. The emergency situation continued so we reluctantly made our way home with the family deciding to ring the ward first thing the following day to arrange a morning visit, sadly MIL passed away in the early hours without her family around her. WHY?\r\nThe next distressing event was for the Family to be told there was no one available to accompany us to the Viewing Room for 24hours despite being told on our first visit we would be welcome to visit with 30mins notice. \r\nWhy were the Family not offered the services of the multidisciplinary palliative care team? As per Nice Clinical Guidance, according to Doctor Foster hospital guide the Trust does provide a palliative care service.\r\n", "my son was sent to picu newsum centre. I feel that becklin wing didnt take time to properly diagnose him. they sent him to psychiatric intensive care unit at newsum centre which consisted of a bed, toliet, wash basin and grey walls. How can any body get better locked up like they're in a prison cell?\r\nthe first day i went to see him i cried buckets of tears. i couldnt believe a sick person could be locked up like that. it felt to me like he was locked up like an animal in a zoo. \r\nin my opinion, the nurses and doctors treated him badly. my son went to picu with a nervous breakdown and within 3days they had given him so much drugs it seemed to me that he was struggling to string two words together. i found the staff nurses very rude. \r\nmy son suffered many injuries while he was in picu. i got the police involved. i think picu should be abolished and new staff and doctors appointed.\r\nfrom an angry mother \r\n\r\n ", "My name is Janice Morris and I'm the Clinical Services Manager with overall responsibility for all adult inpatients within the Trust.\r\n\r\nI'm really sorry to hear that your son has been so unwell, and I'm equally sorry that you've not been happy with his care on our Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) ward.\r\n\r\nIt sounds like there's been a lot going on in a short space of time, and I appreciate that this has left you upset and angry. I'd like to take a bit of time in this reply to talk about the PICU ward in general, but obviously to maintain your son's privacy and confidentiality I cannot speak about his individual care here.\r\n\r\nI find the things you mention concerning and so I would implore you to get in touch with me through the PALS team so we can either speak over the phone or meet face to face. PALS can be contacted on 0800 0525 790, on email to pals@leedspft.nhs.uk or you can instruct the ward to pass your details to them. They will be more than happy to speak to you and to put you in touch with me directly.\r\n\r\nI'm very concerned that you've not been happy with the attitude of the ward staff and I would like to hear more about this.  Staff on PICU ward are extremely experienced in dealing with people who are acutely unwell and their families, and so I'm very sorry that you felt a member of staff was rude to you. If you can give me some specific details I will investigate your concerns formally with the staff concerned.\r\n\r\nWe know just how important family and friends can be during periods of ill-health and recovery, and we would always want to make sure they felt included in the care we provide as a Trust. Your visits will have been very important to your son and I am saddened that they were not reassuring to you. \r\n\r\nCreating an environment of respect and dignity for everyone we encounter is at the core of our values, and we would always want to maintain a high standard of care for every patient and their carers.  \r\n\r\nI understand that you feel that your son wasn't on the Becklin Centre ward for long enough for him to be fully treated.  Obviously I can not comment on his individual case without his permission, but the decision to temporarily transfer service users to PICU is always done following a full multi-disciplinary review and would only be done to support their ongoing care and safety. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately when some people are extremely unwell, they either need more intensive monitoring, or they can have impulses to harm or injure themselves or others. The PICU ward is better designed to deal with these types of situations than our general wards at the Becklin Centre. It is a locked ward and has been designed as a low stimulus environment; I do accept that this can make the ward seem less open and more sparse than our other wards.  \r\n\r\nThe aim of PICU is to increase safety and reduce stimulation. High levels of stimulation can make people feel more unwell and thus be at greater risk or require more medication \u2013 this is something that we try to avoid. As with any intensive care ward, we want people to be there for as short a spell as possible before being transferred back to an open ward such as in the Becklin Centre, where they are often more comfortable when feeling better. \r\n\r\nVery regrettably you say that your son sustained some injuries while he was on the ward. This is obviously a concern to me and I would like to know more so that I can thoroughly investigate it. Again, it would be helpful if you could contact PALS to help with this.\r\n\r\nAs a mother it must be very distressing to see your son so unwell and unable to communicate with you at such a time. From the information you give it is difficult to explain why this was the case. Both sedation and slurring of speech can be a temporary side effect of the medication used to treat such acute mental health problems and reduce distress. \r\n\r\nIt can be unpleasant both for service users and families but such medication is safe and is given by health professionals so that service users feel more comfortable and make a quicker recovery. I can assure you that such side effects are only temporary.\r\n\r\nI can't help but be worried about how upset this experience has made you, and so as well as talking to me about your concerns about your son's care, I wonder if you would  be open to getting some support from our Carers Team?  \r\n\r\nThey can offer you information and support both while your son is in hospital, and once he's discharged. They can be contacted on 0113 2954445, or if you speak to the PALS Team they can arrange for the Carers Team to give you a ring. \r\n\r\nIt's not clear from your posting where your son is currently, but I'm really hoping that you've already seen some improvement in his condition since posting this.  And even though you've raised concerns that I'd still like to learn more about, I do want to thank you for taking the time to tell us about your experiences here on Patient Opinion.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nJanice Morris\r\nClinical Services Manager\r\nAdult Directorate", "In May of last year I had surgery to cure me of Epilepsy. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately during the operation, there was an accident which lead to a bleed giving me a stroke. I was in the high dependence on Ward N1, and I was ventilated and in a bad state. I was not absorbing the drugs they were giving me.\r\n\r\nI remember seeing my consultant at the window and I remember sticking up my thumb to him.\r\n\r\nI was then taken off the ventilator and I had a grommet inserted.  I vaguely remember moving slowly through the bays towards the Ward main doors, so I knew I was slowly getting better. \r\n\r\nI was then moved onto Ward N2 in the bottom bay and the process of moving down the bays towards the ward main doors. I remember one day when a nurse was sat near me and drinking a coffee I said to her \u201cI'd kill for one of those\u201d so she called for a doctor to take the grommet from my throat. The same nurse brought me a coffee later \u2013 and it was heaven.\r\n\r\nThe stroke had left me in a wheelchair and barely able to walk. But I slowly moved through the bays. But I felt that I needed to be somewhere I could recover and work on my walking and speech.  \r\n\r\nThe staff were brilliant and understood my needs and they were amazing, they managed to find a place where I could do this. Nurse Pierce, the surgery nurse was amazing, and showed constant support. The one conversation I had with her was when I was being wheeled off the ward to go get the taxi to go to the respite unit, was she asked if I'll be ok, and my answer with absolute determination \u201cI won't let this me beat me\u201d\r\n\r\nI was in N1 and N2 for about 3 weeks.\r\n\r\nDuring my time in the respite centre my ability to walk returned and my speech also started to return, although I needed the occasional support of a speech therapist.\r\n\r\nI remember the follow appointment I had with my consultant, Nurse Peirce was also there. And I marched into the appointment with my head held high, and be able to do that felt so amazing. I think both were surprised. They told me \u201cthey were not sure what to expect\u201d. My consultant explained to me what had happened during the operation, and there was a sincere regret in his voice. As I left the office I remember turning to Nurse Peirce and saying \u201cI told you I wouldn't let it beat me\u201d and she smiled and said \u201cyou certainly did\u201d\r\n\r\nThe surgery hasn't completely stopped the seizures, they are way less regular than they were before the operation. Even for this I am grateful as they now longer have such a big impact on my life. \r\n\r\nFor this I would offer my most sincere thank you to my consultant, for the life changing surgery, and to all the staff on Wards  N1 and N2 who cared for me, the nurse got me that Coffee, and the nurse who took me to the respite centre, not that I wish to belittle the work of all the other staff, far from it.\r\n", "I am sorry to hear of your experience with the Ambulance Service and we would welcome the opportunity to discuss your concerns.Please consider contacting me, Marie Tideswell, Regional Head of Patient Experience on telephone number 01384 246366 or by [email](mailto:complaints@wmas.nhs.uk) .", "Firstly, please accept my sincere condolences for the sad loss of your husband.

For example, sickness levels have been reduced and we have seen a steady reduction in vacancies meaning less reliance on agency staff; the dedicated breastfeeding support midwife has been appointed; the ward has been completely refurbished over the past year, thus improving the physical environment. We will contine to monitor standards and respond to feedback from women using our service, in order to ensure all women receive high quality care.\r\n\r\nLynne Pacanowski, Director of Midwifery and Head of Gynaecology Nursing", "I went to Chase Farm for a nose manipulation operation. I felt the doctor who performed first my examination and then my operation was pretty ignorant. I told him what the damage was to my nose and I tried to show him. He insisted that the damage to my nose was limited to what was written in the A&E initial assessment.\r\n\r\nMy nose was broken and they insisted it wasn't.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say the operation was a failure. After wearing a splint for a week after the operation, when I took it off my nose sprang back to the way it was before the operation.\r\n\r\nI went to my doctor and asked for a change of hospital to another hospital. She recommended Wittington hospital. I went for my assessment. The doctor confirmed that my nose had indeed been broken. And I am now waiting for my operation.\r\n", "Back on the evening of October 2nd I broke my wrist on the tube in central London. My back was facing the door and somehow the opening door caught my elbow and jammed my forearm into my wrist (my hand was holding onto one of the poles). It popped three times, and I had to wedge it out as the door was still trying to open.\nA few days later (October 5th), I went in to the doctor (not knowing it was broken at this point). She looked at it and had me move it and declared it not broken. On November 5th I went back in to the doctor, because it still hurt, and it definitely wasn't getting better. Off for x-rays I was sent (out to zone 4 hospital Queen Elizabeth, I live in zone 2). Verdict: not broken. Fast forward to December 16th; my wrist still hurts. My doctor finally decides it's time to send me for an MRI to see what kind of damage is going on. I ask when and am told \"sometime in the next month.\" Oh, boy.\n\nFollowing the advice of some friends I went into the A&E. After being annoyed at me and snapping at me for not going back to the same hospital I had my first x-rays taken at the nurse sends me off to get more x-rays. I had gone into Guys Hospital having been told by my tutor at Uni that they were quite good. They were much more thorough... but still didn't find anything \"wrong\". I was told they couldn't do anything and it was up to my doctor to do anything further.\n\nFinally on January 13th (over 3 months after the initial injury, at which point it should probably be healed), I went in for an MRI at Guys Hospital. By the Friday afterward (the 21st) I haven't heard back about the results, so I call in. And guess what, my wrist is broken. My doctor sends a letter marked \"urgent\" to the hospital to arrange with me an appointment in the orthopaedic department. By the next Tuesday I still haven't heard anything so I call my doctor and the hospital. The doctor says that they sent the letter and there is nothing they can do. The hospital says that it doesn't matter if it's marked urgent or not, getting an appointment will take 12-14 weeks (maybe I just caught an angry receptionist?). My friends convinced me to take a chance at going to A&E again. This time they were nice to me, in fact amazing, because I was a mess. You see, I'm a dancer, and a foreign student, so I'm also not dancing fully and not sure how to go about dealing with healthcare here. This was at St. Thomas' Hospital. They said the break was so old that they couldn't do anything. That it really shouldn't be taking this long, and I should keep bothering my doctor until things are figured out.\n\nOn February 11th I still hadn't heard anything about even arranging an appointment. After calling my doctor and the hospital twice (each) in one hour, I finally found out that someone lost my paperwork. I also finally started hearing some disbelief from people as I tell them my story. I finally convinced someone to do something: they promised to fax the \"urgent\" letter again. Oh, and my wrist is still hurting at this point, not getting any better... there's a possibility it's getting worse.\n\nA week agoI received a letter from the NHS saying they've scheduled me for an appointment tomorrow. My wrist still hurts nearly five months later and I'm hoping there isn't irreparable damage.", "I have a story about the Maternity Unit at Queens Hospital in Romford Essex.  I have been unfortunate enough to have been subjected to bad experiences twice in 2 years now at Queens. \n\nIn 2008 I had my first child by emergency C-section. I was planning a nice calm home water birth, but my waters broke and no labour progressed, so I presented at Queens hospital in Romford, as my baby was at risk of infection.\n\n I was induced twice with peccaries.  Then I was left in an out-patients waiting room full of expectant mothers for 20 minutes in my nightwear and in labour whilst I awaited a scan to see how much water was around my baby.  I felt this was embarrassing for myself, my husband and the awaiting out-patients. There was no fluid around the baby.\nI endured an excruciating 14 hour labour before the medical staff realised that my pelvis was too small to deliver.  From what I understand the reason that they thought I was ok to deliver was because my feet were a size 5!  My baby nearly died during this time.  \n\nDuring the labour I was given 2 Epidurals. I begged for hours for the first Epidural which when finally administered, was inserted incorrectly, my leg shot up in the air involuntary and the pain never went away.  Both my husband and I were scared as we knew that this was a dangerous situation. The anaesthetist seemed to be panicking, they shouted at me and left the room quickly.  Even though I communicated that the epidural was not working to medical staff many times, lt was left that way for 4 hours before being corrected.  I was in extreme agony and was being internally examined on a regular basis.  \n\nThen a male student came and asked to observe.  My husband told him strongly that he could not.  I was astonished that in such a sensitive situation I would be asked if I could have spectators.  My husband tracked down the anaesthetist and found him taking casually with a nurse, he had strong words, which was when he made a reappearance.  \n\nThe second time, the Epidural was inserted correctly.  I was given a drip to induce again when I was fully dilated, as my baby would not descend.  My baby's heart-rate dropped and I signed a form for an emergency C-Section.  During the operation, I was conscious.  I was violently sick over the scrub nurse, as she told me that I was not going to vomit and did not get a bowl in time.  I was aware that my blood pressure was dropping, as I was losing a lot of blood.  I could hear a panicked conversation by the surgical staff.  All I could worry about was whether my baby was alive.  After my daughter was taken out, (she was ok), I started to feel pain, which was getting worse.  My uterus was on the outside of my body as I had lost a lot of blood.  I knew this, as one of the surgical staff had told me.  This was terrifying to know, as I was feeling the pain worse and worse.  My husband and I were both panicking. I felt  my husband was mislead to get him out of the operating theatre by hospital staff.   I finished off on gas and air as I was put back together and stitched up.\n\nDuring my stay I felt I received atrocious after care from the midwives. I was actually insulted by one of them. I felt  she scolded me for asking for painkillers and for trying to talk about my ordeal.  The midwife told me that I was not the only woman to have a C-Section and that I was not the only one that needed painkillers.  She also made a comment about my husband which disturbed me.  I told her that my husband had skin to skin contact with my daughter.  She told me that was only for the mother and asked me if my husband had undressed my daughter.  I felt like she was accusing him of something.\n\nI had trouble breastfeeding due to the distress and discomfort.  The breastfeeding midwife merely pushed my daughter to my breast again and again until my daughter and I were both crying.  I asked her to stop, she kept trying, and after this method was not working she left us alone.  (I managed to breastfeed when I got home with the help tot my community midwife).\n\nI complained to PALS but I felt fobbed off. \n\nMy daughter had a dent on her head when she was born where she was pushing against my pelvis bone due to the violent contractions caused by being induced.  This evened out with breastfeeding.  She has had no further problems.  I had nightmares for a while about the surgery.  I felt quite depressed for a while and suffered mild sciatica, which I managed with hot baths and over the counter pharmacy medications.\n\nI had another child in January 2010 by Elective C-section. My son was so big that I nearly went into spontaneous labour twice before my C-section date. My local midwife told me to rest for 2 months before my due date, as there was a danger of going into labour.  I suffered pelvic pain and abdominal pain and could not bear to lie down, so I slept in a chair for the last 2 months of my pregnancy which was very uncomfortable.  I was told by a Junior Doctor at the antenatal clinic in the Hospital that I would probably be considered for a Vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC) if I presented in labour. This caused me considerable distress.  Then my actual consultant wanted to bring the date of the operation forward by 1 week because of the risk of going into labour before the operation date, but the Maternity Matron would not fit me in.  I was taken into a side room to calm down as I was crying in view of other patients.  \n\nI luckily was able to hold onto my baby until the date of the operation.  On the day, my bloods were lost 3 times, delaying the op further.  2 other patients went before me, I was supposed to be the first of the morning.  I had an Epidural and Spinal. The surgery was fine, but my back spasmed violently afterwards.  I was in considerable pain and was only given pracetamol.  When I asked a midwife for something stronger, she told me I had a low pain threshold.  When I saw the doctor he gave me codine.  I felt that I, again, received bad aftercare from the midwives who treated me during my stay. On one occasion I was felt bullied by a member of staff was and physically pulled out of bed to empty my catheter bag in the toilet. I was not ready to walk and was awaiting my dose of painkillers.  As this was against my will, this to my mind amounts to assault. I told her that I was not ready, but she made me do it by physically pulling me out of bed and across the room.  She told me she had to do this due to guidelines.\n\nI got the impression that the hospital was short staffed, another patient and I tried to help each other when we could.  I was left with  blood and urine in my bed for 24 hours. (My catheter leaked twice from staff failure to empty even though I communicated that this needed doing and my maternity pad was not changed).   \n\nOne night there was only 1 midwife on duty, between 8 C-section patients.  She told us that we had to do everything for ourselves, as she was the only one there.  Luckily the dayshift midwife had not gone home yet.  I spoke to her about this and told her that I was not happy.  She made some phone calls and got 2 agency nurses for us.  Despite this, I still felt neglected at times, as there was an emergency that night. \n\nI could not feed my baby or even pick him up as my back was spasming and I could not risk dropping him.  The nurses would not help as they were too busy.  Another patient limped over and handed my son to me.  He was crying because he was hungry.  I tried to breastfeed him, but I could not due to pain and stress, so he had to go hungry.  I comforted him and slept with him in my bed until morning.  (I managed to breastfeed when I got home, but only for 2 weeks as the distress affected my milk flow).\n\nI complained again to PALS in 2010 about my second stay at Maternity, but again I felt fobbed off.\n\nMy local Paper Romford Recorder did a short but fair article on it. It does not contain as much detail as I have given in this summary.  I have copies of my letters of complaints and the letters that I received back from Queens Hospital.\n\nI now have suffered from severe sciatica since the birth of my second child. I also have continuous backache.  I believe that the incorrectly administered epidural in 2008 left me with sciatica and the further spinal and epidural in 2010 aggravated the problem further.  I will receive Physio Therapy and I get prescribed strong painkillers, (which leave me drowsy at times).  The sciatica is unpredictable and I dread it as it is more severe every time.  It goes from my lower back, through my buttock, leg, ankle and foot, leaving the left side of my foot and toes numb. It lasts for around 2 weeks.  This renders me unable to walk when it is at its worse and I can only lie down.  \n\nI also suffer from depression, partly post-natal and partly to do with a build up of pressures over the past 2 years.  I was even depressed during my second pregnancy.  I believe that the way that I was treated in hospital at both births in 2008 and 2010 has very strongly contributed to my depression.  I have anxiety.  I am prescribed Prozac for the depression and Diazapam for the anxiety.  The diazapam also works for my back.  I am on a waiting list for counseling. Thankfully, I have a very good GP, whom I hold in high regard. .\n\nAt my son's 8 week check with my GP it was noticed that my son's movements were jerky, shaky and he seemed to be very random in his movements.  He was under a peadiatrian for a few months.  I was worried that he had been born with brain damage due to the stress during the pregnancy, as the problem seemed to be neurological.  He eventually caught up and his motor movements are absolutely normal now.  I believe that he was probably born stressed out, as studies have shown that the stress hormone cortisan can cross the placenta if the levels are high and consistant.  He is also now believed to suffer from asthma. I have asthma medications for him and he will receive blood tests.  I am now reducing his dairy intake to see if that makes a difference.  He is under the vigilant care of my GP and a peadiatrician..  I will always wonder if the fact that I could not breastfeed my son due to stress has contributed to this and also the fact that I suffered considerable stress during my pregnancy with him.\n", "My mother, aged 97, had some breathing difficulties but was able to sit in a chair, although not able to walk to the toilet.  When I came in, she was very distressed, saying in the morning she asked for a bed pan but no one came and she eventually wet the bed, and was told off.  She said it happened to others on the ward.  \n\nWhile I was there, she became anxious saying she needed to 'do a poo'.  I asked for a nurse or anyone who could help me lift her onto a bedpan, but was told no one was available.  I tried on my own but couldn't lift her.  She was so distressed, jigging her legs up and down, trying not to go in the chair and trying not to cry.  I asked for a nurse again and walked to other areas trying to find someone.  I went back and held her hand, saying someone would come soon.  After about another 5 minutes, she couldn't hold it any longer and had diarrhoea in the chair.  She was so distressed.  I went yet again to the nurses station, where a group of nurses were chatting.  One then came straight away, saying\"what have you done?\"  \n\nI can't believe what happened next.  She was taken into the bathroom next to her bed, and literally stood naked while she was hosed down by a male nurse.  He said it was the only way when patients cannot get into a bath, but this is a lady who was born in the Edwardian time.  I cannot describe her huge distress. She died the next day.\n\nQuite apart from the huge distress that will never leave me, surely more time is taken up to deal with cleaning up patients, changing beds etc.\n\nI would just like to add that many nurses did work so hard. I think it was just (more than) a few bad apples let them down.\n", "Before Hospital arrival\nDuring my pregnancy I was diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes and was under specialist care at the Queens Hospital. I was made aware that due to this when I do eventually go into labour my baby and I would be closely monitored. Special care would also be provided as there were concerns about the baby coping with control of their sugar level after birth.\nOn the on night toward the end of September 2010 my waters broke (this was around 2am.) My first reaction was to monitor the contractions as this was my third pregnancy and my previous were quick births. I decided to call when there were about 5 minutes apart. I contacted the hospital to make them aware of my contractions. I also told the individual on the phone of the specialist care I was under. I queried if I should come in, I was told to make my way there.\nIn the Triage room\nWhen I arrived I went to the reception area, she took my notes to book me in and directed me to Triage. When my husband and I came into the Triage there was no visible person present. We came further into the room and a young woman in uniform came forward and we told her our names and she told us to place our notes on the table and take the bed towards the door. I was under the notion that as I had called ahead the monitor for the baby as well as the bed would be set up but that was not the case.\nAfter awhile I was then internally examined, but there appeared to be uncertainty in the midwife's capability as it took her some time to come to a decision as to the dilation of my cervix. When she eventually made a decision she advised that I was between 3 to 4 centimetres dilated and she would transfer us to the labour ward. There was no more mention of baby monitoring. \nThe midwife got up from the bed and walked out of the room. We became concern as we were not aware of any alarm or buzzer, we could use in her absence to summon help in the event my contractions got worse. \nThe Delivery Room\nWhen we got to the delivery room the midwife placed a thermometer strip into my mouth and told us she will go get a Midwife to hand over to. I told her I was going to the bathroom, whilst in the bathroom I overheard the midwife telling my husband she needed to test my blood sugar level. However, this was done by my husband (reading 6.4) and given to her when she returned. She had left the room soon after without us not knowing. We became frustrated by her constant disappearance. \nThis meant that majority of the time we were left on our own. Moreover, my temperature was never recorded, the monitoring and equipment for delivery never manifested. Whilst still in the bathroom I felt the baby head drop. I told my husband because I became very scared as I was a distance from the bed. My husband came out the bathroom and told the midwife who brought us over from Triage that the baby was coming. Her reply was to tell me not to push and left the room. She stated she needed someone to deliver the baby. \nThe baby without me pushing was coming out, as my husband turned around and returned to hold me to assist me to the bed. I realised I would not make it to the bed and whilst screaming tried to lower myself with the aid of my husband towards the floor. I was a distance from the bed (doorway of the bathroom). A midwife never materialised to assist with our delivery.\nIt appears my screaming is what triggered a mass of midwives into the room that were previously unavailable. When they arrived into the room one individual who appeared to be the senior midwife (we assumed this as the other midwives were taking instructions from her) started to shout as to what had occurred. She then turned her attention towards me and started shouting at me to \u201cget up off the floor and don't disgrace myself.\u201d This was only seconds after I had witnessed my child sliding across the floor after hitting the floor. \nHow was this possible, I was sitting on the floor, the baby was on the floor still attached to me and the umbilical cord was not clamp. When the umbilical cord was eventually cut and clamped the senior midwife continued to shout at me to get up off the floor. I was still totally in shock as to what happened to me. I found myself just sitting on the floor unable to move in tears. I had just given birth to my beautiful baby girl on the floor of a hospital ward without any proper professional medical assistance. \nI was eventually assisted up to the bed by my husband and there was a barrage of midwives around the baby. In my opinion the negative attitude of the group of midwives in the room became more outlandish. \nThey made unnecessary jokes about me having the baby on the floor, the sex of the baby as I have three daughters and no son. I was emotionally distraught to the extreme by this time and the continued mentioned of how my child entry was made into the world was overwhelming. More so, the midwife from Triage when asked by the senior midwife what happened she looked in my direction and made it clear that \u201cshe told me not to push\u201d. That was the last I saw of her. \nIt appeared that in the commotion they were not sure as to what time the baby arrived and this was estimated by them as 4:20am. The utensils used to cut the umbilical cord were in question as the correct devices were not laid out. I was utterly aghast that they used my towel from home to clean up the floor and place it in a bag next to the bed.\nI was given the injection to start the decent of the placenta and was checked over by the midwife to see if I needed any stitches. I found her attitude was appalling. I told her what she was doing hurt. She told me \u201cstop complaining it cannot be as bad as pushing out a child\u201d. She then proceeded afterwards to press my stomach. Without warning or explanation of what was going to happen, she then pulled the placenta from within me. I was left in tears after this.\nMy daughter during this time was being cleaned and then placed on me. A paediatrician came in and introduced herself and examined the baby. After her examination she explained to my husband and me that at this stage there were no visible injuries to our baby. However, she recommended a scan be done later in the day to ascertain if there could be any internal injuries.\nThey then all then left the room. A woman came into the room a while later and asked if I needed something to eat. I found here attitude towards me appalling as well. She made clear the toaster was not working and I would have to eat the bread as it is. \nAt this point I was not sure what was to happen next and was never spoken to directly to be made aware. More so, given the aforementioned actions with the baby and the diabetes issues they left me in the room with my husband alone for long periods of time. We were finally moved to the postnatal ward after 10am. \ncommunication did not appear to be paramount. \nThe attitude of all involved left a lot to be desired. The scan that was recommended after our baby was born was ignored by the paediatrician on the postnatal ward. She was adamant the baby did need one. When I relayed my concerns she became upset and said she would speak to her register.\nIn the duration the lady who was monitoring the incident of the delivery came to speak to us. This is the first time the staff on the ward was aware of what occurred in the delivery room. When the scan was done on the Friday, they still continued to doubt the way the baby was born and made clear the scan was a waste of their time.\nIn conclusion, my experience at Queen's Hospital was totally unpleasant. I would sincerely wish many things would change at this Hospital but it appears this cannot happen overnight. Up until I write this complaint no contact was made by the hospital with regards to checkups for our baby. The health visitor assigned also tried to get our 6 weeks check up done at the hospital with a hospital consultant but this has not happened.\n\n", "I would like to make people aware of my situation. I underwent routine sinus surgery last year at a Wirral hospital. Once under anaesthetic the surgeon found limited access to my left sinus cavity.\n\nUnfortunately space was so small i had a massive bleed, but the surgeom carried on working through the bleed, hence, they cut through my eye muscles and nerves, the damage was horrendous and so was the pain. \nI have undergone several reconstructive operations in a Liverpool hospital, but am sadly left with permanent double vision for the rest of my life. My only option is to try and use an occlusive contact lens to black out my double vision, but this has its disadvantages, as can only be used for limited hours per day due to starving oxygen to my eye and the risk of going blind. \nI have asked for patient literature to be changed, but am still waiting, as I think people should be aware of what can happen. \nYes, this is probably a twenty million to one chance of it happening to someone, but it happened to me and I now live with the pain and the frustration. I feel this is all because the surgeon didn't take a step back and from what I understand, continued regardless of the risk. ", "It's a long story so I apologise:\n\nI had injured my knee during a rugby match t the end of October so I was taken to Southampton General Hospital A&E after the match. After seeing triage I was told I could ask for stronger painkillers if needed. Half an hour into waiting I was in pain, husband asked for painkillers we were told to wait 5mins...it took my husband another 2 times to get painkillers taking them about 1hrs to eventually give painkillers. After waiting 3 and half hrs whilst watching others who came in after me and left we were seen to. Had an x-ray but I was expected to make own way when I couldn't walk, husband asked where there was a wheelchair. A nurse replied I don't know and good luck trying to find one they are like gold dust here\", dr looked at it said must have dislocated knee which is popped back & again I was expected to walk out when I couldn't. A nurse stopped the doctor and quizzed him about the x-ray which stated effusion seen in joint, the dr said he couldn't see any fluid. the nurse said \"oh so the x-ray is wrong then\", his reply \"well if it is there it doesn't matter\" she reminded the dr of the procedure and that I would need crutches. The nurse then put me through for physio but recommended going via occu health as it would be quicker. Upon reading the sick note the nurses had asked the dr to do he has put knee sprain!\n\nAfter 3 months of physiotherapy ....the physio finally decided I needed to be referred (something I kept saying), I was reviewed and put on emergency list for keyhole rather than mri as had been messed about for so long. Turns out I had damaged my LCL ligament and torn part of my PL bundle of the ACL with a locked knee for 3 whole months (not to mention the partial dislocated of right shoulder that occurred in theatre & wasn't discovered until day after despite continuously telling the night staff of pain), nor was I happy when I was told I would be in hospital until the knee bends 120degrees to then be released with it bending 90degrees and was told by a nurse that it was costing them \u00a3500 to keep me in per night. A month and a half on from the op I'm only just now managing to bend the knee 120degrees after intensive hydrotherapy & physiotherapy. In total it has cost me 9wks off sick as I was signed off for 2wks before the op due to massive swelling. I've had this injury now for nearly 5months with another outpatient review in 3mnths with a chance it may need a reconstruction later on down the road.\n\nIf this had been diagnosed correctly in the first place I think the NHS would have saved themselves a lot of money as 1) me as a patient and 2) as staff. I'm now considering getting private health to avoid the plunder in future. It also turns out I'm am not the only person to experience the increasing poor treatment and mis-diagnosis of A&E", "Basically, I have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, type 3. My teeth are crumbling. There appears to be no first-line dentists in my PCT who can  treat me - I am told that they expressed concerns that my condition was too complicated, and have also heard those concerns first-hand from two practices. The latest referred me to the dental hospital in Manchester as they felt I would get better treatment there. The dental hospital referred me to Manchester Royal Infirmary's Oral & Maxillofacial department, as they thought it best, given that my condition means local anaesthesia works for me only on very rare occasions, that I be given general anaesthesia for a triple extraction, particularly since I have a phobia of needles.\nThe surgeon I saw at MRI - who did not introduce themselves before they got their assistant to sedate me. They decided that I didn't need general and that sedation and local anaesthetic would be so much safer - despite my trying to tell them that local anaesthetic almost never works on me and I have a history of bad reactions to benzodiazepines. They refused to perform the extractions unless they could use local anaesthetic, and refused to do anything else if they did them at all. \nI felt that every concern I had was ignored and bullied into having my procedure with local - because I'd been waiting two years by this point to have those three teeth removed, as they'd gone very bad and I was worried I might get another infection if they were allowed to deteriorate further.\nHe gave me IV midazolam - which, unusually, actually did sedate me to a point - but I was still aware of the entire procedure, I just couldn't communicate during it. They  then extracted all three of the teeth in question - bracing the pliers against a good tooth to extract a bad one, which loosened the good tooth and left that painful for over a month afterward. This was after my trying to tell them that the collagen in my whole body is defective and my gums can't hold my teeth in as well as most people. My jaw was also dislocated during the procedure and, though they put it back, it hurt a great deal more than usual for the next few weeks.\nThe surgeon left and discharged me without speaking to me again when they were done. I felt they just pushed me onto their assistant, who observed me for an hour then gave me a discharge pack. The assistant said no word about dealing with the fillings; the surgeon said I needed another appointment, or about making another appointment. I was in such agony for the next month - I felt everything during the procedure, and the surgeon also had managed to deform the socket of the upper tooth I had extracted, which left a sharp edge of bone sticking out against my cheek for weeks - that I had to ask my GP to let me double my usual dose of morphine, which usually is something I only do in the days immediately after a full joint dislocation.\nI still don't know the surgeon's name, because I was sedated enough not to remember it when they told it me. I am trying to deal with this situation through PALS, but am still formulating a response.\n", "My father has terminal cancer and is nearing the end of his life, he also has other conditions and ailments hence there is no treatment being given for the cancer.\nHis first visit to BVH was the beginning of October when he was admitted to the ward with swallowing and breathing difficulties. After three days there he still had his own clothes on and had not been changed, not even when he went to have a stent inserted into his throat, and his prosthetic leg had not been removed, consequently upon getting home after dischrage at 7pm his leg smelt terrible and the stump needed dressing by my mother.\nA stent was inserted but no follow up appointment was ever made to access his condition.\nMyself wife mother and my two children visited him the day after on a side ward with 6 patients, this is when my son pointed out that the man opposite did not seem to be breathing, i went to look and he had indeed died, i alerted this to the nurses who had already looked at the patient earlier and they were concerned it had not been spotted and closed the curtains around him and left him, it would seem to me that if a patient on a ward is near to death that they should be moved to a private room.\nIn January he was again admitted with breathing problems, and was then discharged with a needle still in his arm.\nIn February he was admitted to a different ward with a suspected blocked stent and breathing problems and severe headaches.\nHe was accessed to see if the could walk and swallow ok and after been told 6 times that day that they were bringing him home i finally had to collect him at 6.45 at night.\nWhen getting home his sock was soaking and his leg was very blistered, the ward was called and within 20 minutes we had to take him back to the ward.\nThe next day the doctor said that the leg was swollen and said he needed water tablets and was not concerned, but would access him the next day, he did not seem pleased we had brought him back despite been told to take him back.\nHe seemed unwilling to believe that despite them telling us he could walk ok i had to lift him out the car and into a wheel chair as he could not support himself or walk and was very confused.\nThe doctor said that we cannot continue to keep coming back with my father so many times and they may transfer him to a different hospital or even a nursing home.\nI believe this attitude is disgusting towards an elderly dying man.\nThe dates are approx but specific dates can be given\n\n\n\n\n", "Thank you for bringing the treatment of your father whilst in hospital to our attention here at NHS Blackpool. We have contacted the hospital directly on your behalf and asked for a prompt response to the issues you have raised. Your post has also been sent to our Nursing and Quality Team in order that they can discuss the points raised directly with the hospital ward staff. Can we please thank you once again for bringing this to our attention", " I believe that because his surgery was delayed dads bowel died, perforated, he was full of pus and had peritonitis. While waiting for his operation he and I were constantly told he was going in a 'few minutes' 'extra half hour' but it was over 13hrs after he was declared as needing emergency surgery that he actually went.. A few days after surgery while his bowel wasn't working he was on a liquid diet, but on one occasion he was given solid food. So he vomited, took it into his lungs and developed aspiration pneumonia and was very ill.\n\nThe day before he was discharged his wound completely broke open, and it was noted in his chart he might need a drain placed. The next day-no drain- no nothing- he was sent home with this open 5 inch by 2 inch full thickens wound in his groin. The referral to the district nurse for wound care didn't appear to go through and no one came to do his dressing. \n\nHe was doubly incontinent with diarrhoea so the dressing was soaked with urine and faeces. He lost over a stone in two weeks because he couldn't eat the food- I had asked for soft food or a dietary consult but it didn't happen. No one said a word about his discharge problems, the wound, incontinence, that he couldn't feed himself or walk unaided-and he couldn't be left alone. \n\nHe was sent home with 5 incontinent pads and 2 bed 'pads' my son had to go to the 24 hr Asda at midnight ( he came home at 6pm) to buy incontinent pads, pyjamas, towels and bed sheets.- everything we had was soiled . The dirty pads had to sit in the back garden as they can't go out to the dustman. I had to arrange council 'yellow bag' pick up, get the DNA out -who tried to get him sent back to hospital and arrange for my own carers. \n\n5 days later he developed urinary retention -that's why he was incontinent he was blocked and dribbling-and went back into hospital. The district nurse insisted that tissue viability see his wound and maybe place this drain. Tissue viability did and agreed. But as it meant him staying a few days, someone from the original surgical team came up and clipped the wound closed in his bed in the ward during visiting time. He was sent home an hour later. When the clips from this still dirty draining wound were remove it reopened immediately and took a further 9 weeks to completely close. \n\nMy dad was 86, very deaf (and his hearing aid was usually connected up incorrectly by the nursing staff so it blocked his ear completely) and had vascular dementia so had poor memory. I had been his carer for 5 years and I'm a retired nurse. Yet no one ever told me anything about his condition. When I complained I was told by the matron conducting a meeting between me and the staff involved in his care that if I was nurse I should have realised he wasn't fit to go home. Somehow my fathers GP and the Dns thought I had taken him home against medical advice- but he was discharged by the hospital and i was told to collect him. \n\nWhen I went to collect him at the time I was told to, he was soaked with urine; his head and hair, Pj's, sheets blankets and pillow. He was wearing a pad that fell to the floor and splattered urine. \n\nI felt like my complaint ended up not about dad, but what I supposedly did or didn't do. He had 3 admissions -the complaint was about the 1st, wound care second- yet somehow the hospital confused them all and the consultant at the 3rd became involved. This took place towards the end of 2009 and the complaint still is. I've never seen the surgeon who was caring for him at the time I made the complaint about.\nThe whole thing was nightmare- and dad died a bit later from complications of the delay.\n", "Posted on behalf of East & North Hertfordshire NHS Trust:\r\n\r\nClearly the comments posted are very concerning and based on the information provided, we have been able to make contact with the person who placed them.  We did this to make sure we understood more about what happened to their father (this case dates back to 2009), but also how their concerns were handled by the Trust at the time. \r\n\r\nAs with all complaints, we investigated the issues raised in great detail \u2013 including those around treatment delays, discharge arrangements, wound care and continence issues.  All our findings were shared at a meeting between the family and clinical team looking after the patient, the outcome of which was also shared in writing subsequently.  This allowed us to acknowledge that there had been some delays in our initial investigation, for which we apologised at the time \u2013 and have done so since.\r\n \r\nGood patient care is always at the heart of everything we do, which is why we were saddened to discover that the family of this patient is still clearly unhappy \u2013 even after all this time has passed.  We did carry out a thorough investigation two years ago, but unfortunately the family did not consider that our response addressed their concerns sufficiently.  Our offers of further meetings with the Trust's senior doctors and nurses were declined by the family, who instead approached the Ombudsman.   Towards the end of 2010, the Trust was contacted by the Ombudsman stating that its team could find no cause to investigate the family's complaint further and had closed the file. \r\n ", "the paramedics who brought me to hospital were fantastic, 120% professional. \nits a shame they brought me to this hospital, which i have found to be dirty and the staff who treated me were some of the worst medical staff i have ever experienced.\n\ni was admitted to hospital by a doctor who unfortunately went home. it seemed to me that i had had a heart attack. he said it was unlikely but he would have to rule it out and investigate any other causes. he ordered a chest x-ray, an injection a Trop-t test to be done 12 hrs after the event. the doctor went home and unfortunately i was discharged by a rude consultant.  he made insulting remarks saying that i had not had a heart attack therefore he was discharging me, saying that the doctor i had seen before was straight out of med school and that he had 20 years experience and even questioned why i came to the A+E department in the first place. i found his manner disgusting, rude and very offensive. I felt he was arrogant, and he never even asked me how i was feeling or examined me in any way.\n\nto be spoken to in this way by a doctor is outrageous! i was brought in by ambulance, how dare he ask why i chose to come here, i didnt get a choice!\n\ni was refused a second opinion even by a less senior doctor. i was not given any idea what had occured to me at all and they only tested me for a heart attack then discharged me.\n\nafter my experiene, i feel sorry for anyone who has no other choice than to go to this hospital. i found it disgusting, the toilets were not cleaned in over 4 hours.\n\ni have been mis diagnosed in this hospital before on one occasion. i had to be brought back in an ambulance 3-4 days after a doctor had told me there was nothing wrong with me in minors. to be seen by a doctor who was very thorough and diagnosed me with feacal inpactation.

The junior doctors don't seem to communicate to the nurses on the ward, the nurses on the ward are not allowed to call the doctors. The nurses get things wrong, and seem not to know what should or should not be happening with the patient. They are sometimes very pompous and rude if you ask them anything.\nWorse than the lack of care in my friends' ward is the system that has been developed now. Between the HDU and general ward, I am surprised that he is still alive and fighting.  He feels seriously afraid and having seen it for 6 days myself I am not surprised by his sentiment.", "I recently got put into hospital in April 2011 and I came out of hospital 6 days later. \nI stayed in Queens Hospital in Romford on ward Amber B. I'd like to complain as I feel it was such a terrible time.\nMany of the nurses were agency nurses and I found a lot of the ones who treated me terrible. For example they got me out of bed and put me onto the chair, they put my alarm on the other side of the bed where I couldn't reach it. For half an hour I shouted for a nurse and no one came, even though I could see that there was at least 4 nurses at the desk. \nHalf an hour later of calling, a patient came along and I asked him to get a nurse. He called a nurse and she said she would be with me within 2 minutes. Another half an hour later a different nurse walked in. I waited an hour for some medication and I was in so much agony. \nAnother example was that I was on ice therapy and I needed ice on my foot all day everyday until I had my operation but the operation had to be cancelled on a number of occasions because the swelling never went down. The nurses barely changed my ice bag and on one occasion it took them 6 hours to come along and change it. When I asked a nurse why they wouldn't hurry up, they said I was less priority, even though if I never had this operation it could be dangerous. \nAnother example was I accidentally tipped the bedpan over as they only gave me the paper bit of the bed pan and not the plastic holder. I was stuck in a soaking wet bed for half an hour. I pressed the alarm and I shouted and know one came for half an hour. \nI felt some of the nurses were rude to me, on occasions it seemed to take them forever to get my medication. I witnessed some of the nurses being rude to other patients, I saw some nurses get the patients out of the bed and leave them sitting in a chair all day with nothing to do as some of them were rushed in and never had a chance to collect their items. I very rarely had a nurse come in and check on me etc. Some of the nurses were noisy at night time, laughing and shouting. \nSome of the porters were bad too as I broke my ankle and one porter kept bashing me into every door going. \nWhen the alarms were going off, I saw some nurses at the desk just look up and carry on talking. It seemed they were just ignoring the alarms. A lot of the nurses I saw seemed to take their time to get to the patients. I certainly felt a lot of the time like many of the nurses showed no sympathy and spoke rudely to me. \nAlso I think the visiting times are terrible. They were 3-5 then 5-7.30. I'm not even 20 yet and I've never been in hospital before.I had my operation and my mum couldn't come with me and she couldn't stay after my operation because of the times. I was so scared but I felt that the nurses I spoke to showed no sympathy and just let me get on with it.\n", "I had a chronic feeling of being infected after an acute respiratory infection leading to fatigue, blurred eyesight, disturbed sleep, constipation, lethargy and weakness. It felt to me like there was no attempt made to diagnose the problem within the NHS, just antibiotics based upon the assumption that I had a secondary bacterial infection. When this failed, I was prescribed antidepressants, graded exercise and cognitive behaviour therapy. I became significantly worse and was then discharged as being treatment resistant. One private doctor at a private hospital provided medical tests and found several active viral infections, along with an autonomic nervous system malfunction, all of which contributed to my symptoms and supported my belief that the medical professionals that I had encountered in the NHS had misdiagnosed me twice.\n\nIn my opinion, just like other public sector organisations, the NHS is analogous to the classic boat race between Oxford and Cambridge. Both the Oxford and Cambridge teams consist of eight powerful rowers and one coxswain, whereas it seems to me that the NHS team consists of eight coxswain and one person rowing. From my perspective, NHS reforms rearrange the eight coxswain, retain one rower and wonder why it fails to provide an improvement.\n", "My friend has recently been discharged from hospital after needing treatment for bad pneumonia and pleurisy. She is also asthmatic.\n\nJust before Xmas she got a chesty cough and between then and March she was back and forth to her GP and Walk-in centre. She was repeatedly sent home after being told nothing was wrong. \n\nA week before she was rushed to A&E with breathing difficulties she went to the walk in centre in Widnes. \n\nMy friends temperature on arrival was above 40 degrees C and she was extremely breathless. The nurse gave her paracetemol and left her in a room with a fan on to let her temp come down. When my friend explained she was breathless, she was told she was having a panic attack. Eventually her diagnosis was \"viral tonsillitis\" and she was sent on her way being told she'd recover. A week later, the doctor in A&E said that she should have been in A&E sooner with such a high temperature and history of chesty coughs etc.\n\nNot only does this concern me, I have recently also heard of another situation regarding a separate person who I feel could have been saved had he received necessary treatment for a medical condition. \n\nI understand that paracetemol is commonly used to relieve pain and bring down fever; that's fine, if the fever is not too severe and there are no other obvious symptoms. I also understand that time in a cool room may also help bring the temperature down; but I know that a fever indicates infection of some sort. Considering she'd been to and from GP and walk- in with chest infections previously I'm shocked this was not followed up.\n\nFrom this particular case I understand that simply listening to the chest would probably have not picked anything up; this was because the infection was so severe (and had been missed for so long) a solid mass of infection had gathered at the bottom of the lung. However this could have been (and was at A&E) picked up on chest x rays. Infections were left for so long that the right lung partially collapsed. Her lungs were riddled with infection and it took a week of inpatient treatment and painkillers to even start to fight off the infection.\n\nSo, I hope you can see my concerns and I hope that this is taken very seriously. I don't know how my friend would feel about sharing this story with management as part of an official complaint but I'd like to see something happen whether she does speak to somebody or not. The fact that this has happened (twice in the past month that I have heard about) is causing a great deal of concern for me and I am not convinced that the department at the moment is working in a way that protects the health of all its service users. \n\nI feel that something needs to be done and quickly.\n", "Am autistic with mild learning difficulties and multiple non-psychosis mental health issues.\n\nFrequently feel distressed and have been suicidal a lot. There used to be excellent out of hours service for mental health called the Duty Team who you could call on a mobile number.\n\n\nAbout 2 years ago this was scrapped and replaced with the Sussex Mentalhealth line. I feel they are abysmal. Unlike the duty team, they have no powers to refer you to a psychiatrist if you need urgent help or even contact your care co-ordinator. In my experience, they have been useless. They seem to be essentially an extension of the Samaritans but in my opinion, a lot worse!\n\n\nWhen I phoned them about work difficulties, in my view the person immediately proceeded to say that disabled people didn't deserve to have good jobs (regardless of experience and qualifications) and if we expect to have anything more than a minimum-wage job then we were being naive and deserved to be mistreated at work. I felt they also condoned the bullying and mistreatment I had experienced at work.\n\n \n\nEssentially, I felt they were prejudiced against disabled people and I felt they were suggesting that everything was my fault for being disabled and that if I wanted to commit suicide, that was my problem.\n\nNeedless to say I was extremely distressed and this is not what I expected from an NHS mental health service.\n\nI tried calling other services (as I was trying to \"reach out\" which is surely what you're supposed to do when you're suicidal????) like the out of hours GP service and NHS direct but the way the person spoke to me implied that they also felt that if I wanted to commit suicide then to go ahead with it. \n\nI feel that no-one was interested in helping me. I tried calling the Senior Nurse Practitioner who is the person who admits people who are severely mentally ill as I knew I needed to be admitted, but in my opinion they were also useless and said they were too busy to help and put the phone down. \n\nOn a later occasion, this person asked me \"are you in crisis?\". I explained that due to autism and learning difficulties I can't understand abstract concepts so please could they explain what \"in crisis\" meant. They ignored me and said to call back when I was \"in crisis\". Well how can I when I don't know what it means???? \n\nI was told to go to A&E but due to my sensory hypersensitivities because of my autism, there is no way I could cope at A&E and they make no provision for this. Going to A&E would be far to distressing for me and even though A&E staff have admitted that they know this is a problem, I don't know of anyone having done anything about it. I thought of trying to go anyway and getting my bf to support me but was put off by something I read. \n\nI've tried calling social services out of hours line too when I've been suicidal but they just bounce me back to mental health and in my view the people I've spoken to have been very mean.\n\nSo I still have no out-of-hours support despite the fact that I'm no less disabled out of hours then I am during office hours! I am too afraid to even try to call any of the relevant out of hours numbers as I'm scared they'll just bully me again.\n\nThe default way of treating people with autism and mental health issues in our area seems to be to treat us like a nuisance and I feel I've been bullied. Seriously, I feel that's all that out of hours services do. It's disgusting but I don't feel anything changes, no-one seems to do anything about it.\n\nAnd in my view PALS is a waste of public money.  I called them about the bullying and A&E issues. Well, firstly I had to speak to 2 different branches of PALS. One supported the MentalHealth line, even though there was no evidence (as they don't record calls) and they only spoke to the Manager of the MentalHealth line who wasn't even present in the office during the call! \nThe person I spoke to at PALS then said that I had to phone the Manager of the MentalHealthline to discuss the issues even though I'd made clear I was too terrified to contact them after what I felt was bullying and wanted nothing to do with them. PALS refused to help even though their website specifically says they will liaise and advocate on your behalf! This person also said that I would have to make a complaint (which I didn't know how to do due to learning difficulties) and they then said that was my problem and they couldn't help me - but the PALS website specifically says they DO help people with the complaints process. \n\nThe only people who helped were the police and they confirmed that if someone from a helpline did behave in a way that is likely to drive a suicidal person to be more likely to commit suicide or harm themselves that is illegal under the Assisting Suicide act but there was nothing I could do as the MentalHealth line don't record calls so I had no protection or proof of the way they had dealt with me. \n\nAs for the other PAL service who were supposed to be speaking to A&E about how to make it accessible for autistic individuals, they never called me back. I chased them up about a month after my first call and they said they'd get back to me but months later they haven't and I doubt they will. \n\nIn my experience, I feel that being autistic and mentally ill has meant that I have experienced bullying from mental health services. I feel that there is no way for us to protect ourselves. And I feel the PALS staff I have spoken to have been biased and useless and have refused to do the things their service is supposed to do. In my opinion, they're an extension of what I feel to be the bad treatment of vulnerable autistic and mentally ill adults in this area.\n\n", "I am very sorry that you have had such a negative experience of our services.  I am the Deputy Director responsible for the PALS service and I am very disappointed that you did not find our service helpful.  \r\nWe have already offered via Patient Opinion to speak to you in person and I would urge you to take up this opportunity so that we can move things on in a more positive way.

At the age of twelve I spent the night in hospital due to the severe effect of this bullying. The first operation took place in December 2009 and I was to believe that things had gone well. My confidence began to grow and as a student nurse at university I began to excel at presentations and assignments. I no longer lacked confidence in standing in front of my colleagues. \nIn July 2010 I attended a joint appointment at this hospital where the surgeon and orthodontist explained that I could have further surgery to improve the occlusion (I still had an overbite), I agreed even though my family and friends begged me not to. I had the operation in September 2010 and as an inpatient was sent to a clinic to have an assessment post surgery. It was advised I have an x-ray, so I was wheeled off for one and was then transferred back to the orthodontic clinic which was very busy. I was left alone in the dental chair in a room with the door closed for around half an hour and fell asleep. At one point the consultant orthodontist opened the door to offer to partially recline the dental chair but I refused due to the fact that i still felt very sick and sore. (I have spent most of the afternoon and evening vomiting stale blood and had not had much sleep). \nThe surgeon and sidekick came in around half an hour later to explain surgery had gone wrong and showed me a profile picture of my face saying that I had an open bite now and that I could have surgery one week later to correct it. I was wheeled up with a SHO to sign the consent form and to prepare the drug chart for the next week. \nLater in the evening I was discharged home and told that I would receive a letter in the week to confirm the operation. I received nothing so left a message with the departments booking coordinator and a friend took me there the afternoon before surgery was due to take place again. \nWe asked a clerk to ask the surgeon if the operation was still going ahead, what would be done etc. The clerk went off to speak to the surgeon and came back saying the operation was still going ahead and that I should show up at 7.30 the next morning. We asked her to find out if it was okay for me to still take pain relief as I was still in a great deal of discomfort. Again she went off to speak to him and came back saying that this was fine and that the surgeon had said that they were looking forward to seeing me the next day. We left a little bit miffed off. \nDuring the night I emailed PALS with frustration at the lack of information I had been given and explained that I was confused as to what would be happening to me.\nI showed up for surgery again the next morning. The surgeon came and gave a very brief hello and made a joke about deja vu. The anaesthethic came and picked up on my anxiety, I wanted to cry when they asked why I was having the surgery. I just told them that as far as I knew it had been unsuccessful. When I was put to sleep they gave me some magic meds and the last thing I remember saying is \"I feel so happy\". \nI came round in recovery to the worst pain I have experienced in my life. I used foul language and asked the nurse for more pain relief. I sat up in the bed holding my head. She explained that I had already had a disclosed amount of morphine and asked had I taken pain relief before admission. Yes I had. \nIt took some time for me to settle but I could hear the surgeon next to her in the recovery room discussing the fact that Tony Curtis had died and some other things that were in the paper that day. She came to hold my hand and said I was being transferred back to the ward now. \nWhen I was transferred and they had done my obs, I grabbed my phone out of my bag which someone had left on the chair and phoned PALS to see if they had received my email. The person I spoke to kept asking me to repeat myself (not surprising considering the surgery I had just undergone). They confirmed they had not received it. I don't remember much else about the phone call, just that I definitely made it. \nThe morning after this surgery I was wheeled to an appointment with the surgeon and consultant orthodontist and was examined again after having another xray. The surgeon asked the orthodontist \"What can we do to prevent this from happening again\"? while I was in the dental chair and the orthodontist did not answer before saying goodbye to me. \nI left after being discharged and told my family and friends all that had happened. I also told my university as I was shocked about it all. \nI have since put in a complaint to this hospital. I have been very depressed since the incident and have been so upset that when I contacted this consultant orthodontist by email to say I was not happy to return for further treatment (other things happened after the surgery involving having seven mini screws placed in total which I have since discovered from NICE that I should have been given written information in regards to consent and understanding what these were doing. interventional procedures which did not follow nice guidelines around consent. As soon as I went private these were removed immediately by the new team.) I wrote to PALS which my GP advised to be transferred to another Trust as I could not return. This never materialised and I ended up having to borrow money to pay privately for my treatment elsewhere.\nAs it now stands the hospital are aware of what has happened. I received a letter from the chief executive stating that the surgeon states that if i had contacted the surgeon's secretary before my third surgery they would have been very happy to discuss the procedure with me (we attended the surgeon's department and they relayed information via their ward clerk to us, but did not come out or ask us to return). \nThe hospital now states that this surgeon gave me a clinical diagnosis of \"Lax Ligament Syndrome\". They surgeon never once mentioned this. They did ask me to bend my thumb back in July 2010 and asked me whether I could dance. I explained that I did dance sometimes (I should have explained only when I get very drunk). They now claim that as they do not have a policy on consent to operations and signing consent within 24 hours they do not use one. Yet the department of health and general dental council have one as do other trusts. Their protocol is for patients not to drink/drive, make important decisions/ sign legal documents within 24 hours of a general anaesthetic. My colleagues have advised me many times of this and it is on the original letter for my second surgery. \nI am at my wits end with this Trust. We are all taught to give patients the right to make and to be involved in decisions about their healthcare. I was not allowed this right. I feel the Trust's response is laughable and contains lies. Is this really \"High Quality Care for All\"?\n\n", "I don't really know what happened to my daughter, she was admitted to Good Hope hospital at the end of December with suspected appendicitis/cyst on ovary. She had an operation without scanning her and removed a tumour. Very rare, so rare that it took until six days before she died for them to disclose that she had Sarcoma.\n\nMy daughter was then transferred to The Queen Elizabeth Hospital from Good Hope Hospital on an evening. She was admitted and then transferred on the following day (Monday) to the young persons unit. \nShe met her oncologist that evening. They discussed chemotherapy with her and decided to start it on the Wednesday. The Oncologist told us that best case scenario was 3 years if it worked, 12 weeks if it didn't. \n\nOur daughter started chemo at in the evening of the Wednesday. On Thursday morning when I entered her room her drip was off. I asked a nurse who told me it had a battery and she was busy with a patient. \nI waited another hour and approached the senior nurse who looked panicked and ran straight into my daughter's room. They said that she hadn't been re-attached since she had been taken to the toilet during the night. She apologised and said that this would not happen again.\nOn the Friday, the Oncologist came and said it was pointless to continue treatment and that my daughter had days left. She died 6 hours later in a most distressing manner. \n\nI have been advised to ask for the clinical pathways of my daughter's case from her first admission to Good Hope until her death in Queen Elizabeth. \n\nI believe the treatment my daughter received in Good Hope Hospital was appalling. However when I approached them they have adhered to Government requirements on times to deal with complaints. I don't really want to discuss the appalling care she received in Good Hope as they are investigating my complaint. \n\nQueen Elizabeth however have not even had the decency to offer condolences and have not given any time frames. Their response has been that nurses and doctors are very busy treating patients and when they have time they will get back to me. In my opinion, not checking for mistakes that may have taken place and continuing on the same path is arrogant and unbelievable. \n\nI do not want a response that requires me to contact a machine linking me to PALS which is the standard and I think inappropriate response on the swift death of my young daughter. \n\nI feel it is so understandable the people in our position choose litigation.\n", "Hello again,\r\n\r\nWe would like to help but because of the way Patient Opinion is set up we don't know who you are and so we can't respond to any of the specific detailed comments that you have made.

I made a request, which was not answered and I was shut in a room. I banged on the door asking the staff to answer my request and they sectioned me instead.\nI have not had the opportunity to phone my family. They wanted me to give them the number first which is personal information.\nI feel that I am cheated by the nurses as when I am well I am confident but when I'm unwell I'm reclusive. I come to the nurses to talk when I am well and it feels to me that they don't want to be talked to and say it is because I am being too boisterous.\nI also believe that I am being given too much medication.\nI am very unhappy that I only have an hour to get my things from home as it will take me more than an hour so it means I can't get most of my things. ", "My father was admitted to the Queen's medical centre hospital at the beginning of April  after a fall. He was later transferred from A & E to the admission ward. It was a nightmare situation from start to finish for him and his family.\nWhen we came to visit him the next day. The following was noted.\n* The staff seemed unaware that he is registered partially sighted; very hard of hearing and that English is not his first language.\n* He had not been given any dinner, not one nurse we spoke to could explain the reason for this. We can only assume that when (if) they had asked what he wanted, he had not heard or not understood them and they took it to mean that he did not want any.\n* It seemed that his sight and hearing problem were not taken into account. When medication was given to him, the nurse did not stay around to make sure that he understood that one was in tablet form and the other in liquid form. He could not see the tablets and did not realise there were three of them therefore dropped two on the floor. If I had not been there, would the nurse have even noticed being as she simply had gone on to the next patient? He thought the liquid medication was in tablet form and spilt it over himself. \n* I asked for an interrupter to be provided for him, the nurse said she would inquire but an interrupter never materialised. Despite lots of leaflets always advising that interrupters could be provided, not at any stage were we offered one not even when we asked.\n* My father needed to use a urine bottle, but it took the nurse so long to bring it that he wet himself. His hospital gown was changed but then left on the food tray along with the urine bottle, which he went on to use. Not one nurse bothered to remove the soiled hospital gown or urine bottle, they were simply left on his food tray. I would have removed it but was not sure what to do with it, pour it in the sink? Put the dirty gown in the bin? Or was there a special bin for these things? So I asked a passing nurse to remove it, she said she would come back for it, but she did not. \n* The supper plates arrived and still the urine bottle and soiled gown remained on the tray. A nurse removed the urine bottle just before putting the plate down. Therefore with one hand she was handling a urine bottle and with the other food. But she left the soiled gown on the food tray.\n* Under the hospital bed, my brother found a syringe, an empty crisp packet, and a piece of green material.\n* On the corridors near the wards there was a dirty surgical glove laying on the floor, a bit further along another glove was just lying there. And piled up just outside the entrance doors to the ward a stack of mattresses were leaning against the wall. Various boxes and other bits and pieces were also on the corridors. \n* In the evening he was due to be transferred to another ward. He was told to get in a wheelchair. The nurse made no attempt to help him out the bed or into the chair. An 87-year-old man, unstable on his feet, who had sustained a head injury, who cannot hear well or understand, was just left to get on with it. Once in the chair, there came the decision that he was not to be sent on the other ward just yet, and he was left in the wheelchair by the bed. Some time later he was told to get back into the bed again. No assistance was offered from the medical staff. We, his family, had to get him out the chair and into the bed. Later he was asked again to get in the wheel chair but the nurse had not even put the brakes on it and he almost landed on the floor. We had not been there I feel he may have sustained a more serious injury than the one he came in with! \n* In the space of half an hour, his medical notes were lost a total of three times. \n* There seemed to be a lot of nurses on the ward, all seemed busy and stressed but did not seem to be doing much.\n* He was then moved to ward 49. We requested that they wrote above his bed, next to his name, that he was partially sighted to make staff award of his situation. Our request made several times went unheeded. My father was so unhappy with the way he had been treated, that he was ready to walk out the door and find his own way home. The whole experience had left him very distressed.\n* My father suffers from Glacoma, and has to use eye drops daily, and I was seriously concerned that the staff showed so little awareness of the importance of him taking these drops. They were locked away, but because his English is so poor, he found it very difficult to explain to the nurses that he needed his drops. \n* On being discharged, no one asked if he had anyone at home to care for him, there was no referral to social services to check up on him. He could have been going home to a cold house with no one to care for him. No inquires were made about his welfare at home. They did not even tell us when he was to go to have his stitches out. \n* I made notes of all I saw there and completed a comments card. To this day I have had no feed-back from the hospital management about my comments. \n* Our experience of Queen's Medical centre was a nightmare from start to finish.\nWe experienced poor standards of hygiene and a big lack of communication between various staff members during my father's time at QMC\n", "Dear 'note938', \r\nThis is a message from the Lead Nurse for Adult Inpatient Services:\r\n\r\nWe are very sorry that you have had this experience.

I was 'observed' twice in the entire time I was there, and I discharged myself. \nI was told to do a 24 hour urine collection. I handed it in and went back for my results. I was informed that they had lost a giant bottle of urine between that ward and the lab which as far as I am aware is just downstairs, so they made me do another one. I went back for the results, still no results.. and when I went back again, they had miraculously found the 1st collection! \nThey confirmed to me that I had pre-eclampsia and that they wanted to start inducing me (at the start of september). Late on the night my induction was booked, I was taken to the delivery suite to have my first induction. The delivery suite were fantastic, I couldn't fault it. \nMy partner was kicked out when I was sent back to the triage ward despite the fact my contractions had started. I was pacing the halls in agony all night, not offered any pain relief because as far as I was aware there was no midwife on the ward what so ever. I saw women giving birth on the triage ward assisted by other patients because the midwives were not available.  \nOne midwife who did eventually turn up shouted at another patient when she told her she needed to push - she said it wasn't that bad, told her to stop crying and that she didn't need to push. The midwife took her gas and air away from her, gave it to another patient and then she left, regardless of the fact the poor woman was pushing her buzzer! \n20 minutes later the lady's baby was born, she was assisted by two other patients and as far as I know she received no pain relief. \nI eventually had my son via c section in mid September, after alot of begging and pleading with my consultant.

I had no choice really, I was contracting, but not dilating, and not once was I offered pain relief. \nI found the post natal ward awful. I was expected to know everything about parenting, and when I asked a question I felt like they treated me like I was a burden because they had to show me what to do or answer my question. \nI will definitely not be going back to Lister to have my 2nd.

Several members of staff, dragged me into a cell (or isolation room as they call it), held me down on the floor and injected me twice with sedatives into my bottom, and left me alone all night locked in this cell, on a mattress on the floor!\nI feel I didn't deserve that at all, I was non violent just intensely upset.\nI was kept in for another week and had to sign my child over to their father (who had been absent from their life for months) until they deemed I was able to cope again.\nI would be weary of being 'presuaded' to voluntarily admit myself, as I am now aware that in my case it was not as cut and dry as they made out and I feel now that my future and freedom is in their hands. \nIf I didn't take exactly what meds they told me to take, didn't eat when they told me to, and actually had an opinion, I got threatened with a section, and faced being detained for months away from my family.\n Even though this happened months ago to me, and I am now ok, they contacted social services and child protection services who won't leave me alone, despite the fact I live in a lovely house with my child, am in a secure relationship and it's been proven my child is very stable and happy.\nI feel that once they have flagged you with 'mental health' issues after an admission, you are on the system for ages and can't escape.\n I know as I am pregnant and suddenly had an inspection from social services to ensure I'm mentally capable to look after my child when they arrive. I feel like I have no say in my future, and all this comes from 'doing the sensible thing' and seeking help.\n ", "Thank you for your comments.

", "I witnessed a staff nurse trying to push a plastic syringe ( no needle) into the pateints mouth so that some medication could be squirted in.  The pt was resisting and the nurse said \"Come on ,come on, she's clenching her teeth.\"  The pt did not want the medication because it made her sick  and the pt had been vomitting all afternoon, the vomit bowls were there containing bile stained vomit. The pts daughter tried to intervene to no avail.  The pt was forced to swallow the contents of three syringes which exeeded the prescribed dose knowing it would make the pt even more ill.  \n\nImmediately prior to this event the staff nurse had asked the daughter about the pts gall bladder, recognising the stained vomit and appearing to understand  that the pt was having gall bladder \"attacks\" due to obstruction.  \nThese attacks cause severe pain and nausea.  \n\nThe pt died two weeks later having become skeletal in appearance, being unable to eat or drink and continually forced to take diet and medicaton which did not suit her and caused vomiting and also threatened if she did not comply.  The extent of the vomitting was never acurately reported in the notes and the consultant said it was insignificant.  The dietician who prescribed the medication and diet had been told twice about the gall bladder problem by the pt and daughter but the dietician denied all knowledge of this and said she was never made aware of the vomitting. \n\nThe daughters concerns made to all staff and the dietician and the consultant were never heeded or recorded in the notes .  The pt died  in agonising pain two weeks later from \"old age\" and the daughter could get no more information about the exact cause of death.  There had been more incidents in the 3 week admission and the daughter, having worked in health and social care for 30 years as a registered practitioner made complaints to the hospital, Nusring and Midwifery Council and Health Professions Council.  She wondered if the pt had suffered a ruptured gall bladder as a result of the fatty diet and she found out that the pt had tricuspid insufficieny affecting liver function and causing circulatory collapse in her legs.  The pt was refused oxygen when gasping for breath and there is much more.  \n\nThe daughter contacted the coroner a few weeks later after reading the notes and gradually piecing together all the events surrounding the death of the patient.  The daughter had contacted everyone she could think of including PALS while the pt was in hospital, and to this day does not know how pts can be rescued from such circumstances and guaranteed help to die without pain and indignity.", "We thank you for taking the time to provide us with your feedback.

I was very ill with ulcerative colitis at the time and severely anaemic. My tooth started hurting when eating and for  a while after eating before Christmas that year and despite being very ill I struggled in to get something done. He looked at it and said it looked fine but he could put a gold crown on because I was sick I didn't have amalgam. I asked if he could do a white filling or a temporary filling because there was too much tooth left to put a crown on and I couldn't stay long due to my health. He refused both and I just asked him if it was safe to leave it not knowing what else to do. He said it would be ok. I went home and it started hurting severely during the Christmas holidays for several days I was in pain.. There were no emergency dentists for the whole time   until it stopped hurting and even then when the nerve was obviously dead I couldn't have got to the nearest one and queued for treatment which was already to late.\nThat's only the start of the story. The tooth hurt on biting for a while and I went to the dentist again when the filling finally fell out because it was loose. Then a temporary filling was put in. Eventually later that year a partial gold crown was put on even though I told the dentist the tooth was dead. He just looked at the Xrays and did nothing else to determine if it was dead. He said they were inconclusive.\nAfter the crown was on the remainder of the tooth soon broke off and I had to go back again. He then repaired the broken part with composite stuck onto the gold.\nI asked if would stick and he didn't seem too sure. Not long after the repair broke off taking more of the tooth with it. When I went back again he admitted he had been unprofessional repairing it that way and said it was a disaster but he decided to level the tooth to teh gum and put a complete crown on. This seemed to work but the tooth was still dead with no root canal and hurt on biting sometimes. He did the crown with no anaesthetic and there was no pain. Nevertheless he still refused to accept the nerve was dead.  I entirely lost confidence in this dentist. He has been rude to me and threatened to take teeth out when I complained of pain. The same thing happened with a lower molar before this and eventually he had to admit it was dead when pus came through the gum. He may have been able to save that one too if he had replaced the filling in time. He prevents me seeing the other dentist in his practice.  When the tooth started giving me a lot more pain this year I finally had to go a private dentist and she found pus coming from around the tooth and determined it was infected. and would need a root canal. I have decided to get this done at the cost of \u00a3300 to \u00a3450 because I no longer trust the NHS dentist and I believe he caused me to need this root canal.  \nI may now need to also pay for another crown which will cost another 400 to 500 and I normally get free treatment. There are no other NHS dentists in my area either. He also made no allowance for my state of health and I felt he treated me disrespectfully. \nRecently he also left a temporary filling in a back tooth for two and a half years, which was quite deep. There was little left and the dentine was exposed close to the  pulp. The private dentist said this was unacceptable and filled it. He was eventually going to put a gold crown on which the private dentist also said was unnecessary. He also has left a wisdom tooth with a hole in it for the several years where a filling fell out\n\n Sorry about the long story.\n", "My grandfather was admitted to urology for re-catherization and ended up being in there for 6 weeks. Doctors had told us he would be back at home making boxes for the garden which he was doing a couple of weeks before admission. \n\nPrior to admission my grandfather was mobilizing himself. He would walk to the garden, round the block, even to the toilet but would need assistance of carers for other things only 2 days this was implemented before. Before admission my grandfather had no pressure sores, clean teeth, shaven, immaculately clean and tidy, could feed himself and would drink huge amounts of fluids. My grandfather was then moved to another ward where the care he received was even worse - he had bruising which appeared all over his arms and had a couple of skin tears. We had asked but not been given cot bumpers to protect him whilst in bed as he would always lean to one side due to his tumour.\n\nNurses had told me on more occasions than I can remember that they were turning my grandfather for pressure relief but every time I had visited and that was very often he was always on his back his dressing had been left on that long they were all weepy. I asked whilst in there to change his dressing I even offered myself to change it but I was never allowed to. \n\nThey had left meals for him to eat which half of the time he had spilt. Medication more often than not was left on a pot on the table in his bed or on the floor which he could not put the tablets in his mouth or lift a cup. When I left I'd always give him the call bell every time I went in he'd never have it. One time it was left at the top of his pillow tucked in. How was he going to reach it? My grandfather said to me once if only I could tell you. \n\nIt seemed to me that he was not being given fluids, they said he was refusing it. Every time family would go in he would drink like a fish so then would go on a drip for re-hydration. He also contracted c difficile and mrsa whilst in there care which the test I had requested myself. \n\nBy the end of his stay my grandfather was incontinent. On discharge from hospital my family were told that he was clear from infection meaning no more cdifficile when 2 days after being home we requested his own gp do a stool sample. \n\nAfter my grandfather's death, we received the test results in which he tested positive for cdifficile. My grandfather was a terminal cancer patient with no pain management he was given paracetamol for god sake. 4 days after discharge my grandfather lost his life. I think this is down to the impact of treatment he received in this hospital's care. I sincerely hope this never happens to anyone else.\n", "I was under this hospital from early 2003 for water infections and blood in my water which I was in pain for, I had several tests done but the symptons continued over a 5 year period and all I was put on was antibiotics which doesn't help.\nOver this time up to 2008 I had made several attempts to get my problem sorted through appointments with urology department - even made a few attempts through a&e but told by triage that I only had stomach ache and to go home and take paracetomal. This was all the care I received until june 2008 when my husband who is a disabled person called an ambulance. When they turned up I had the same treatment as before, that he should have called for a doctor as I only had a stomach ache which wasn't bad enough for an ambulance. my husband was very upset and told them that they either take me in to hospital or he would take me in himself as I was in so much pain that I couldn't walk properly. They did then take me but they made me walk in acute pain bent over to the ambulance which was over 200 yards away from my home. \n\nWhen I finally got to Frimley Park Hospital the doctor that saw me told my husband and I that I was suffering from acute kidney failure and if left a few more days I would not be here talking to you, i would have been dead.\n\nI was in hospital for over 5 days in this time I only saw a doctor a couple of times and in this time was told that they had put a stent in to my kidney so that it could work the best way it could as I was only born with 1 kidney and this is the reason for all my water infections. Apparently my kidney wasn't working to its fullest.\n\nSo why did this hospital leave me for 5 years in pain from water infections and blood in my water?\n\nReleased from hospital in June 2008, told everything was fine but I had to go back after a few weeks for a check up and results on outstanding scans.\n\nMy husband and I went back sat in and sat in out patient department for over a hour and half over my appointment time. I listened to another person complaining that they were going to be late for further appointments so the staff decided to put this person in before me to keep him quiet, not bad considering I was already one and half hours over my appointment.\n\nWhen it finally came to my appointment a man came out and called my name and I asked my husband who he was because I had never met him before and my husband said he had never seen him before either. I walked in through the door and before I had a chance to sit down he said he was sorry to hear that I had Bladder Cancer, which you could imagine took me by complete shock as no one had mentioned that I had suspected cancer when I was in hospital a few weeks before. I remember sitting down and listening to this urology surgeon talking to me but don't remember everything that was told to me other than they were releasing me from the Hospital as they were sending me to St Peter's Hospital in Chertsey for them to sort my Bladder Cancer out.\n\nAt no point did I have my husband with me when they broke the news I had cancer - there wasn't even a nurse in the room with him either. I left the room in a daze and in shock I walked past my husband and when I got out of the front entrance of the hospital broke down in tear. I told him what I had been told and he was at that point very angry because no one at any point had told him that I had cancer. He wanted to go back and find out what their game was and wanted to know how the hell I got Bladder Cancer after being under Frimley Park Hospital for over 5 years for treatment of water infections and blood in water and nothing sorted until I was rushed into hospital with acute kidney failure. Since having bladder cancer I have found out from cancer research that continuous water infections and blood in water is a symptom of Bladder Cancer so I am disgusted with Frimley Park Hospital as I was seeking help from this hospital for this condition with out any help. \n\nSince I found out I had Bladder Cancer I have had my bladder removed straight away because the cancer was so far advanced the other hospital could not save my bladder. I have had to live with incontinance problems since and had to live with a stoma and a disposable bag which has to be changed every time I go to the toilet. I feel this is all because Frimley Park Urology department couldn't work out why I was having continous water infections over a 5 year term.\n\nI did make a complaint to this hospital but this hospital didn't take any blame in me getting bladder cancer. Apparently a letter from a senior manager at the trust which stated that I should have known I had cancer and that it was my doctors responsibility also - but I feel that it isn't mine or my doctors fault that this was not diagnosed because my doctor did everyting thing they should have, and I continually sought help. The hospital advised them to do because after all I was under Frimley Park Hospital for treatment which I certain did not get and still don't.\n\nThis hospital seems to have a very good reputation with the public but in my case, the hospital failed to diagnose me with a very serious illness and I have not received an apology. \n\nI am still under St Peters Hospital Chertsey and this hospital seems to often get the rough end of the stick with the press but in my opinion it is a great hospital and in my experience, there is always some one there that will talk to my about any worries - something I've not experienced at Frimley Park Hospital.\n\nI do give any one a bit of information though and that is if you have any of the early symptoms that I had, which ever hospital you are under, push hard to get answers but if you are not happy with what a hospital is saying I would say get a second opinion because I wish I had - I might have been saved all this in the first place.\n\n ", "I have just returned home from collecting my fiance from the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales.\n\nShe suffers from Bi-Polar, for those who dont know, this is a serious mental illness, that can bring on extremley serious bouts of depression, which can often lead to suicidal tendancies. She has been on various anti depressants to control the illness, and has been waiting to see a Pyschiatrist since last November.\n\nLast night she made an attempt on her life, by overdosing on a cocktail of anti depressants, pain killers and whisky. After phoning 999 and giving them the drugs names and approximate quantities, the ambulance finaly arrived nearly 40 minutes later! I should point out, we live a mere 10 minutes from the Royal Gwent, however I was expecting the ambulance to arrive in less time than that, and was under the impression that she would be in medical hands sooner by using the 999 service. \n\nApproximatley an hour after the 999 call was placed, the ambulance arrived at The Royal Gwent. I drove myself in the car, and arrived 10 minutes BEFORE the ambulance. By now it was midnight. The paramedic crew then led us into the A&E waiting corridor, where we joing a queue of numerous beds, trolleys and wheelchairs. Having never been to hospital in an ambulance, or accompanied anyone in an ambulance, I had been under the impression that ambulance arrivals always saw the Triage nurse immediatley upon arrival. Obviously not, or atleast in the case of The Royal Gwent, weather this is the same with all hospital's I have no idea. Upon speaking to my partner it became evident that no medical care had been administered in the ambulance. At the time, I took this as a good sign, as they must of been under the impression that she had not taken enough medicine to do serious damage.\n\nAfter waiting in the corridor for about 30 minutes, we were seen. Temperature, and pulse rate was taken, as was an ECG. At this point I was asked to wait in the waiting area and was told my fiance would be shown where I was after the ECG. So an hour and a half after a 999 call was placed for an overdose, the overdoseee was having there pulse taken. And nothing else! \n\nAround 10 minutes later my fiance joined me in the waiting area. I asked her what they had done, and was told about the ECG, and that she didnt know what was happen, as she had just been told to wait. So we waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. It became evident that my belief that she had not consumed enough to any serious physical damage was correct, as no treatment had been given, so we started to believe that we would be sent home soon.\n\nAt 02:30, after being left in the waiting area for nealy 1 3/4 hours with no communication and no idea what was going on, we decided to go and find a nurse to find out what was happening. At this point they decided to take her blood, and I was asked to go wait in the waiting area again. Weather or not they were about to call her, or weather they only took her blood then because we had gone to find them is unclear, however I am inclined to believe the latter. When she returned, my partner told me that they had taken blood, and she waiting to see the doctor, and there was one person ahead of her in the list. By the time the doctor called her it was around 3am. It had taken FOUR HOURS from the initial 999 call to be seen by a doctor and recieve anything resembling medical treatment, other than tests a GP can perform, or even a semi competant person could perform at home with the right equipment, which is readily available to buy.\n\nThe doctor however did not provide any treatment. I should point out that my partner had taken an overdose a few years previously, and NONE of the things that were done to her on the first occasion, were done last night. This of course cemented our belief that the quantites taken were not life threatening, and we would be sent home at some point. After seeing the doctor, who gave no treatment, but merley spoke to her, my partner informed me that he was going to speak to the Pyschiatrist, and then wait for the blood test results before taking any further action, and we were to wait in the waiting area, again. By 3:30 in the morning, after sitting round in the hospital doing nothing, and having very little done my fiance was beginning to get fed up and bored and wanting to go home. After another 15 minutes of waiting, and 45 minutes after last seeing the doctor and an hour and a quater after her blood tests, again we went looking for the nurses for some information as to what was happening, and we were told to return to the waiting area to wait. At this point my fiance decided that all she wanted to do was go home to bed. I was reluctant to agree and suggested she would be better waiting in hospital until she was given the all clear, but after assureing me she felt ok and promising to phone the doctor to make an appointment first thing in the morning I agreed, so off we went to find someone to tell them we were off home. It was at this point we were told she could not self discharge. Although they were powerless to physicaly stop us leaving, should we do so, they were legally obligied to phone the police, who would then come to our home and arrest her under the mental health act. Naturaly we sat back down. A short while later, merely 5 minutes, my fiance was called. She was told that she was being kept in and they were finding a bed for her. It had taken them nearly four hours to decide to keep her in, so the Pyschiatrist could speak to her in the morning. I told her I would wait until they found her a bed before going home. She told me that they couldnt find me a bed so they were going to give her one in A&E. As I could see atleast 2 empty beds from where we were sitting I thought this was immeninant so left her and went home to bed, as I had an interview at 10am the following day, less than 6 hours time. My girlfriend assured me she would phone me as soon as she had any news in the morning.\n\nAfter my interview I phoned the hospital for news as to what was happening. After speaking to 2 different departments who both told me at first that she was no longer with them, and then she had never been with them, I was put through to A&E. They informed me that she had gone home at 9:45. I told them we lived together, and she wasnt home and I was due to pick her up myself. We had forgotten to pick up her mobile when she went in the ambulance, and as such I couldnt phone her directly. I was told by the person on the other end of the line that she would find out and put me on hold. After being on hold for 20 minutes I logged on to Facebook and recieved a message from my fiances brother, telling me she needed picking up from the hospital. This had been sent at 11am, 1 1/4 hours after the she had apparently gone home. I hung up the phone and drove to the hospital, planning to go to reception to being the hunt, as I had no idea where in the hospital she required picking up from. \n\nMy fiance was waiting for me by the gate, where she had been since 9:30am. Some two hours. I asked what had happened and what had been said. She told me she wasnt given a bed, and had to wait in the waiting area, on hard plastic seats. Yet again, she had gone to find the nurses to get something done. I had left her at 4am, and at 8am after a mere half hour sleep, no-one had spoken to her or informed her what was happening. At 8am she was told she would get breakfast soon and then the Pyschiatrist would see her. She got no breakfast, but she was seen by the Pyschiatrist at around 9am.\n\nHaving been kept in hospital against her will overnight I would of expected a full 20-30 minute consultation, possibly a prescription and an appointment for a follow interview. What actualy happened was very little. The conversation was around 15 minutes, and the result was my fiance being given the phone number for \"Mind\" the mental health charity, and told to phone them, see if she can get any help from them, and that her GP would be informed. With that she was told she could go home. Only she couldnt get home. After being told she couldnt get hospital transport home and would have to find her own way home she tried phoning me, but couldnt remember my number. She then phoned her dad, who lives in Taunton, and asked him to phone me, but he dosent have my number. She was left potentialy stranded. The only good thing The Royal Gwent did all night was to allow her to use there phone to try and get a lift home. After this they allowed her to go outside on her own with out any knowledge of how she was getting home.\n\nThis in itself I find wholley irresponsible. We have a person with history of mental illness, on a waiting list to see a Pyschiatrist being allowed to wander off on her own less than 12 hours after a 2nd suicide attempt in 4 years after recieving little to no treatment.\n\nIn my view the way my fiance was uncared for and unlooked after and untreated is disgusting. There was no information passed along to us, and the only time she was seen in any way was when we went looking and pestered ourselves. Basicaly they didnt seem to care one jot, and rather than viewing my partner as someone who needed help, if not medical than mental, I feel that she was treated as an insignificance.  No respect. No Information. No Care.\n\nIf my partner ever needs any kind of medical treatment again, I wont be bothering with 999 and risk being taken to the Royal Gwent again, I'll take my chances and drive her to The University of Wales Hospital Heath in cardiff myself. \n\nWords can not fully truly or accuratley describe my disgust with the Royal Gwent Hospital. I feel that calling it a Hospital in the first place is laughable enough.  \n\nDisgusted, absolutely disgusted!", "Just quickly don't expect much from my spelling or grammar, its late and I just want to get my message across about how I feel The Cherrywood Clinic and the unseen doctor with their team of professionals have, in my opinion, failed me and my depression. \n\nI think I was 17 when I was first sent to his place. I suffer from depression and have on many occasions been through panic attacks, break downs and considered suicide. I haven't had an appointment since last September, they have sent me regular apologies of how my latest appointment has been cancelled and have moved me to a more suited time slot for the next month, so its been 10 months altogether since they last saw me. Obviously the doctor (whoever they are, they've never talked to me personally, as far as I'm aware they just sign documents which I feel is in attempt to make it look like they're doing something) has got more urgent cases than someone who is right now considering killing himself.\n\nWhen they did see me (some time last year) I would wait in the 1970's waiting area alone until called to see the doctor, who could be anyone - during every visit a new nameless face would take me to an empty room and ask me who I was. I would be asked how I was and as far as I can tell it didn't really matter if I said \u201cI'm ok\u201d or \u201cI want to kill myself\u201d I would be given a cold smile and questioned slightly about why I felt that way then told to either carry on taking the tablets (which are fantastic they just knock me out and make me stop caring about everything, I turn into a zombie, everyone seems happy) or to higher my amount taken. That's it, that's all I'm told before being asked to leave and come back in a month. I have asked if I can leave as they have never helped me in any way but I just get told to come back. I wanted to get off the tablets but they're addictive and apparently I would need some kind of rehab type help from the doctor and his colleagues (sadly they have never helped me so I managed to do it myself and that was hard). \n\nThere's lots of things I could say about this service and how I hate them for leaving me without help when I was promised it but I haven't really got time. Since going to see the Cherrywood people I have been diagnosed with several different mental health problems which feels very random, the best one being asperger's syndrome. My mum used the word asperger's once when she came and next month my newest doctor opened up a file and casually mention that I had be diagnosed with asperger's syndrome - news to me! But when the unseen doctor sent my university evidence and some special needs asperger's syndrome was on there, I've stopped caring.\n\nI'm not going to write or phone the doctor as it gets me angry and I\u2018ll either break down or swear too much, I'm getting worked up now. I'm dealing with my depression alone and its hard without the pills, it's a horrible world but I have to deal with that. The NHS has made me feel lonelier, not better. Who can you go to when the doctor doesn't seem to care?\n\nI'd like to end with saying that I'm not mad or insane but they have made me feel that, I now giggle watching one flew over the cuckoo's nest because I feel Jack Nicolson got lucky, atleast Nurse Ratched talked to him. \n\nVery few people know how depressed I am right now if anyone at all. People wont talk about suicide, it scares them and they assume you just want attention, so right now all I have is me and that scares me.\n", "I have been in severe distress with growing suicide ideation.  I spoke to the local out of hours Crisis Team (the person I spoke to was brilliant).  This person suggested that I book an appointment with my ex consultant (no longer under his care) as I needed help.  \n\nNotes on the local computer system said that my ex consultant had welcomed me making an appointment if ever I needed to see him so I was not imagining this part.  I tried to do this only to find that he had had a complete turn around and would only see my if the CPN thought it necessary.  \n\nI do not have an appointment with this CPN for another 2 weeks so by then the \"crisis\" will either be over or I might take a more successful overdose this time (my husband caught me attemtping suicide).  In the end it was suggested that I visit our local Adult MH Services duty desk which I have done.  The person I saw was lovely, kind and listened.

Everything was fine for 2.5 years until I contacted a severe infection as follows:\nAdmitted to Wythenshawe hospital in June 2009, with severe pain in hip.   Put on intravenous antibiotics and bed rest.  Various tests. Near the end of 4th week, hip was aspirated but because of intravenous antibiotics the infection had been masked and it was unclear what the infection was.  At my request I was discharged to Wrightington Hospital on in mid July and put on intravenous vancomycin.  I had a reaction to vancomycin, having a red rash over my body, my legs swelled and I had to wear surgical stockings.\nI was discharged t the start of August 2009 from Wrightington with 4 weeks supply of antibiotics, Linzolid and Rifampacin, and had to have weekly blood tests at my GPs surgery.\nA week after finishing the above antibiotics I was again in severe pain and had to take painkillers again.  \n\nAttended an outpatient appointment at Wrightington Hospital at the start of September 2009, had a blood test and given another appointment for late October 2009. At this appointment couldn't bear my hip to be touched. \n\nTold to return the next day for an aspiration on my hip.  Prescribed Linzolid again for 2 weeks.  Pain returned within a week after I had finished the antibiotics.\n\nAt the beginning December attended Wrightington Hospital and was prescribed erythromycin for 4 weeks.   \nAttended Wrightington hospital outpatients at the very end of  December because I was still taking antibiotics, was asked to return on the towards the end of January.\nFinished erythromycin on Friday 1 January 2010, pain returned and I rang my GP to request painkillers a week later.\n\nI had an Outpatient appointment in January 2010, it was decided that I needed to have my hip re-done.\n\nAt the beginning of February, visited my GP, was prescribed erythromycin for 4 weeks.\nFinished 4 week course of erythromycin on at the beginning of March. After two days  pain returned much more severe.  I could hardly walk.\n\nI started a 4 week course of antibiotics, still in severe pain, taking paracetamol as well as the antibiotics until the antibiotics work.\n\nI went to Wrightington Hospital on Friday 19th April for pre-op tests.\nStill on antibiotics. I then received letter from Wrightington informing me my blood was abnormal and I was being taken off the waiting list.\nMy doctor put me on Iron tablets then told me to stop taking them.\n\nHad a blood test on in early May and saw the doctor a few days later.  My iron levels normal, blood count abnormal.  \n\nWent to Wrightington Hospital for another pre-op test.\nOn Erythromycin 250mg caps x 4 per day (been on erythromycin for nearly 6 months and antibiotics altogether for 11 months)\nThyroxine 100mcg   1 per day\nHad my hip removed on June 2010, was told new hip would be put in within 6 to 12 weeks.\nAfter3 out patient appointment I spoke to the Doctor, who said they would send me a letter to confirm date of having my hip put back in.\n\nAt the beginning of October, phoned Wrightington Hosp re operation, going to send me letter to have pre-op tests.\n12 days later I received letter re pre-op appt for early November. Between attending this appointment and the end of the I rang on 3 separate occasions to see if I had a date for the operations. I was told someone would call me back and they never did\n\nEarly January 2011 I received letter from Wrightington with date for 2nd pre-operation tests book for later that month.\n\nA couple of days after receiving this letter I also received a letter with date for having my hip put back in. This was scheduled for the very end of January.\n\n10 days before my scheduled operation the surgeon phoned to tell me that I was not having my hip put back in as there was still some infected bone cement to remove and that he and and another surgeon would be operating to remove this.  Was also told that my hip would be replaced in a matter of weeks not months.  \n\nI was discharged from hospital at the beginning of February.  Everything was ok, but only problem I had was that after the district nurse took the stitches out one of the stitch wounds took a little longer to heal.\n\nA month after the operation I returned to outpatients to see the doctor who took a swab and arranged for the district nurse to come back until the stitch area had healed.  The Doctor's secretary rang to say there was a slight infection and to continue with antibiotics and the district nurses visits.  I was discharged by the district nurses the following month.\n.\nAt the end of March I returned to Wrightington Outpatient and told to come back in two months.\nI returned to Wrightington and told to come back again in 8 weeks.  We were very upset at this as we had thought we would be told a date for the hip to be put back in.  \n\nMid May we phoned the doctor's secretary as we were very upset that we had made 90 mile round trip just to be told to come back in 8 weeks.\nIn July we returned to Outpatients, and we were told the hip would be put back in within 4-6 weeks.  The surgeon told us that he thought it would be done sooner.\nAfter waiting for the post with an appointment we phoned admissions and was told that I everything was booked up until the middle of September and I was not even on the list.  We then phoned the doctor's secretary who told us she would look into and phone us back.  She phoned us back two days later and told us the date of the pre-op and the date of the operation \u2013 both mid August, and a letter was in the post to confirm this.\nI went for my pre-op and was told to ring the ward on 3 days before the operation to check that everything was ok for admission. At 5pm on this day we received a call to tell us that due to a family bereavement the operation had been cancelled.  Although disappointed we could understand why it was cancelled.  We were told there was to be a meeting and we would be contacted.  We waited the afternoon after the planned meeting and then phoned admissions and were told again everything was booked up until the middle of September.  We phoned the doctor's secretary and she told us that it was being dealt with by the management and someone would get back to us with another date.\n\nWe had a call from the Admissions Manager a few days later. to tell us the new date was at the End of September.\n\n\nI am sending this on behalf of my husband who does not want to complain but I would like to ask:\n\nWhy my husband was on antibiotics for 12 months?\n\n While I can understand why the operation was cancelled, why has he got to wait another 4 weeks to have his hip put back in again?\n\n He has been on crutches now for 14 months and no one sees the struggles he has to get about on these.  He has calluses on his hands and bruises on his arms from the crutches and struggles to get up the stairs to the bedroom.  He can't get in the shower because it is over the bath.  He never complains but I know how much he has gone through in the last 2 years.  I am sorry that this story is so long but I did not want to go through the complaints procedure as we have always been very happy with the doctors and nurses and realise how much they do.  \n", "We are very sorry, and disappointed, to hear that your experience at Wrightington Hospital has fallen short of what we would wish for our patients.\r\n\r\nIf you and your husband would like to contact the Patient Relations Department on 01942 822376 and we will be able to look at how we can resolve these issues for you both", "In January, 2009, I joined the ranks of those men who will die in the near future, in my view, needlessly from cancer that emanated from the Prostate gland. \n\nMy initial complaint to the Health centre involved was met with: 'Sorry about that, hope everything works out and that you receive the appropriate treatment.'   I had written a letter of complaint to my surgery in  Plymouth, because over the proceeding ten months I had seen four different doctors there; through 2008, with ever increasing pain in the the lower body and legs. It took a fifth doctor, at the same surgery, to examine me in January, 2009, for a possible Prostate problem which was confirmed four days later - too late as cancer had spread into the local skeleton and lower spine. My nerves leading to and in my feet were irrepairable damaged through 2008.  (PSA 975, Gleeson 4+4). \n\nIn 2002, I believe that every GP was sent a Prostate Risk Management Pack.  Six years on, when I needed the contents of that Pack, through 2008, it was not applied. The above story is by no means unique in playing a part in the avoidable 10,000 deaths (as outlined by the 10000 men charity) that were misdiagnosed over a similiar period of time at various surgeries in various Foundation Trusts around the UK.   See www.10000men.org \n\nMy complaints to the British Medical Council and the Plymouth Health Trust met with the same tactic: 'Sorry to hear about your problems hope that you receive the appropriate treatment', and nothing more. Just what is the 'appropriate treatment' supposed to be when due to the fatal time lapse between bringing a medical problem to your local medical expert's attention and in my view their ineptitude in not responding quickly.  \n\nJust what kind of treatment is left? For myself and the other 9,999 men in my batch getting ready for departure, there was nothing left of a life-saving nature. We have had to endure female hormone treatment, radiotherapy and chemotherapy all of which, have in my experience caused horrendous side-effects, and lead to financial ruin and a slow death.\n ", "The Divisional Director for Adult Mental Health has now provided the following response:\r\n'Thank you for your feedback and I am sorry to hear about your situation.

I did not contact the hospital as I knew the contractions needed to be 3-5 minutes apart and I needed to be at least 4cm dilated or I would be sent home again.\nThey settled down until the next evening and by the early hours of the day after they were 3 minutes apart so I rang the Triage Ward at Queens Hospital.\nI was asked where the pain was and I said 'down low, very painful and the pains were 3 minutes apart' as I'd been sat in my kitchen timing them!\nThe Triage Nurse replied that that's just normal pregnancy cramps and to call back when the real pains started up high.\u00a0I told her that they had started up high the day before and I knew the labour had started properly but she insisted that I stay at home and wait for it to start properly. My sister and I decided against that advice and made our way to Queens Hospital.\nI arrived there at 2:30am and after being examined I was 4cm dilated and the labour had started. I had quite a sick labour and was on Gas & Air to begin with, but had stated in my birth plan that if I wasn't coping with the Gas & Air alone I would like an epidural.\nI was waiting in the triage ward for 2-3 hours for a bed on the labour ward to become available, when I did eventually get a bed I was made to get up and walk to the room where I was to give birth \u2013 whilst vomiting.\nI was then greeted by the midwife who would be delivering me. Her attitude right from the beginning was utterly appalling. She did not speak to me at all for the first 20 minutes or so, just groaned when I was asking her questions. \nMy sister who was my birthing partner asked if my robe could be changed as I had been very sick on it and it smelt disgusting \u2013 the midwife refused and told her to leave it.\nOnce the labour was in full swing I was in pain and still using the Gas and Air. The Midwife told me not to use the Gas & Air when I wasn't in pain as it was a waste. I started to feel that I wanted to push but she kept telling me I wasn't ready. I asked her to examine me and see how dilated I was - she refused as due to Health and Safety, and said I could only be examined every 4 hours.\nI was starting to lose my temper and said I couldn't resist the urge to push and please, please could she examine me, so she did and said I was 10cm dilated and so ready to start pushing at which point she took the Gas & Air off me and I now had no pain relief. I was trying to keep hold of the gas & air and she physically ripped it from my hand and said No.\nWithin half an hour of no pain relief I was really struggling and asked for the epidural. I was refused this as there may not be enough time and the anaesthetist would be at least half an hour as he was too busy. I had a drip put in my hand should the anaesthetist become available. This was not kept an eye on and during the birth was twisted round in my wrist and made my wrist balloon and eventually go black.\nWhilst pushing and trying to give birth, the midwife stood leaning against the wall about a foot away from me with her arms crossed telling me to \u201cclose your mouth, I don't want to hear that noise\u201d and \u201churry up, my shift is finished in 45 minutes and I'm tired and want to go home\u201d.\nShe was not in the slightest bit encouraging and told me to just push like I was going to the toilet and just kept repeating the word \u201ctoilet\u201d.\nMy waters were not breaking so I had to ask her over and over again to break them for me. When she did the waters were a very green colour \u2013 my baby had done a poo in my waters as he was distressed and decided she was going to perform an episiotomy as the baby kept slipping back up. My sister was at the end of my bed at this point and asked the midwife why she was struggling when making the incision. The Midwife replied saying \u201cJesus Christ, these scissors are blunt\u201d from what I can gather she should have gone and got a completely new surgical pack but instead she continued hacking away and 30 mins later my son was born.\nThe paediatrician came in and said he was 'grunting' as he was slightly distressed and needed to be brought up to the correct temperature so was put under the heater.\nThe midwife had already left her shift and gone home, leaving my cut open and bleeding heavily. My partner at this point went to find someone to come and stitch up the incision and demanded to know why she had made such a mess of it. Eventually someone came in to do the stitches and explained to us that the midwife had used blunt scissors and she would now have to stitch up the incision but also do some cosmetic stitching as she had torn me in 5 places. Whilst trying to stitch me up it ripped open again as it couldn't hold so some of it had to be left in the hope it would heal on its own.\nAfter giving birth I had to wait nearly all day for a bed on the Post-Natal ward. I was then kept in for 3 days completely unnecessarily. I began to feel very stressed, I found the attitudes of some of the midwives on the post-natal ward absolutely disgusting. Some of them didn't even speak when coming in your room, or just grunted at you when you spoke to them.\nMy episiotomy was quite sore by the 2nd day and I was taking the 2 paracetamol when they were brought round and offered but by the evening of the 2nd day there, I was refused them when they were brought round as I should be careful how many I take. I hadn't even had the six in 24 hours and was in pain.\nBy the 3rd day I was in tears. Someone came round to check my pulse and blood pressure \u2013 my pulse was very high, no-one would let me go home or even come and explain anything to me. The last day I was there I had no breakfast offered, had to go and find something to eat.\nThe midwife that discharged me was so rude to me, I think I can honestly say I have never been spoken to in such a rude manner as I was that day, made even worse still by the fact that I was feeling so vulnerable and needed reassurance. My partner was finally allowed to come and pick me up that evening.\nMy partner can verify, I broke down in tears when I got home. In the following fortnight I had to have two courses of antibiotics as I had an infection in the incision and could not sit down properly for 2 weeks nor bend over or bath properly, going to the toilet was like urinating on an open wound which was so painful.\nSome of the outside skin that had to be left un-stitched has now healed over the stitches (that I was told would dissolve but they haven't) and I am still having pains and twinges when I am sitting down for too long or walking long distances.\nFrom a personal point of view I can only describe the feelings over those 3 days as like being on trial and locked up in the meantime. I should have been able to enjoy my baby but I felt I was being scrutinised the whole time. I do feel emotionally scarred by the whole experience. Giving birth is a very daunting experience at the best of times, especially being my first baby, I pushed so hard to sort out housing because I wanted the best for my baby and I knew I needed to be organised for when he arrived and did not want to even temporarily be in a hostel.\nNone of this was helped by the fact I have no mum around to support me at all, and having to deal with it all alone is what I find most difficult. I will also be honest and admit that I am also now almost too scared to seek any help like counselling or speak to any Health Visitors about any problems I may have as I just feel I would almost be being judged and made to feel inadequate as a parent which I know 100% is not the case.\nI am suffering now in silence, cried over the experience a few times and will not feel better about any of it overnight. I would like this looked into, and am planning on aiming for compensation for the way I was treated and how I've been left feeling \u2013 especially now I feel like I'm alone and like I cannot trust healthcare professionals.\nI cannot name any of the midwives, despite ringing and asking for that information I have been refused more than once, and told if I want to see my notes I will be charged. I am certainly not paying for that information.", "My best friend had prostate trouble and was sent by the Homerton to St.Bart's for radio therapy (31 sessions) in October last year. The treatment went fine but about January of this year he began to have very bad pains in his stomach. He returned to the Homerton several times but was told that his PSI was less than 1% and that the pains were part of the healing process.\n\nI brought him to his Consultant and to A&E several times over the next three months and on every occasion was assured that things would settle down. In early May this year things got so bad that we insisted that a doctor come down to A&E and check him. This doctor asked if we knew what the result of the final CAT scan was (there was nothing on file). What CAT scan? They brought him immediately for a scan.\n\nIt turned out that my friend had cancer of the liver, the spleen and the spine that a CAT scan would have picked up if given. He had been dealing with these cancers with only Paracetamol for over three months. He died three days later.\n\nI doubt if a scan would have prolonged his life but at least he could have been treated for the pain. His Executor was not inclined \"to make a fuss\" so the whole sorry affair was ignored. ", "I went into chelsea and westminster hospital at 10 am in the morning with light brown spotting, pain and cramping at 8 weeks pregnant.  I was examined initially by one excellent doctor who was thorough and precise. Unfortunately in my opinion he was the only decent doctor I saw.   I asked for a scan immediately and was informed that only if necessary would I get a scan.  I said I really really wanted to have one.  He understood and told me to trust him and that he would always fight my corner but may not succeed, even with a threatened misscarriage. \n\nIt took two hours after having seen him to get my urine dipped to confirm a urinary tract infection and a threatened miscarriage.  I was however told that my womb was closed at this point.  I then had to wait a further 6 hours to see another doctor who did the exact same examination and wanted to admit me to a ward.  I still at this point was given no medication for my Urinary Tract Infection which I have had confirmed by my private doctor that it can cause miscarriage.  You can also look at any reference material on a UTI and it will state that it can cause miscarriage. All the doctors I saw in that hospital stated that a UTI could not cause miscarriage. \n\nThey wanted to admit me at 8 pm to have a scan in the morning. They could not do a scan that evening.  For some bizarre reason they don't have a 24 hour scanning facility despite the fact that they have a large maternity ward and that ectopic pregnancies can be fatal if not detected.  I wanted to go home.  They persuaded me by saying that even though neither of them thought it was an ectopic pregnancy,  if something happened to me that they would want to examine me and potentially rush me into theatre if i haemmoraged. \n\nI stayed and was put on a ward with four women. Two eighty year old women who I believe were dying, and two others who must have had some form of gynacological problems.  All of them snored, the nurses were loud and cackling telling jokes all night.  I couldn't sleep was a nervous wreck and exhausted.  Exactly the reason I wanted to stay at home... to sleep.\n\nI miscarried at 5:30 that morning.  I requested to see the doctor and informed the ward nurses that i believed i had miscarried.  I was bleeding and in pain.  I called for the doctor.  The doctor refused to examine me and said I should just wait until 11 am in the morning when my scan was scheduled.  I asked the doctor why on earth I had to stay on the ward, if they wouldn't even examine me to confirm that i was indeed miscarrying and if my womb had opened or if it was closed.  The doctor seemed to have no interest.  I was exasperated. I went down to A and E to see if I could find another doctor to examine me, but because I had already been admitted, i was refused.\n\nAt around 8 am a team of doctors arrived, one older with four doctors who were so young I thought they were students coming around to my bed and started asking questions.  I told the senior doctor that I didn't want a bunch of students standing around my bed. (they all looked about 12 years old)  He ignored the sensitivity of the situation which I found to be quite traumatic having just miscarried and not really wanting an entourage. The senior doctor merely said 'They're doctors, not students\" and proceeded to ask quesstions. I was so upset, traumatised and shocked that I ended up feeling bullied into agreeding to talk to all of these strangers about how I had miscarried. \n\nI then had to wait another 3 hours until the scan.  There was only a sac with no fetal pole or heartbeat. I was told I would naturally miscarry, which i proceeded to do over the next several days. \n\nThey discharged me and forgot to give me my medication.  I called up the hospital and asked for the medication.  They said (this was at around 2 pm I left the hospital before midday) that they had not written up the discharge papers and I would have to wait for the doctor and they would contact me with my prescription. This never happened.\n\nLater that afternoon i was rushed back to the Hospital - this time I choose Kingston not bearing the thought of going back to C + W.  They were surprised by the choice of medicine prescribed because I didn't have a straight forward UTI as I was initially told, I had a kidney infection and was screaming in pain.   I was initially at C+ W put on Cefelexin.  They took me immediately off that and put me on Trimetheprim.  Three days later having had enough of hospital and not getting any better, I called a private doctor.  The doctor said both sets had got it wrong, that Cefelexin wasn't strong enough, and Trimetheprim had formed a well known resistance in the Wandsworth area.  So she prescribed Augmentin.  Less than 10 hours later I felt right as rain and then proceeded to recover. \n\nThe insensitivity, lack of care and what I feel is general ineptitude of the staff I saw in C+W make me never want to go back to a hospital and the entire experience is making me second guess ever wanting to be pregnant again.  I believe 80% of the trauma of the miscarriage was actually caused by the hospital.", "Dear Sir/Madam,\n                         The following incidences occurred during my brothers fatal association with the world of psychiatry. \n\u2022\tDespite the insistence of my brother and family members regarding his emotional well-being.

My experience of the assessment - conducted by a 'psychoanalytical psychotherapist' -  was utterly traumatic and appalling, and continues to disturb me psychologically today.  I felt that the therapist used sinister techniques throughout (so you lied, so you put on an act, . . and continued to use these techniques through the three assessment sessions, despite having herself diagnosed this as being unsettling for me). They showed no sensitivity whatsoever to the fact that I was feeling suicidal - when I revealed some of my plans she replied \"well of course you'd want to make sure they were fail safe if you were intent on [committing suicide]. I felt that they were cavalier beyond words, and placed me under severe psychological duress to comply to thier narratives of my life, rather than my own. \n\nThey categorically refused to give me the CMHT 24-hr Crisis Number, despite having had to admit myself to a Suicide Respite Centre over the late April Bank Holiday weekend (I had to do this because I was not given the crisis number by the CMHT manager, despite having complained to the Local Authority (because calls from CMHT were not returned) that I was feeling suicidal. My complaint is currently being investigated by the Clinical Director, but I wish to bring it to the attention of this site, because  I am concerned that different evidence now seems to be coming to light, after having made the complaint. I now have two very differently worded assessment reports, both bearing the same date - but one claiming to my GP I attended my last assessment session; the other with an added note, admitting that I did not. I request for an explanation for this. I specifically requested Art Therapy treatment, as I know that I do not respond well to one-to-one talking therapy of any kind (Art Therapy was also recommended as suitable for me in writing, by the Suicide Respite Centre), but have yet to be able to access this (we seem to keep going round in circles with referrals here). \n\nMy main point is that psychotherapists are 'self-regulated', and in my view operate by acquiring psychological power and control over their patients, and using sinister techniques to get them to comply to their narratives, with no care for the consequences, whereas art therapists are state-regulated healthcare professionals. I raised my concerns about this therapist directly after the first session but was placed under pressure to continue seeing them(they still seem to be under the highly deluded impression that I was 'upset' that they cancelled a session; I simply just never wanted to see them again and to be referred to someone more suitable) . Until my referral to the CMH,  I felt I was receiving excellent care from my GP, but this has been a real wake-up call to the appalling treatment anyone with mental health problems may face from a CMHT. I cannot express in words how disgusted I am by the treatment received from this psychotherapist, and the psychological damage I feel it has caused me. I hope this forewarns patients who are referred to this CMHT what they may expect in an assessment, and to help them understand the sinister practices that in my experience were used by psychoanalytical psychotherapists and the CMHT. \n\nI hope to receive some transparent answers and responsible treatment following my formal complaint, but must say, at this stage I have zero faith in this service and its complaints process. I would advise future users of this service to communicate everything in writing and to keep meticulous records of all communication. I also encourage anyone who feel they have been harmed by a psychotherapist to contact the Clinic for Boundary Studies and support their work to make psychotherapists state-regulated (this was due to happen under the old government regime, but not yet under the new coalition).", "I was taken into A & E with concussion.   They were good there but in the ward I thought the attitude was bad.  I needed the toilet, and was told it was in the corridor, I said I could not stand up or even put pressure on my feet, I was told I could.   My alarm was hooked over my trolley table and every time the nurse came to me to do tests she pushed it out of the way, I could not send for help.   There was a dirty glass half full of water on that trolley, it was out of reach.   I was not offered one hot drink or any clean water from ten at night until the day shift came on, they were good, washed me, gave me a hot drink, asked if I wanted breakfast.\n\nI asked for home situation to be taken into account before discharge because my husband has serious mobility problems, and difficulty using his hands.  It felt like nobody took any notice of what I said, I was discharged into the care of a man who was awaiting spinal surgery.\n\nMY GP is a caring and competent doctor, she was shocked I had not had a brain scan, so arranged one, it turned out I had a mini stroke, yet a nurse had told me I could walk, and deal with my own toilet needs. I never saw  the person in charge of the ward. \n\nTo put it bluntly, when I insisted on a commode when I had finished she said \"get back into bed then\"   I could not move myself.  She manhandled me, and I told her my bum should be wiped first.   She gave me two little bits of tissue, I had to do it myself, she did not clean my hands till I told her they were stained with you know what, and could cause hospital infection.\n\nIt was fifteen months before I was well enough to report it, it turns out the time limit to report it locally is twelve months.   I couldn't, I was not well enough.\n\nMy husband has needed occasional hospital care including surgery for over 40 years.  In my opinion some wards are very good, some are a disgrace.\n", "My Mum passed away in Heartlands hospital late last year.\nShe made the decision not to have any more dialysis as it was not helping so we got to spend some quality time before she passed away.\nPrevious to this my Mom kept telling me that she was being abused by three members of staff. I thought she was just confused and i shamefully told her not to be silly.\nIt was only when another patient and her family pulled me to one side and told me that what Mom was saying was true that i took it seriously. I was devastated to think that i ignored my Mom when she needed me most.\nI reported these staff, and to this day i have heard nothing about what has been done to stop these so-called carers from inflicting harm on someone else's loved ones. To be totally honest i have tried to block it out as i get too upset. Selfish I know, but it is too late for my Mom now.\nThe majority of the staff were wonderful, including the haemodialysis department. Some of the lovely staff came to say goodbye to Mom in her last few hours and really did care about her, they are the true angels.\nSadly, another lady lost her Mother too on the same ward the day before mine, and i have since found out that she complained about two of the same staff as well.\nThe only thing that gets me through this is the fact that i believe in Karma and what goes around comes around.", "What was supposed to be a day case procedure has now turned into a 4 week epic. My partner walked into Corbett's to have a caudal epidural- an injection to ease back pain and was told he'd be back at home for his lunch.  He felt the needle go in and was in severe pain. I was phoned to say he had been 'dead-legged' and I shouldn't worry, he'd be back to normal within 24 hrs, but failed to tell me that everyone else had got up and gone home. It took them 5 hours to transfer him to Russell's Hall. He had no feeling in both legs for 3 days, then got movement back in his one leg. He is now reliant on 2 crutches and a wheelchair to get about. \n\nI've had no explanation of what's wrong with him and his expected recovery time. The consultant did speak to him, but my other half was so spaced out on morphine and painkillers, he can't remember what was said to him. I've never even spoken to a consultant/ doctor and I'm down as his next of kin.  He's been rushed back in through a referral from a physio, still no doctor nor consultant. No explanation of whats wrong and if/when he'll recover. We're absolutely furious and anxious as this affects not just the patient but all our family.

I was in there for a month, sectioned for no reason in my opinion, took there by police. \nAnother thing there was nothing I could do about being sectioned apparently according to soliciters. Until I was in hospital I couldn't do anything to get out, my understanding is that that's the law. I think this is ridiculous. \nI got put in seclusion for no reason as far as I could tell, I was forced to take meds or threatened with injection. It felt like nobody explained what was goin on, I was just left in a room for hours locked in without a drink. I got put in there a few times, I don't think know why and left. \nI think the staff didn't like me havin a opinion and when I did I felt they put me through sheer hell for it. \nI feel like I was talked to like rubbish by staff who in my opinion were as strange as some of the patients. The consultant stopped my antipsychotic suddenly without stopping slowly which I think you're meant to do and they are meant to be a professional - i think this is a joke. I had bad withdrawal symptoms.\nI think these places are awful and didn't help me, just traumatized me and made me worse.", "I was assessed by the Streatham CMHT who didn't agree to take me on, I felt they completely ignored that I was suicidal. My GP asked for me to be seen within 3 days \u2013 I waited 2 weeks. I was told I could not be taken on by the CMHT, and felt it was because I was working and well-dressed. What I found worse, was that I had to call them to find this out as I was never told of the outcome of the assessment. \nI tried to tell a team member I was seriously suicidal and at risk of doing something but it is very, very difficult to talk about these things and I was scared of being sectioned. They did not give me the impression of taking the suicidal thoughts and intent seriously but was dismissive and told me that because I had said the thoughts were lessening, I was safe although I clearly said I wasn't. I ended up making 2 attempts within 2 weeks.\n", "After an admission to hospital  the HTT refused to take me on, in what I found to be a very rude manner. I had been placed under their care following an overdose. Less than two weeks later I again attempted suicide. I felt I had made my feelings clear to the HTT and they did not act.\nI found both of the staff that assessed me in hospital both very rude and unhelpful. One asked the other 'what did she do?' to which she replied '*superficially* cut her wtists', emphasis on the superficially. I think it is very rude and demeaning to speak about someone in that way when they were there and also I think they knew what I had done to be admitted and they were just saying my attempt was not serious. \n\nActually I was trying to kill myself and was interrupted by police and paramedics. It is not easy to cut your wrists, I am sorry my attempt was so inept. I have self-harmed since then and that comment and other ones by paramedics and police make me feel like cutting more deeply and that I have never sought medical treatment for fear of a similar nasty, dismissive and uncaring reaction so will be left with scars.\n\nI was told that I had said I found it difficult to deal with having 'so many different people' but I never had. The HTT seem fixated on this and to believe that service users think this without even asking them. They may have said something about their being a lot of different faces to which I might have agreed \u2013 service users, when vulnerable, can agree to almost anything that is said so as not to seem 'difficult' or go along with what they think the professionals think they 'should' think. I certainly never found this a problem and don't care about the number of different people I see, just how well they do their job. On this, I feel there is a lot of variation. In my opinion some staff are good, some are not and seem just to want to see the service user is alive, give medication, and leave.\nI was told that I had not been honest with the HTT which felt like discipline for being a 'bad' service user. Actually I had been.\n\nI don't think the HTT realise how difficult it is to tell people about self-harm or suicidal feelings. I was asked if I would disclose this, and told if I couldn't, they would have to look at hospital which I found very coercive, and only results in the service user not disclosing those thoughts and feelings so is counterproductive. How about instead working with the service user so that they feel they can be honest and that decisions will be made with them about their care? I have had staff disclose  my feeling suicidal to other staff, without asking or even telling me. I was terrified of being sectioned and it was a direct result of this unhelpful comment that I did not seek help. Despite this, I did disclose to the HTT that I had self-harmed and nothing was done about this. I asked for another visit that day as this was the first and was refused this. So I think it was unfair to accuse me of not being honest in the first place.\n\nThese staff members told me that since I had attempted suicide shortly before I would have been discharged by the HTT, this 'must' have been the reason, and therefore they would be doing me a 'dis'service! I find this utterly ignorant. Suicidality is very complex and I wasn't going to attempt just to continue to get the HTT's care to which I was indifferent at best. The reasons are a lot mopre complex than that. Really, I assure you, the HTT is not that amazing in my opinion and service users are not that childish.\nI was told the HTT is a short-term service, I know that, I have mental health problems not learning difficulties. That is all I wanted and needed, to get me through the wobbly period after being discharged from hospital. I tried to explain that I needed someone to talk to and the security of someone being there every day, but was told that the CMHT would be enough care (who did not have an appointment for a week), and that I also had psychotherapy (the waiting list is months and I still have not started). This is utterly not the same thing \u2013 I needed a crisis service.\nFinally, the HTT lost my medication which they had when I was under them and which they should have returned to me. They did not, and the hospital insist they did not receive the medication either. When I asked about this I was made to feel like a timewaster and told to go to my GP, but I needed sleeping tablets that night (sleep being very important for my mental health) and the GP had already closed.\nWhat I found to be incompetent and uncaring treatment made the period after leaving hospital so much more difficult. I think that the HTT badly need some training in human compassion and in working with those with mental health issues.", "My daughter has been sick for years. We originally lived in St Albans, and when she fell pregnant she became very ill and blacked out late into her pregnancy, at which point she was admitted to a Mother and Baby unit. Her husband left her, and once discharged from the unit she came to live with us in London.\nShe fell ill again, and was taken to the Maudsley. The second time, she was admitted voluntarily. During the time she was admitted, there was a serious incident for which we instigated a formal complaint.\nShe was discharged and moved to live close to us \u2013 she seemed ok for a while but then her father died so I retired to look after her. She found herself with a new Doctor, and a Psychiatrist from SLAM who changed her meds to an anti-psychotic. This didn't soothe her. I spoke to the CPN about the medication not working but they said I was just fussing. A couple of days later, my daughter set fire to her own hair. \nI stayed with her for a week but she was very unwell and soon after the Out of Hours Doctor sent her to Ruskin Ward at Guys Hospital. I had an operation myself and was really worried about who would care for my daughter as I recovered. We were promised community care but the day after I was admitted to hospital, her brother went to visit her and found her slumped over the table, she had overdosed. \nShe was rushed to Kings Hospital, who then moved her back to the Maudsley and eventually back to Ruskin Ward. As you can imagine, considering the earlier incident, we didn't feel this was appropriate at all but there seemed no choice. \nShe was discharged home, and her CPN saw her on the Friday but didn't actually do anything as far as I am aware. On the Sunday, they rung me to say she \u2018wasn't well' and I was worried. I went round to see her and called an ambulance. She had set fire to papers in her flat the police had arrived but she wouldn't open the door. She was rushed to Kings and put on oxygen, and then moved back to Guys. The police charged her and made her go to court. \nI don't feel the high response housing team have really done anything to help my daughter or I. They found her a home, but she was so unhappy there. There were two men there and my daughter did not get on with them, it didn't help her. She also only had one meal a day. \nShe was moved to the Ladywell Unit in Lewisham, but she tried to kill herself and no one told me and they moved her back to the Maudsley. I had a meeting with my daughter and her Doctor and I was sent an email suggesting that we rent a house in the area for my daughter to live in.

I was previously known to the services. I was taken in after a serious suicide attempt. During my stay I made further suicide attempts where I needed the staff to use an oxygen lead in the room. After 24 hrs another shift was on and realised the oxygen lead was missing. They calculated I had it on me. The staff nurse took me into a side room and asked for the lead. After I refused to return it, the staff nurse said it was serious for them and if I killed myself they would lose their jobs. I still refused to hand it over. They left me but after I settled for bed the staff woke me and restrained me so they could retrieve the oxygen lead.\n\nFollowing the restraint I needed medication which I had in an injection. I later went to the bathroom where I had been injected and the needle was left in there and had been there several hours with the bathroom accessible to all patients. I later self harmed with the needle. I was discharged on the Monday as I was causing serious difficulties. I was discharged when I was still ill and went straight out and took an overdose. To my knowledge of the situation, the doctor had stated on file that I could not be re-sectioned so the police who wanted to put me on an emergency section were unable as I had been given permission to kill myself. Obiously for me this was a very concerning experience I was placed in hospital for my own safety but evidence shows I was not kept safe. I feel it was lucky I found the needle that had been used on me because it could have put a lot of patients at risk.\n\nRegarding the oxygen lead, in my view staff only cared for their jobs and not to be found out to the point that they restrained me to protect themselves. To be released early not only put me at danger but my partner who also has mental health issues was powerless and he was very concerned. I believe these incidents are very serious and staff should be more alert with serious equipment. If you are place in a place of safety, you expect this sort of thing not to happen.

NHS 24 sent me to hospital three times, where I would get painkillers. The first time I was seen by an incredibly loving doctor who really took care of me and alleviate the pain. The third time I went to hospital after hours in pain and vomiting I was told I might have migraines.\nI went to check this with my GP, who gave me a treatment that worked only for a while. My migraines were being really disruptive and I ended up having a depression. When I went to my GP to check this, he told me to fill out a questionnaire and to come back. He didn't let me speak or explain what I was feeling, he heard \"depression\" and he produced the questionnaire straight away, then he told me he couldn't give any more time to deal with my migraine pain as I didn't have a double appointment and we had already gone through an issue.\nWhen I came back, again, without listening to me, he checked the questionnaire and he said I had a severe depression, and that was the reason for my migraines. I said that I thought it was the other way around. I could easily be in pain 7 days in a row, which made me really sad. I have no family here, NHS was the only thing I could use to feel better. He insisted that my depression was causing the miraines and gave me antidepressants but they didn't work. Then he sent me home with no advice at all about any kind of counselling services or anything.\nAfter another bad experience when dealing with swine flu (I was called liar by another doctor, but that's another story) I decided to change surgery. In the new surgery the doctor gave me a new treatment for the migraines, and I really appreciated that he had time to listen to the symptoms. After a while the treatment stopped working and I was given new pills to try. This new trial and error went on for more than a year, and after so many pills I ended up with a very delicate stomach.\n\nOne day last summer I had to go to the surgery again after a night with severe stomach pain, I thought it was an ulcer. NHS 24 advised me to have some Paracetamol, which didn't work. In the surgery they gave me Omeprazole, but the pain continued. It happened that the next day I went away to my home country, where I decided to see my doctor. She diagnosed a gall bladder full of stones after feeling my tummy, and after an ultrasound she saw that the gallbladder was nearly bursting. I had to have an emergency surgery. Now, I wonder what it would have happened if I had stayed in Edinburgh. I know I sound bitter but being given paracetamol and omeprazole after a night of horrible pain feels a bit like a joke, I felt really left alone by the health system, which was worsened after my first experience at the first surgery.\n\nGoing back to my migraines, after more than two years having them and being really disruptive, I asked to see a neurologist. At this time I was starting to lose my hair and to have memory loss. My doctor said, really lightly, that some tumours manifest that way and he made me touch the tip of my nose tith my index finger and some other exercices, after which he discarded the tumour (is that how a tumour is diagnosed? really?). He changed the medication again and refused for me to see a neurologist. Now, how would anyone feel at this stage? With two misdiagnoses already (the severe depression and the gall bladder) and the suggestion of a tumour, with almost daily pain and a lot of questions about migraines that hadn't improved in two years, what was I supposed to feel?\n\nOne night I had another really sever migraine crisis and I went to hospital again, where the doctor said they couldn't give me anything for the pain as I had reached the maximum amount of opiates I could have. The doctor was really kind but unfortunately she couldn't help me and suggested for me to talk (again) with my gp to change (again) the treatment. I was sent home vomiting and in pain.\n\nWhen I tried to book an appointment with my GP, I was told that he had left the surgery. My new doctor is really caring and she understands how difficult is to deal with the pain almost daily. Her new tratment worked well and it's working so far, I'm really grateful.\n\nWhen I thought my bad luck with NHS had reached an end, I started being bitten by some kind of insect. One of the bites made my left hand really swollen, to the point I couldn't make a fist. \nIn my surgery I can only get appointments if I ask one week in advance, the alternative are emergency appointments. My hand wasn't an emergency so far. \n\nAs NHS Scotland doesn't appear to offer any kind of walk-in centres, I found a walk-in pharmacy service (there is only one in Edinburgh) where I was given antibiotics and I was advised to see my doctor. My hand got better and since by the time I would see my doctor a week would have passed, I thought it would be a waste of time for my surgery.\nI was bitten by an insect again a couple of days ago (on a Friday), this time in my arm. My arm was extremelly swollen and red, and the swelling was extended to my forearm and my elbow. It looked really bad and it was very painful. As I couldn't see my doctor until Monday, NHS 24 sent me to the Royal Infirmary. The doctor there wasn't very reassuring. Her words were \"Oh, that's odd!\" when she saw my arm. Then she asked me for the previous treatment and she resolved to give me more antibiotics. I asked if I could maybe get some strong antihistamins (I was having some that the pharmacy had given me without results) and she said there wasn't anything stronger. She then advised me to see my doctor, as she didn't know what could be happening to me.\n\nI apologize if this looks biaised and emotional, but, really, is \"Oh, that's odd\" reassuring at all when you have a swollen arm and you are in pain? Is it normal that a doctor can't make a diagnosis? Or to be given antidepressants in what I feel is a random way? I used to be healthier than now. My migraines have improved a bit, but my stomach is really sensitive. I think this is due to the large amount of pills taken and I'm resistant to painkillers. Everytime I'm sick I get worried, as I can't see my doctor unless things are really bad, which translates into days of pain and discomfort. In case of an emergency, the hospital can't give me painkillers or a proper diagnosis. I was told lightly that some of my symptoms were caused by a tumour. I don't think this is a humane and caring approach. \nI am realy grateful to my current doctor and to the lovely doctor who saw me when I got first sick, they make me feel that some people really care about patients. I can't say anything positive about anything else, especially regarding my gallbladder. It's really hard to feel helpless when you are sick or in pain, I feel there's nowhere for me to go.", "I am sorry that you appear to have had poor experiences with the NHS.\r\nI can't comment on your specific experiences as I don't know your name.\r\nIf you would like us to look into your experiences and give a full explanation and reply please contact us as below\r\nWrite - NHS Lothian Complaints Team.

Our nightmare started just over a week later. He was in a lot of pain but we had been told to expect this from the hospital, we realised he had lost some weight and when I asked him about it he said he felt sick when he thought of food - this from someone that could have eaten a horse had you put salt and pepper on it.The following day we picked him up from his flat that he shared with his girlfriend, he looked terrible. He sat down and he really was moaning with pain. I told him I was ringing the GP who arrived 20 minutes later. He looked at my son and told me he was sending him to hospital. He gave me a note which stated that my son had a blood clot and he rang the ambulance which arrived about 30 minutes later.It took the paramedics 15 minutes to get him into the ambulance as he was in so much pain, we had gone about 5 min and the paramedic in the back with us told the driver to put the blue lights on. I noticed my son's arm had gone limp and he was being worked on - the driver was told to get us there as quickly as poss and to have the resus team ready. I was in a state of sheer panic by this time. They got my son round and he turned around and said \u2018Mam I thought I had died'. He was crying and so was I. We eventually got to Wansbeck where my son was taken into resus. I was allowed in after 15 minutes. My son still looked ill but the colour had returned to his face. He told me to stop crying. I was told they had given him morphine and had done a couple of tests. About an hour later a Consultant came to seem my son, he told me my son was a fit young lad and he was not worried about him. I replied that I was very worried. I asked what they were going to do, he told me they were going to top my son's pain relief up and send him home in a couple of hours. I was mortified and told him I did not agree with that and that my son had vomited blood and could not eat properly. He relented and they kept him in over night. He was put on a ward and his girlfriend and I went with him. He was really hot and asked his girlfriend to take his jogging pants off but to be careful as his legs were very sore. We mentioned this to a nurse but she just said ok. When we were leaving my son was becoming agitated again and I was worried he may stop breathing like he had in the ambulance. I stood 15 minutes trying to get the attention of the nurses who I overheard discussing their social life. I told them I was worried and they said they would see to him. I wasn't convinced so I rang my son when I got home, he said he was tired because they had given him codeine so I wished him goodnight.The following day I rang my son in the morning. He said he was still tired. I told him I would see him later, and I rung the ward and asked how he had been. They told me he had had a comfortable night. I visited my son in the afternoon, his girlfriend was already there and was told they were discharging him. I wasn't happy about this and expressed my opinion to the Dr who replied by saying that I could probably look after him better at home. I was gobsmacked. Anyway we came home but he vomited nearly all the way home. I said I would take him back in to Wansbeck. He replied by telling me I should stop being obsessive and that they had told him there was nothing wrong with him. He still could not eat properly and remained ill but had picked up slightly. At the beginning of December we had an appt with the doctor who told my son he was not going to examine him because \u2018he didn't look well'. His weight had been taken on the back in November before this appointment and he had been 12 stone 7. On this day, only 2-3 weeks on, he was 10 stone 2. We came out of the hospital and I made an appt at our GPs where he was given antibiotics.The following day my son rang and asked me to make him steak, chips and onions for his dinner. I was over the moon at last he was eating. We went out Christmas shopping and had a lovely day, his girlfriend rang that night to say he had never stopped eating, I was so pleased and went to bed happy for the first time in days.Two days later, my son rang to say he had a sore leg so me and his dad went round. I told him I would ring the Dr but he told me not to, he said he was going to have a bath and see if it helped. As we left the flat he was lying in the bath we were all laughing. He told us he would see us later and that he loved us, we shouted back that we loved him too. It was the last time we saw our beloved son alive, he died just after 3 o'clock. We couldn't believe our normally 6ft 5ins fit and healthy son had gone. A police guard was put on his body in the morgue plus someone from Hexham hospital. No one could go and see him unless they were on a list. All his files were seized from Wansbeck.A post mortem showed that the blood clot had been dated to that first incident where he was taken in by ambulance. No one would sign a death certificate which we assumed was because mistakes had been made. A senior police officer came to see us and said that he normally dealt with murders or manslaughter cases but had been told to do ours. There were two postmortems, both were the same and dated the blood clot at the same date as the first. We had a meeting with the CEO, but all we got out of him was a sorry. An independent investigation was done which highlighted 18 mistakes had been made because the police seized all the paper work - it was all down in black and white.We had the inquest in early 2011, a [narrative verdict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_verdict) was given. When asked about the abnormal ECG we were told it was probably because my son was tall and thin, but that the machine did not work properly anyway. Another Dr, who discharged my son without reading his notes or seeing him and sent him home with a news score of 4.5 (which is critical) was asked what role was his at Wansbeck, he replied he didn't know. It was a catalogue of errors which cost my son his life.When a Dr was asked why the pathway wasn't followed he argued it was, he was then asked if that was the case why did my son not have the CT scan. After 5 minutes of arguing he said that my son wasn't given the scan because he could have got cancer in later life. An expert witness Dr said that my son could have been saved if they had given him the scan.To my understanding, the Consultant had overruled the GP's letter, an xray showing a patch on my son's lung which was marked by the radiologist, a raised D.Dimer reading and a junior Dr saying he thought it was a blood clot. This was the same member of staff that flippantly told me \"Your son is a young fit lad and I am not worried about him\u201d.", "I am sorry that this experience with us was unsatisfactory and I thank the service user for taking the time to share their views. \r\nDerbyshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust values all feedback and uses it to improve quality and we are always concerned to hear when a service user has had a negative experience and would be keen to hear directly from the individual or their representative. \r\nIt is not possible or appropriate to enter into a public discussion via this forum, but would encourage the service user, or anyone with an issue, to contact our Patient Experience Department.

The nurse said I couldn't have antibiotics as it was not an abscess and it was where my boxer shorts were rubbing against my leg.  I said I was 100% sure it was an abscess and that I needed antibiotics urgently.  We argued for a while.  \r\nWhen I left and told my partner, she was shocked and went back to Frome Hospital and told them that I had a history of getting bad abscesses and I needed antibiotics.  The nurse totally refused.  \r\nAt home I rang my doctor who then contacted the hospital and ordered the nurse to issue antibiotics.  Within 48 hours I saw another doctor who said my abscess was so bad that antibiotics were now too late and said I needed to go straight to Hospital or I would probably die.  \r\nI was in Hospital for days and had to have surgery where they had to drain huge amounts of the poison.

He is fit and active, rides a motorcycle and snow boards.  He knew it was something more serious than a sprain.  On being examined and asked on a scale of 1-10 how painful it was he said 9.  He was sent home with painkillers.  He suffered for 2 weeks, continuing to work and in constant agony.  When he could bear it no longer he visited Chard minor injuries unit.  \r\n\r\nNurse Debbie at Chard Minor Injuries Unit did the simplest of routine test and diagnosed a broken Achilles Tendon.  She was on the phone to a consultant in Yeovil straight away and was recommending surgery immediately.  The following day he saw a consultant, was scanned and it was discovered that 98% of his tendon was unattached!  No wonder he was in pain.  No one could believe he had not been back sooner!  No two people's pain threshold is the same. He was operated on the next day and the surgeon did a beautiful job.  With good physio (which we paid for) and advice from the surgeon he is recovering well.  \r\n\r\nHooray for Chard Minor Injuries Unit is what we say.

We lost our baby daughter at around 18 weeks of pregnancy,\n\nI feel the local birth & aftercare centre had been supportive, after a complete lack of response from our appointed midwife, but after being unable more than once to detect a heartbeat, we were sent to the QA hospital for an ultrasound.\n\nIt confirmed the worst, our daughter had died, likely around a week earlier.  After the traumatic news, we were taken to a quiet room, and promptly, it appeared, completely forgotten for well over an hour, we began to wonder when they would return to explain what needed to happen.  In the mean time, the room we were in had a view of the sonograph room, leaving us to watch others with what appeared much happier news.  We knew my wife would have to go through induction to give birth, as it was too far along in the pregnancy.\n\nWe were given an appointment and returned two days later.  When we arrived, the nurses we spoke too seemed to have no idea who we were or why we were there, let alone seemed to care that we were coming to terms with a loss, rather than being there for an abortion or any other form of treatment.  They were asking us but my wife's name was on the whiteboard right behind them.  I can hardly describe how awkward it was to have to explain that we were there to give birth to our lost daughter.\n\nWe felt the treatment was shocking enough, the pills given, to bring on labour, and the information we were given to read was for an abortion tablet, that's hard to stomach when you would give anything in the world to bring back your baby.\n\nEven worse, we felt the care was so intermittent that my wife eventually gave birth to our daughter alone in the toilet, into a paper bedpan.  We felt from that point on the treatment was abominable.  We were there overnight, and the staff on duty left my wife for the entire night sat in bed in blood, unable to move because of the drip still in her hand.\n\nThe empty drip.\n\nThe empty drip that the night staff we dealt with seemed incapable of removing.\n\nI spent a long time trying to find staff to help during that night, but they never seemed to be around, or no one capable of doing so.

No one seemed to have any idea what to do with us or what instructions to follow for us.\n\nCome the morning, we had to wait until shift change for a Nurse (as opposed to the night staff that seemed unqualified to do anything) to spend all of 2 minutes removing the drip so my wife could finally shower and clean up from the birth.\n\nThe nurse on the morning shift was understanding, but it was, quite frankly far too little, far too late.\n\nPainfully, we were also informed that because we were at the time unmarried, our daughter could only be named after my wife, rather than in my name.  We felt she was in effect, labelled more like medical waste than as a human being.\n\nAnd then to top it all off, despite previous assurances from the nurses we spoke to on arrival, the car park attendant then tried to enforce an overnight parking charge, of around \u00a315, for the time we'd spent there.  I was able to talk him down, but he only gave in he told me because it was a Sunday.

I am a sufferer of long term chronic mental health problems, and in earlier life was frequently admitted to psychiactric wards, until 10 years ago. during the last ten years i was under the care of community mental health teams,and in 2006, i came under the care of the cardiff community mental health team. At the end of 2010, me and my psychiatrist decided to try and see what i would be like without the antipsychotic medication that i had been on for most of my life. i was tapered off it in several weeks, under her direction, but suddenly within a month of coming off, i collapsed at my home, and for want of a a better description, became, suddenly completely incapacitated. my body couldn't stop writhing around, and my voice, of its own accord began coming out in different accents. its was terrifying. \n\nEvidently, it seemed my brain was reacting or had gone into some kind of shock of something.thankfully for me, my mother lives near by, and was i was able to stay with her. during this time, we repeatedly rang the c.m.h.t,  panicking , asking what was happening to me, but they would not let me speak to my psychiatrist, saying she would see me at my outpatient appointment in 3 months time.the family were terrified, as i was unable to feed, wash or be on my own, it was as if i had brain damage, and my mother had to take time off work to care for me. during this time we rung the team also to ask if they knew of any care workers who could look after me so my mother could go to work, and the team  did not get back to us.\n\nIn fact, of the countless times my mother rung asking for help from them, not once did anyone get back to us. On on occasion, my mum was categorically told by a duty worker one day that they did not feel that it was ' appropriate to respond' . my mother then broke down in tears. We felt completely alone, with no help and no answers as to why this was happening. the only thing we could do was hope that it was some kind of withdrawal reaction.\n\nUnfortunately before the outpatient appointment came around, i had escalated into a psychotic mania, and my family had to ring an ambulance to take me to hospital. i was then admitted as an inpatient. the nurses on arrival, were pretty sure i needed to be put back on my tablets , that it was evident. unfortunately, my own psychiatrist was the consultant on the ward, and after giving me a quick test to check i hadn't been brain damaged, discharged me after 2weeks, without stabilising me i.e. i was still very evidently manic, and still speaking in strange accents very fastly. two weeks later at an out patient appointment with the same psych, still presenting as exactly the same, i was told to maybe just ' try and get on with life' , and 'get out and about' and that if people were alarmed at my speech then i was to tell them to 'bear with me'! \n\nShe could give no explanation as to why any of this had happened, but she was sure it would all settle down'.....fast forward to a year later, in which i attempted to kill myself twice, became so isolated due to this neglected state i was in that i stopped eating and lay in bed for weeks, ending up in a paranoid psychosis alternating with mania. i even tried to attack my mother with a knife in this time. all off these incidents were reported to the c.m.h.t, but they did not respond at all, on  one occasion, my mother pleaded with them to give me a cpm, and they said they would 'try and discuss it at their next team meeting' and we never heard anything bk from them. \n\nmy g.p was sympathetic to the way i was being treated and on a number of occasions tried to intervene, but he said unfortunately his hands were tied as it was their area of expertise. the only way i managed to get treated in any of this, was to move out of my area(cardiff) and register with a different g.p. and c.m.h.t. and hope and pray for them to see me and help me. and i had to do all this solely with the help of my mother, who I'm eternally grateful,and would not be here today without. \n\ni was admitted back to hospital in bridgend at the end of 2011 and was thankfully stabilised there after a year of hell, but this was not without its price. As i became more and more demented and paranoid toward the end of the year from lack of help, and what I feel is outright neglect from the services in cardiff, i drank cider for a few days to try and self medicate my illness. as a vulnerable woman, mentally ill and intoxicated, i walked my neighbourhood in the night alone, and in the week that i drank one night i was sexually assaulted and robbed . only then a few days later was i admitted to the hospital in bridgend, were i was treated very well, and finally put back on the tablets that i had needed .i now get seen by this team and my mind is back to normal, but unfortunately, i have a post traumatic stress from the way i was treated in that year. i.e i get nightmares about it, cry every day,and have severe trust issues. with the help of a psychologist, that i am paying privately for, i am slowly having to recover from this now too. i will never forgive the cardiff c.m.h.t and what they did. the only thing that is keeping me join currently is hoping that i will recover enough from the trauma of it, so that i can get involved in campaign work to ensure that no on else  will be treated or left neglectfully in the way i was.

I discovered that I am one of tens of thousands poisoned by a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, the only drugs in this class that interfere with dna.\nThere is a community online which grows by the day, many like me formerly exceptionally fit who are now disabled after prescriptions for chest, sinus or urinary tract infections or no infection at all. There are organisations online which I am unable to cite due to the terms and conditions of this site who are advocates for research which support those harmed by Cipro, Avelox, Levaquin etc.\nAt present Doctors are ignorant of the serious harm these drugs induce in a proportion of patients. Since drug regulatory authorities estimate less than ten percent of adverse reactions are reported the real statistics on serious harm are considerably higher than those reported on warning labels.", "i was admitted in 2010 to the maryon ward oxleas house after having a breakdown. i feel the care i experienced at the time was awful from 70-80% of the ward staff. \ni felt that some of the staff members were reguarly disrespectful, kissing their teeth, turning away - it felt like at times they ignored me, walking away when i tried to talk to them. on occasion my requests to talk were met with a staff member telling me to find someone else because they were busy.\non one occasion i waited at the staff door only to hear them talking about me in a way that i found very disrespectful, and they were laughing. when i opened the door i was told i shouldnt of been listening. \ni raised some issues i had at the time with a worker of MIND, and they said when they approached the staff they felt they were negative about me.\ni was there because i was ill, but ended up feeling more and more worthless due to what i consider to be a lack of care. one menber of staff said they didn't like me, that they were there to do their job and asked me why  i kept trying to reassure myself on if they liked me or not. \non another occassion this member of staff told me if i didnt attend meeting regarding repairs to my flat i would be put to the street. another staff member said after i had self harmed and asked for pain relief that other patients had harmed worse than me and did not ask for pain relief. i was told by another worker i was wasting the nhs money.\ni was diagnosed with unstable borderline personality disorder.\ni was told - not asked and not given an option - to sleep out on a regular basis, which means you dont have a room and have to carry possesions with you until 10 11 12 pm until you are told the bed on the old peoples ward is ready.\non one occassion i had taken a large overdose, and was feeling very sick and was still made to sleep out with a staff member saying that it made no difference where i slept. i was a mess and was accidently sick in the kitchen bin, i was then made to clear my sick up - while staff stood around looking at me in disgust telling me i shouldn't have been sick there and that next time i should go to the toilet (as if i had the choice). \nI was one of a select few asked for a urine sample because some patients were taking drugs on the ward but after questioning why they were asking me, i was told it was for a pregnancy test because I had put on weight?  I may be ill but that doesn't give anyone especially someone in a caring professional role to behave like this. \ni also witnessed a member of staff sleeping while on night duty, effectively being paid while they slept (who is the real waste of nhs money?)\ni believe that most of the staff had very little understanding about people suffering from bpd. \ni was made to sleep with a towel instead of a pillow, priority was given to the couple of long term patients. \ni observed staff eating food that was meant for patients and being secretive about it. \ni believe that some of the christmas ward presents were taken by staff, as were the christmas chocolates and cakes. \ni could go on and on. when i am stronger i will be contacting pals again, maybe even contacting a solicitor about the care i experienced. I don't want anyone else to have to experience the same as i did from people who are meant to be healthcare proffesionals there to help to support and get you better.\n", "My mother went into Belfast city hospital April 2011 and had an operation for Bowel Cancer. Operation went well and she did not need a bag. Operation was done by keyhole surgery, and she was up and about the following day.\nIn the following few days she seemed to go down hill and within 5 days they said she had an infection. The sister came to me and said my Mother had a trace of C-Diff but they were giving her antibiotics. \nShe was much worse by the next day and not very coherent at all and they were moving the other patients out of the ward. The following day I was on my way to hospital when they rang me to come ASAP as my Mother was not well at all. \nThey said she was very poorly and not responding to treatment as she still had all the drips in and the catheter in but you could see she was not passing urine even though she was still getting all these fluids.\nThe following day, the doctor brought me and my aunt into a room and told us that her kidneys were failing and shutting down and she was in a coma like state, she never had a problem with her kidneys but at the time I was not thinking. I am an only child with one parent and I was just told that she would not be there in the morning. \nShe passed away the next day having not woken.\nWhen something like this happens you cant think straight but after the funeral I was going through the paperwork and I was sending her death certificate off, I just looked at it for the 1st time - fully looked and it said she had died of bowel cancer. Well the surgeon had told me they had got it all and it had not spread anywhere, in fact the Monday after the operation they said they were delighted with recovery and thought she might be able to go home on the Friday. Well we know what happened on the Friday and I never did see the surgeon again. \nAs I now understand it, C-Diff infection will cause your kidneys to shut down if they don't catch it on time.\nMy opinion is that the cleaning staff when my Mother was there did not care as they should have done, I watched them while I was there all day, I never saw them doing proper cleaning - they seemed too busy talking, smoking and texting on their phones. My husband, my Aunt and I watched them taking paper towels damping it with cold water and going round this ward that had infection in it and just wiping only the table tops and as far as I know, that was them done. ", "i spent several weeks on iris ward and to be honest i found the experience awful. i found many of the staff rude and abrupt and i didn't feel they considered my feelings as a patient. during my time there i felt i was spoken to like a child and patronised which frustrated me greatly. in my opinion i was treated like my views and opinions counted for nothing.\ni found the consultations a daunting experience, and i often felt like the consultant would not take on board what i was saying and would not listen to how i was feeling.\nwhilst i was on one to one observations i felt the majority of the staff did not give me any dignity whilst i was tending to my personal care, i felt violated at being watched going to the toilet and showering - it felt like a form of abuse.\ni was told that i could be sectioned in a way that i found threatening and told i would be locked in seclusion if i did not co operate which i found to be harsh. in general i felt like the staff i encountered abused their power over the patients and treated me very badly. i feel sorry for other patients who might feel too intimidated to share their experiences - i think something needs to be changed about this ward urgently. \nalso there was a lot of misscommunications between myself and the staff, as well as property going missing which frustrated me greatly.\nin my opinion, any patient who manages to stay sane in this ward deserves a medal!\non a positive note not all staff were bad and i got on really well with some of them.", "Dear evergreen,\r\n \r\nThank you for taking the time to post a comment on the website.

I was on the Safire ward at North Manchester General hospital. I feel that my treatment was disgusting. Many of the staff seemed to only care about looking on the internet, and on once occasion when I asked for my medication I was told to wait, while they ordered something from online. My wait was approximately 20 mins, as they were chatting as well. \n\nWhile I was there, I was told by one member of staff to 'stop putting my illness on' and get on with my life, because my fianc\u00e9 would leave me. This was so insensitive to say to someone with PTSD who had no idea of what was going on. I was constantly fainting because no-one had explained to me how to breath during a mega panic attack. I couldn't eat. I was given a leaflet to read, when I wanted to talk to someone, but I couldn't read it due to my eyes being so blurry due to my fight or flight response. \n\nI was suicidal and I told one of the support workers this. My support worker discharged me when I said this, and then explained how I wouldn't do it - but how could they know! \n\nI feel my treatment was rude, disrespectful and uncaring and made my condition much worse. It would have only taken one of them to sit and talk with me. I had a bad struggle when I was made to leave, depending on family that lived 30 miles away.

His condition was only revealed after his death as a rare, but documented, form of Leukaemia, one symptom being thickening of blood in arteries risking stroke. He suffered a stroke, was given medication for this only two days afterwards, and died the following day.\nAt first the hospital refused to divulge the primary cause of death, and did so only after the inquest had wrongly described the cause of death.", "I have spoke to a couple of the operators who I have been put onto when I've called. Now my Doctor at Millbrook told me that the crisis line was like the samaritains but they specialized in mental health issues, who I could called when I was having \"a bad day\".\nNow the last operator I spoke to told me in no uncertain terms that this wasn't the case, and that the crisis team wasn't a telephone service.

On a Friday evening in March, she had a fall and pressed her alarm, whereupon social services phoned us for help.\nWe managed to pick her up, and as she assured us she was all right, we left.\nLater on she pressed her alarm, as she had fallen again. Social services called us. This time she decided she would like us to call for an ambulance. At her request, we managed to assist her in getting downstairs, where her legs buckled under her, even with her zimmer. We dialled 999 and waited 1 hour and a half before it came. Our neighbour was still on the floor all this time.\nThe following day, she was discharged from A&E and sent home. I helped her indoors.\nLate evening the day after, she pressed her alarm as she had fallen in the kitchen. Again we were called by social services. We went in, and as we were unable to pick her up, we called an ambulance.\nShe was discharged from A&E a day later. A carer came to help.\nThat night she fell, was unable to access her alarm/phone, and lay on the floor of her bedroom until next morning, when she was found by the visiting carer. This time she had sustained some bruising and minor injuries, and an ambulance was called.\nAgain, after a day in hospital, she was discharged from A&E.\nWe expected her a.m. with an assessment team to follow in the afternoon. She arrived after 5pm, exhausted, wanting to wash and change out of nightwear. I helped her upstairs to do this which further fatigued her, and I needed the help of two more neighbours to see her downstairs. The assessment team arrived at 7pm.\nThey assessed her ability to walk with a zimmer, and offered to help her to bed; they couldn't stay or do anything else. Understandably, that's the last thing she wanted. They left.\nMy neighbours made her a drink, then left.\nAt 8pm she phoned to ask me to place her zimmer so it was accessible for the lavatory, which I did.\nAt 10pm she pressed her alarm as she had fallen in the kitchen. Social services called me and I asked them to call an ambulance.\nIt arrived promptly.\nFinally a full week after her original fall, she was admitted to hospital.\nI am writing this because I cannot believe A&E kept sending her home in spite of it being obvious to all involved that she couldn't cope. Why? If it was cost cutting, it probably cost more in ambulance call out. If it was new initiatives which must be followed in every circumstance, then the NHS is doomed.\nAnd what about care? Not much going on there at A&E as far as I can see. Imagine the distress of the patient being shuttled back and forth so many times.\nIf anyone can give me any reasons for this, I'd be glad to hear them.", "I am really sorry to hear about your experience.

She has a history with the mental health services. \nThis time (second in 6 months) Mrs B overdosed and was admitted into the local hospital in Cornwall. She had self referred to mental health team some days prior to this event as she was very afraid of how she felt and was refused an interview by the psychiatrist on duty. \nI am a carer for a person with long term mental and physical health problems but do some caring of this nature too. Her husband/carer has been unsupported for decades. He works away to pay bills leaving his wife alone, afraid and unwell. \nI am of the opinion this is a crutch as they are unsupported and the mental health team are proving ineffective in her case. \nThe hospital discharged this person after taking a large amount of analgesics within 24 hours and put her in a taxi and sent her home alone. No service seemed to see the necessity to engage with her. Her discharge letter was given in her hand to notify her GP which she could not do as had just been so ill. \nI took the discharge letter to her GP, the receptionist informed me that even though this person was on her own and suicidal, the GP had a weekly meeting until 3pm and nothing could be done to change that. No other GP was available. After some diplomacy and debate about priorities and meetings before suicidal patients it was agreed the receptionist would enter the GP meeting to discuss. I did not want to leave this person alone when suicidal but had to leave. \nI was contacted on my journey home roughly one hour later by a different receptionist on my mobile who to me sounded aggressive. I was being told I would have to contact the mental health services, I refused and reiterated I was asking the GP to go out to see the lady. \nHer CPN that same morning had refused to come to the house unable to grasp the difficulties she would have with leaving the house. I could only assume this person was instructed to not to give a home visit, or perhaps there was a shortage of staff? \nThe CPN offered a meeting the following day in a public place which I think was a poor professional decision as the woman was in a dangerous state of mind and in great jeopardy of taking action to end her own life.  I do believe the mental health team are pressured and short staffed and that this CPN may have been told to do this.  The patient then felt abandoned once again by the mental health team. I am limited in what I can reveal as she has not consented to awareness being raised, consequently I can only expose certain failings.\nWithin another day the police had to be called and she was found in a dangerous position, posing serious risk to herself. She was assessed and told by the duty psychiatrist she warranted help but there were no beds in Cornwall.\nThe mental health services in Cornwall seem seriously inadequate to me. Ironically this person has been helping in the community as a service user to raise this issue and has worked hard to improve things. It's my impression that the serious and gravely ill people are not being treated adequately.\nI await with baited breath as I know she is unable to have good insight to what is happening and may still attempt to take her life although she is getting some treatment now. None of it from my perspective has been effective and I question how much longer before we may lose her and she goes in the stats as another case being investigated. \n", "In 2012 I was detained under section 2 of mental health act for about 60 hours within a Coventry located Hospital.  Over the week prior to admission I was informed by my usual treating Consultant Psychiatrist (since 2007) I was experiencing hypomanic symptoms.  My treating consultant took 2 weeks annual leave immediately prior to my compulsory period of hospitalisation.  \n\nMy recollection of early stages of hospitalisation period is limited and derived from information provided to me by my relatives.  Paramedics escorted me via ambulance to the Clinical Decisions Unit University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire in the early hours on Saturday morning.   I was subject to mental health act assessment during inpatient stay on the unit as my blood level concentration of psychotropic medication was elevated.  My psychiatric history includes bipolar affective disorder, PTSD & severe generalised anxiety disorder for which I am prescribed regular psychotropic medication - anticonvulsant, antidepressant, antipsychotic, beta blockers.  Post mental health assessment I was transferred directly to Spencer Ward at Caludon Centre Coventry (General Adult Psychiatry Female Inpatients).   \n\nIt is of concern to me that for the total duration of my inpatient hospitalisation period I received None of medication my GP regularly prescribes to me for my physical health conditions - this includes failure to prescribe me antihypertensives, beta blockers, HRT, IBS symptomatic therapy.   It is well documented in medical text that abrupt ceasation of beta blockers leads to  condition of rebound hypertension - rebound rise in blood pressure.  It is well documented in medical text that abrupt ceasation of HRT in vulnerable patients predisposes to increased agitiation and mood fluctuation \n\nIt is of concern to me that the clinical staff declined to prescribe me the aforementioned physical health medication despite me instructing them in writing the names and dosage of each medication.   This information is relatively easy for me to recall as I have a medical background.  It was also provided to them via my partner who is trained medical practitioner.  I told them I am regularly prescribed aforementioned physical health medication by my GP so experience adverse health consequences if it is rapidly withdrawn and stopped.  Shortly prior to my discharge from Caludon Centre a junior grade psychiatrist on call requested medical advice from physicans at University Hospital regards my significantly heightened blood pressure and prescribed me single dose of amlodipine.  I did not receive clinical interview or physical examination by the admission psychiatric doctor when admitted to mental health unit.\n\nI am instructed the psychiatric clinical team were unable to prescribe me necessary medication for physical health conditions according to my partner.  My relatives were told on direct enquiry by clinical nursing staff working on spencer ward that \n1. My psychiatric (caludon centre) patient case notes were not available as not able be found.\n2.My University Hospital patient case notes could not be transferred to mental health unit over weekend \n2. My GP was not contactable as it was weekend\n3. I did not have prescription from GP documenting prescribed medication with me on admission to mental health unit hospital.\n\nAt discharge I was interviewed briefly via Consultant Psychiatrist whom I had not met before.  I was asked if I wanted to go home and replied yes I did - by this time I felt physically unwell with palpitations, blurred then double vision and headache.   I was not given at discharge any medication or paper work documentation to take to my GP.  Immediately on leaving hospital I went to my GP for support\n\n** My treating Consultant Psychiatrist was on annual leave during total period of my admission - I consider in his absence I received severely compromised and dysfunctional standard of clinical care from treating clinical staff.   \n\nI submit this story in the hope that other patients (and relatives of patients) forcibly detained in mental health unit under section of mental health act for treatment of mental health condition may appreciate the potential difficulties encountered to their existent physical as opposed to mental health.  I found myself in what I felt to be degrading and severely compromising circumstances in which my physical health was deteriorating.  I was physically trapped within  the \"therapeutic environment\" of mental health unit unable to access my habitual GP prescribed medication - I wrote repeatedly to clinical staff over weekend period to access medication with no success!!\n\nI believe my physical health would have been better provided for if my regular treating Consultant Psychiatrist had been available.  In my view the Caludon Centre needs to make better provision for treatment of patients by oncall clinical staff during out of hours period - without this improvement in its clinical service provision patient/s might in my view be subject to serious medical complications.", "We are really concerned for our Mum, who has been under the care of The Somerset Mental Health Team for the past two years suffering with Depression and maybe a Personality Disorder.  She feels, at times, very suicidal and has tried on many occasions to end her life and it affects us tremendously but we feel she gets treated unfairly because nobody knows how to help her in times of distress, so it's always the Police who land the job of looking out to her, by placing her in a cell, like a criminal.\n\nWe feel this has been going on and on and that's the way she's dealt with, no follow-up when they let her go the next day until the next time it happens.  The Police are really good with her but it's not the way to go on - we don't know what to do, in our view nobody listens to her.. or to us, nothing gets done.", "I am glad that you are now getting the help you require but I am sorry that you have had to appeal for the intervention of a senior manager.

", "I was admitted to hospital after visiting my doctor who confirmed that my blood pressure had risen dramatically and protein was visible in my waters. My fianc\u00e9 and I then made our way to the hospital where I was admitted after the midwife on duty confirmed I had +4 protein in my waters and my blood pressure had risen to 178 over 122. I was then confirmed that I had pre-eclampsia and I had to be closely monitored and was told that I wouldn't be discharged until my baby was born.\nDuring my stay I must stress I received exceptional care from the midwives' and nursing team, however the reason for this complaint is due to the care from my consultant and my consultant's team.\nOn numerous occasions the midwives called on my consultant as they were concerned about my health as it was deteriorating dramatically. (I was completely swollen from head to toe with water retention to the point I could barely move, tightening in the chest, headaches and dizziness). \nThe consultant or one of the doctors came and saw me and asked if I was a smoker which I confirmed I was not, and said that the tightening of the chest was due to a cold. Every time I mentioned to the midwives how bad I was feeling they called on my consultant who kept telling me it was a cold I had and the tightening of the chest was not pre-eclampsia.\nI was 35 weeks pregnant and I was also told that they wanted to keep me pregnant until I became 36 weeks as they were concerned that my baby would need to go into special care if I was to have her before 36 weeks and also told me that there was no more room in special care for babies at that time. (I felt they were not interested in me and my health.) A few days later, in the early hours, I broke down to one of the midwives as I became quite scared as I was struggling to breath, I knew something was not right.\nThat morning the midwife on duty called on my consultant and one of the team came and visited me again, and again said they felt the tightening of the chest was a cold. (I did not have a cold!) and again they stressed to me that they needed me to go to 36 weeks before they did anything. During that day I got worse and worse to the point my fianc\u00e9 complained and said that something was seriously wrong and something needed to be done. The decision was then made that they were going to transfer me to QEQM, Margate hospital, it was then decided not to due to my physical health.\nDuring this time there was a changeover of midwives and this particular midwife came to see me and was shocked that I had just been left. She said that she would get me dealt with as she was extremely concerned. (Unfortunately I did not manage to catch her name but if you could find out who she was, please send my thanks).\nWithin 5 minutes, I had 5 members of staff assist me; I was put on 100% oxygen and moved straight down to labour ward. My stats were down to 84 and the staff were concerned for both myself and my baby. I was then told that I was going to be put out while they did the emergency c-section. However as I was being prepared for this and signed the necessary paperwork, the anethesist came to see me and was concerned, due to the lack of oxygen in my blood, I may not make it by being put completely out. The decision was then made to give me a spinal block.\nThe staff that were dealing with me at the time were prompt and professional. After I had had my baby, early hours of the next day. My original consultant and a colleauge came to see me and they tried to justify the reasons why they did not act. (As you can appreciate I was less than impressed and was not interested in what they had to say).\nI was later moved back up to the ward where the midwives were very supportive after what I had been through. I was then told my health was not stable and I was unable to go home. Again the decision of this was left down to the consultant and team. After the neglect I was giving by that team, the last person I wanted to deal with was them. I was eventually discharged the week after.\nSince I have been home, I have struggled emotionally and still find my whole experience very distressing. There was a case on the news in January where a mother gave birth to a baby boy and later died. I know how much my life was at risk and it sickens me that my daughter could have grown up without her mother.\nThe whole experience has affected me in a number of ways and I feel this is down to the way I was just dismissed as if I was just a little girl that didn't know what she was talking about. I also feel if I was older and married I would have been treated with a bit more respect which I find absolutely disgusting.", "Dear relative\nThank you for taking the time to share your experience of Somerset Partnership services on this website.\nThe Trust is very sorry to hear of the difficulties and distress that you have all experienced as a family trying to cope with your mum.\nWe would welcome the opportunity to discuss further your concerns, and if you would like to contact the Patient Advice and Liaison Service, PALS, I will be pleased to see how I can help you.\nMy contact details are:\nKaren Howard-Grenville\nPatient Advice and Liaison Specialist\nTel No: 01278 432022", "We are sorry that the NHS overall didn't live up to your expectations.

Within 5 days she contracted hospital acquired pneumonia. This was treated. They then suspected she had a stroke. They tried to discharge her from the stroke unit. She was unable to walk and barely conscious. We objected strenously and they capitulated. That afternoon she was moved into the medical ward and it was discovered she had a severe chest infection which had returned. The current position is that she is delerious and unable to communicate due to delerium from the infection. They are treating with iv antibiotics. \n\nI have been appalled at the way my mother has been treated, along with medical judgement being seriously lacking as far as I can understand, basic common sense does not seem to have been applied. \n\nIf my mother survives this experience, and I have my doubts about that, I am concerned that other vulnerable elderly patients will be treated like this. The only reason my mother was not discharged in that perilous condition was because she has some very strong advocates in the form of her family.\n\nI believe basic nursing care is lacking. Waiting 2 hours to be taken to the toilet, refusing decent pain relief, trying to discharge a dangerously ill patient, poor hygiene in the parts of the hospital that my mother has been treated in resulting in pneumonia. The food so unappealing that my mother refused to touch it because she was frightened it would make her ill. When so ill she was unable to eat on her own, no help was offered. \nFrom my mother's experience, I believe there is a lack of communication from hospital staff, we have often been unable to speak to the doctor, we have had doctors failing to return calls when our family have expressed concern. I also believe my mother suffered discrimination due to her age. Her hearing aid was broken (by a member of staff) but it was not repaired, I have observed staff failing to recognise my mother's deafness and not ensuring that communicaion was enabled.

There is a lot of talk via TV of people being sent home after hospitalisation and being looked after at home.  This is a new initiative which seems to be about saving hospital beds being blocked. I think this is a bad idea as I can see people dying if left alone.\n\n", "I am sorry to hear that your friend's experience was poor.

We dread our residents going to hospital but sometimes it is inevitable.\nOne of our residents recently spent a week in hospital (actually it was 2 hospitals both part of the same trust).  This resident is in his 80s and frail but had been doing really well in the home, eating and drinking well, happy and contented, free of pressure sores and his skin in good condition despite severe psoriasis.   This resident has a catheter and got an infection that was quite bad, he also has a kidney tumour exasperating the problem.   So he went to hospital for the infection to be treated.  He responded well to treatment within a day or so and we asked for him to come home as we are quite able to care for him with support from District nurses (who, by the way, are wonderful).   It took another week to get him home during which time he was transferred to another hospital.\nWhen he finally came home he was in a very poor state - dehydrated, emaciated and with a bed sore.  His psoriasis was also terrible.\nNo one had helped him to eat or drink, although the family and us had stated he needs help.   No preventative measures had been employed to avoid bed sores and no one had applied cream to his hands or legs for his psoriasis.   He has begged us not to let him go through that again. Sadly the damage is done and he is now so weak and frail that he is on end of life care. I feel like hospitals can be very good a pumping people full of medication but seem to ignore the fact that without the basics of human life e.g. food and drink they will only deteriorate.\nWe love our residents and take great care of them and feel so angry and upset when others show no care or respect.  The excuse is that nurses don't have time to feed people or help them drink - why not?  These should be the basics with everything else secondary.    \n\nSadly this is not an isolated incident as we have other similar stories  and not just from one hospital but 3 in our locality.\nIt is about time the common sense and compassion was put back into our hospitals to stop people suffering and dying needlessly from pure neglect.", "My son was born in this hospital 2 years ago; I have just discovered this website and felt I had to tell my story.\nA week after my son was due my waters broke, I went to the delivery suite and was examined by a midwife, she said my waters had broken and I would be induced within 48 hours to prevent infection to me and the baby. She left the room and came back, said the head midwife didn't think my waters had broke and to go home and come back on my planned day of induction if I still didn't go into labour naturally, I never saw the head midwife she didn't even come into the room I was in.\nFor a week I had regular contractions and dilated 3 cms, I was made to go in every day for a heart trace of the baby, every time they said I had a sleepy baby as his heart rate kept slowing, a consultant was called each time and said trace looks fine send her home. I would then hear the midwives  whispering that they didn't think the trace looked good.\n\n On planned day of induction I was told there was no bed for me on the delivery suite, was taken to delivery next morning. The midwife I was given tried to break my waters, I told her they had all ready broke but she tried anyway, said oh there is no waters there!\nI ended up having an emergency section, during the op the Anaesthetist was arguing with the some of the midwives telling them to shut up, they were also arguing in recovery.\nThe next morning I was on maternity ward, told to get up and go in shower, I was in agony and was shouted at by a midwife for been in so much pain as apparently she had a section and wasn't in pain like I was. I was walked to shower then left. I couldn't bend down to take surgical stockings off so had to call for help, was huffed and puffed at then left again\nI was allowed home the next day, a week later after I'd had the staples removed I felt really unwell, I was shaking and my teeth were chattering, my husband said there was an awful smell and liquid was seeping out of my section wound\nI was told to go to A&E. The staff on A&E were lovely. A Gynaecologist came to see me, she was also lovely, she touched my wound and it exploded. What seemed like litres and litres of puss went all over her, up the walls and on the floor, she said my abdomen had burst\nI was taken back to maternity ward with my son and given 3 bags of blood and intravenous antibiotics. The next day 3 consultants and 2 junior doctors came to see me, they didn't introduce themselves or say what they were going to do. A midwife was told to get forceps, and they whispered amongst themselves, a midwife was told to lift my stomach up (bit over overhang off pregnancy belly ) a junior doctor proceeded to rip open the part of my wound that had healed, I was offered no pain relief or told what they were doing, I was in absolute agony and screaming at them to stop touching me, they then all left the room\nA few hours later a midwife and a auxiliary arrived and told me they needed to get the fluid out of me, this meant the midwife putting both of her hands on my abdomen and pushing as hard as she could, again this was extremely painful and I was crying out and asking her to stop, she didn't, at this point my husband walked in and asked them what the hell they thought they were doing, she walked out with her head down. He went down to the staff room to ask what was going on but nobody seemed to know\nAfter this my husband wouldn't leave me and slept in the private room on a chair for a week, another consultant came to see me, said my wound had broken down and you could see my rectal sheath, he said my wound would have to heal from the inside out then it would have to be sown up again, a lovely midwife arranged for me to have a bottle of gas and air brought to me, I used this the 2 times a day the wound was cleaned and packed\nA week later the consultant came back and said he would \"fix \" me\nI was taken into theatre and my wound was cleaned and repaired, I was in theatre for 4 hours\nit was the worst experience of my life, the way I was treated was an utter disgrace.\n", "I have been in and out of this Hospital in four years.

The Caludon Centre is a mental health hospital located in Coventry West Midlands managed by the Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership Trust.  I am prescribed psychotropic medication for bipolar affective disorder, post traumatic stress disorder and severe chronic anxiety related condition.   \n\nPrior to the easter period 2012 my treating consultant psychiatrist instructed me I was relapsing regards my mental health and developing hypomanic condition.  They told me I must take my prescribed psychotropic medication compliantly as prescribed or I might find myself admitted to Caludon Centre for inpatient therapy.   As they were to take 2 weeks annual leave over easter period they asked psychiatric colleagues to assess / monitor my mental health within the community setting during their annual leave to ensure I remained safe.  I have good therapeutic relationship usually with my treating Consultant Psychiatrist.  \n\nThus 4 members of Caludon Centre psychiatric staff visited me at home - 2 doctors and 2 social workers - I declined to speak with psychiatric staff fearful I might be hospitalised again compulsorily detained under section of mental health act.   \n\nThe psychiatric team in my absence (after I had driven off away from my residential address) had instructed local police force to locate me due to their ongoing concern about stability of my mental health.  Consequently shortly after I returned home and had gone to bed the police officers attended my residential address and as I did not answer front door forced entry into my home.  Police found me drowsy in bed. I live alone.  I had taken additional tablets, extra tablets from my usual prescribed psychotropic medication in an attempt to get to sleep together with some alcohol.   The police officers arranged for me to be immediately transferred via ambulance to Accident and Emergency unit at University Hospital Coventry for further medical physical and mental health assessment.   Later the same day a formal mental health act assessment resulted in my compulsory hospitalisation for further assessment within the Caludon Centre detained under section 2 of the mental health act.    I remained hospitalised within Caludon Centre for less then 48 hours after which I was discharged - I was told to find my own way home where I would stay alone as I live on my own.\n\nSeveral aspects of this admission concern me.  I consider that the treating psychiatric staff could have managed my clinical case better.\n\n1.  I was hospitalised detained under section 2 of mental health act for less then 48 hours.  This is the second occassion this has occurred to me whilst I have mental health service user with Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership Trust.  \n**** A detention under section of the mental health act should not be considered a trivial event as it has statuatory implications for patient concerned including that they are compulsorily hospitalised hence have limitations placed on their personal rights and freedom.   Such a detention under mental health act section remains on my medical record for rest of my life and can have adverse employment or alternative social consequences.   Information about sectioning procedure and detention will be included on my Criminal Records Bureau Disclosure under relevant information section should I request an enhanced CRB disclosure in future to gain voluntary or paid employment.  \n\nOR\nb) I did not need to be detained in hospital at all under section 2 of mental health act - in short the psychiatric team detained me in hospital to avoid making a more detailed comprehensive risk assessment of risk I posed to myself or others - the psychiatric team were not qualified or experienced enough to make such a risk assessment or did not deem it relevant to do so for whatever reason.   I add here that the week immediately post discharge from Caludon Centre was extremely chaotic for me.   I found all of these visits traumatic and embarassing as my neighbours witnessed emergency services repeatedly visiting my residential address for no obvious reason.  I now have to live in my community knowing that most of my neighbourhood know I am mentally deranged at times and this irritates me to extent I prefer to avoid direct contact with them.\n\n2. My next of kin - mother - was not told by mental health team that I was to be discharged from inpatient mental health hospital care on day of discharge - hence it was a surprise to my next of kin to learn of my early discharge from hospital -in practical terms she did not have opportunity to make sure I arrived home safely on day of discharge via phoning me when I got home.\n\n3.  I was discharged without any discharge medication to take when got home or recommendations about what medication to take.  \n\n4. I was discharged without any discharge paperwork to take to my GP to recognise I had been admitted to Caludon Centre.   My GP was not made aware by psychiatric team / hospital staff that I was mentally unwell and had been admitted to mental health hospital.  Hence  my GP was not in a position to arrange to provide additonal support to me post discharge from mental health hospital.  I have very good GP who is supportive if made aware of situation patients find themselves in.  \n\n5. I was not given any written or verbal instructions regards follow up aftercare arrangements I should use post discharge to my recollection.  \n\n At discharge I knew my treating consultant psychiatrist would return from annual leave 12 days later and that I might speak with them then - otherwise I was not given any formal structured follow up plan to follow if I needed support regards my mental health.  ****I receive support from local CMHT community mental health team however one of my support workers was also taking same 2 weeks annual leave easter break as my treating consultant and remainder of CMHT team were less easy to acccess due to easter bank holiday breaks.  ****I receive additional support from a voluntary council funded charity however my usual healthcare support worker is off work due to longterm ill health issues and I had not met my new replacement worker before so did not feel inclined to attend charity facility for support if I was extremely distressed - I find it relatively difficult to trust and relate to new staff initially until I get to know them abit.\n\n6.I was discharged without access to money that was suitable for use on local public transport that I could use to get home.   I was admitted to hospital from home without any personal possessions (no mobile phone, shoes, change of clothes etc.\n\n \nAs a mental health service user with a longstanding history of mental ill health I question the purpose of brief admissions to mental health hospitals under sections of mental health act - compulsory detention in hospital against patients wishes or desire is traumatic and I found it stigmatising, degrading, and felt like a criminal - effectively punished for being in less then in perfect health - instructed in reality I was not able to make my own decisions or judgements as I was mentally unsound.\n\nIt would be advantangeous to me and probably other mental health users if mental health service providers placed more emphasis and gave more consideration to \na) purpose and desired therapeutic outcome of brief periods of detention for patients compulsorily hospitalised under mental health act sections - patients that do not want to be in hospital are less likely to comply with mental health teams proposed therapeutic regimes and may become anti - psychiatric in attitude if patient believes they have no human rights and are compelled to comply with mental health teams recommendations unquestionably\nb) therapeutic plan for period post discharge from hospital as if patient is only hospitalised for brief perid their condition is likely to be similar to that present on admission - and possibly patient may be more distressed in view of forced admission.  If patient lives alone than level of dysfunction that might occur in community post discharge is potentially greater as there are no persons available to limit such dysfunction\n\n\n ", "My Grandmother was admitted for a routine minor procedure on the advice of her consultant.  After the procedure she was fine but was kept in overnight.  Within 24 hours her condition deteriorated, this was written on her notes.  Over the next 12 hours she became very poorly and it seems like nothing was done.\nThe nurses continued to write the notes and say they were only nurses. A doctor never came,  a consultant never came. Within 10 days my Grandmother died.\nShe had gone in there perfectly well, we felt she was given little attention after her operation and totally neglected due to her age.

We have support workers across the UK, providing information, advice and support to people affected by stroke. Our services are funded by PCTs or social services and we receive referrals from hospitals, social services, friends and family and self referrals so we can support people affected by stroke from the moment of diagnosis. Sadly, not all areas provide funding for these services so we also campaign to raise awareness about stroke, demonstrating the need for our services, and encourage people to understand more about the long term affects of stroke.\r\nWe try to reach everyone who needs us, either through our publications or advertisements, which list our helpline number. \r\n\r\nWe also direct people to crucial services such as, ICAS an advocacy service for vulnerable people who wish to make a complaint about health and social care. https://icas.org.uk/default.aspx\r\nAs well as organisations like Age UK, who work endlessly to improve services and support for older people. https://www.ageuk.org.uk/\r\n\r\nI was sorry to read about your mother's health care problems and her suspected stroke.

The cause of a stroke can be a bleed (haemorrhagic stroke) or blockage (ischaemic stroke) in the brain. Because the brain controls everything that the body does the damage to the brain will affect bodily functions. The effects can be physical, psychological and/or cognitive.\r\nI have attached a leaflet about this for you to read if you need more information about stroke: \r\nhttps://www.stroke.org.uk/about/what-is-a-stroke\r\n\r\nIt sounds like you are not happy with the treatment your mother received.

As a stroke survivor the shoulder should have been investigated, she had also lost the use of her other hand, suddenly. Having allowed her to become so distressed due to the poorly controlled pain, she was crying out, pleading for God to help her. It was inhumane and lacked any dignity.\nHer physical and emotional state deteriorated at an alarming rate. She developed a large, deep pressure area requiring dressing. She was pushed through the corridors to the dressing area, often terrified & begging to die, to gain some relief. She remained in this state for many days. Our sister had to stay with her virtually 24 hours, to try to calm her.\nOn one occasion she was moved from her bed without the use of the hoist, which was supposed to have been used & was available. Due to her distress & deterioration I contacted the Adult Safeguarding team, as we were so concerned, who became involved.We were assured the situation would improve. Apologies were offered but she was so tormented by now.\nOne evening, some weeks later, she was declared nil by mouth due to a choking episode but nearly 24 hours passed without medication or fluids until we complained again. It was an horrendous situation.\nMany of the staff were wonderful, they were so understaffed but not enough questions were asked as to why this lady was in this state. Thankfully she became more comfortable in her final days, but the pressure area had deteriorated greatly.\nShe passed away in February 2010. The distress she experienced was undignified, terrified of being moved due to being in pain. Inadequate care.", "I was assigned to a Consultant at this practice after BUPA refused to pay for psychotherapy/further help (despite a comprehensive corporate-level subscription).\n\nThe Consultant was late, in my view, uninterested, spent only 25 minutes of ('up to 90 minutes' per the letter) first appointment and, after that (short) time pronounced that I was fine albeit they wrote and confirmed my diagnosis of BP2 to my GP. When I told my GP that I was unimpressed (I have reason to be very visual and good at assessing people from other disabilities/a previous career) they chided me telling me these people work very hard you know (they all seem to be on holiday when I need help). So I kept seeing them. In my opinion this nearly cost me my life; had I followed this Consultant's timescale, method and timing for an SNRI withdrawal I think I would have not seen 2011 New Year's Eve.\n\nMuch distress and too many drugs later it has just been confirmed that my diagnosis was wrong and I should never have been on the drugs that in my view took away my life for the last 18months-2 years. \n\nThis mental health unit is shabby, chaotic and has been disgraceful in it's lack of attention to what I was saying (I knew there was something wrong but felt was ignored).\n\nBased on my experience I would not recommend it.", "In my opinion the maternity unit is a disgrace. The midwifes who treated me complained about being busy all the time. Not even offered water all day.\nI felt like the people around me didn't know what they are doing. I would buzz to get someone and they come in, turn the buzzer off and say \"back in a minute\" and I had to buzz again an hour later. Happened all the time.

", "In recent times I've tried to ignore the stories I hear about how bad Milton Keynes hospital is. I've been encouraged by reports that changes for the better have been made, and maybe they have. Recently however, I had the \u2018opportunity' to experience the place for myself as a patient and in the textspeak du jour all I can say is, OMG!\nOn a recent Thursday I began experiencing stomach pains which by Saturday had become unbearable so after calling my doctor's surgery was advised to go to the Walk In Centre at the hospital. After spending two hours there they sent me to the Surgical Assessment Unit (SAU) on the first floor of the hospital. Almost the first thing I was told was that I shouldn't have become ill on a weekend, and especially not on a bank holiday weekend \u2013 which it was.\nI waited a further ten hours to see a doctor and have some simple blood texts, before being admitted, given some IV antibiotics and oral painkillers and left to my own devices with no information in a largely unmade bed. The only greeting was from other patients.\nIn the morning I received more antibiotics, an x-ray which they then lost (yes, really) for several hours, a further x-ray and then nothing. The following morning (Sunday) I finally received a visit from a lady consultant (apparently I'd been put under her \u2018Breast Team' \u2013 yes really) who told me I would get a CT scan that morning. I didn't.\nHer junior, after complaining about their boss loudly to anyone who'd listen and after several hours of very hard pushing from me, finally organised the only CT scan of the day, into which session they also slotted an urgent female patient from casualty. The story the whole time was \u2018It's a weekend. It's a bank holiday weekend. What do you expect?' Well actually I expect the NHS to deliver healthcare. Tesco's was open. Why not the hospital?\nFinally I was allowed to eat. However the food is the most unhealthy, unappetising and poorest quality imaginable. When they did succumb to an attempt at healthiness, for instance with a token piece of fruit, the pear I received was an inedible rock. \nI was constantly moved, not spending one night out of the three I spent in hell, in a single location. Eventually I found myself in Ward 20, whose staff seemed to specialise in criticising the methods and knowledge of the SAU ward staff. Minutes after my arrival in the ward, I witnessed a larger elderly gentlemen sitting in a chair by his bed wearing two inadequately small hospital gowns, one behind like a coat, one in front providing modesty.\nHe was asked to remove these for the laundry and was helped to strip. He had no underwear. He was then unceremoniously handed folded clean ones which he then had to change into, in full view of everyone coming and going on the ward, without any assistance. His curtains were not pulled, something he clearly couldn't do himself. Where is the simple dignity?\nOn another occasion I saw a nursing assistant helping to feed a man who never left his bed the entire time I was there. The assistant sneezed voluminously over the food, making no effort to cover their mouth, and simply kept feeding it to the patient. I gagged. I suspect inwardly the patient did too. \nOn the Monday night at about 7pm a fellow patient, presumably just fitted with a body waste bag, had a nasty accident in the only male shower room on the ward. He was forced to beg for some clean gowns and was clearly deeply embarrassed. The nursing staff went into the shower room with much tutting and sucking of teeth and placed some absorbent sheets of a disposable nature over the nine or so square feet of highly offensive poo slick and simply left it there to fester. It was still there in the morning at 7am, some twelve hours later, when I went in to use the shower. I pointed this out to a nurse from the morning shift who was highly critical of her \u2018lazy' colleagues.\nI was invited to use the ladies shower room which unlike all the gents I'd sampled in my travels has a sink plug so you can shave properly (although the mirror is on the opposite wall), has cold water for brushing your teeth and a shower which actually has a decent flow. Lucky ladies. Go breast team!\nFinally I, in concert with another patient also desperate to go, was forced to tell the staff that I was a very reluctant bed blocker and must be released or I would walk. I didn't even have to take out of my arm the final and seventh version of the endlessly leaking and self-ejecting canulas, as it fell out by itself like all its predecessors. As I write, I look like a bruised pin cushion. They issued oral antibiotics and let me go. You will be pleased to hear that I survived MK hospital. You might not however, and sadly a body was removed from my ward while I was there.\nIn my time there I never received any kind of \u2018orientation', any information or even a printed sheet with details of where the emergency button was or how to use it, or even where the toilets were, or visiting hours which change ward to ward or what to expect or when. Since staff I met never volunteered any information about my treatment I took to questioning them, when I could find anyone to give me eye contact, and this is how I discovered that, when pushed for an answer some people blatantly lie. Sorry, but that was my overwhelming experience of the staff interactions. \nI have really only touched the surface of the lack of information, constantly broken promises, poor treatment, contempt of patients and in-house petty rivalries and turf wars I witnessed in my four days of hell at MK hospital. And yes there are good people working there, but in my view they are swimming against a very strong tide.", "I'm not satisfied with the service provided at my GP practice and am going to change to a different practice.  I have found the appointment system frustrating and some of the staff unhelpful - phoned yesterday for an appointment and told there weren't any - I'd have to have a phonecall consultation this morning, but it would be first thing (I think this was said in an accusing tone and I felt that it was implied that I was a layabout).  I pointed out I could barely speak and phonecalls are difficult at the moment, to no avail.  Phoned up this morning, and hey presto, two appointments with a GP were magically available.  I think this is a ridiculous system!  \n\nAm also concerned about treatment provided by GPs - my boyfriend had severe digestive problems last year (needing toilet 30 times a day) and kept being repeatedly sent away by GP and told to wait another 6 weeks for hospital appointment.  He ended up requiring emergency surgery to remove his entire colon, which I believe could possibly have been prevented if treatment / referral had been prompter.

No tests were performed. I started to lose a lot of blood and had a student nurse who started flapping her arms about and asked me what she had to do.\nI saw a doctor eventually, after I complained, and eventually had a scan which confirmed that my baby had died.

I tried to call an ambulance and was told that because its part of his pre-existing condition it was not an emergency and I had to contact his GP. \nI rang the GP and they refused to speak to me.

He was never treated for that injury and so now has lost the use of his left arm.\nThe same thing happened again in 2009. I tried again to get him help, and again the Drs refused to attend despite the ambulance crew calling the doctors for two hours. Now the doctors surgery refuses to treat my son or myself. Apparently this is perfectly legal.\nMy son fell again two weeks ago and had a suspected fractured hip. The ambulance crew felt that it was sufficiently serious to warrant medical assessment and this time he was taken to the local hospital. This time the hospital refused to treat my son.\nHe had to endure six hours lying on a trolley and the nurses caring for him refused to give him pain medication, and the doctors to assess him. They wouldn't even take his obs or register him - he was just left as if he was a slab of meat.\nAfter those six hours the doctor discharged him with no treatment, as he said that because my son has no GP they can't treat him!\nWe are normal British citizens, we are not foreign to this country and yet we are both now being denied access to medical care. I have tried everything I can to resolve this situation to no avail. I can't get a solicitor to fight this, as no solicitor will take this on. I don't want to have to fight through the courts just to be able to access the GP.\nIn my experience there is no adequate care for severely disabled people, and the treatment of carers like myself by some GPs in Norfolk has been frankly appalling.", "I am writing on behalf of my son who was admitted to the Caludon Centre under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act in 2011. This is our first experience of the new acute services for Rugby where according to earlier press releases we were promised much;- \n\n\u2022\t\u201cThe changes will mean better access for patients and carers to the right mental health services at the right time\u201d.\n\u2022\t\u201cMoving the in-patient facilities into the new purpose-built Caludon Centre is essential to ensure the right mental health services for the people of Warwickshire.\u201d\n\u2022\t\u201cMoving the in-patient facilities to the Caludon Centre will mean that patients can be treated in a new purpose-built unit that is more suitable for providing modern mental health care\u201d.\n\u2022\t\u201cWe have listened carefully to what people have said about these proposals and we support the option which will provide better access to safer, high quality mental health services for local people.\u201d\nMy son was initially admitted on a voluntary basis early in the year but was discharged 3 days later because of inappropriate behaviour, despite protests from the Community team that they had not been given time to put things in place for his return. He was admitted again to the Caludon Centre under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act 2 days later. \nOn one of my visits later in that month I arrived on the ward in the evening to find that in the words of the nurse he is off the ward. I was assured by the staff that he would only be away for 30 minutes. I waited almost 2 hours before leaving and asked the staff what would happen now, I was told that he had probably gone to the pub and that if he wasn't back in the next hour he would be brought back by the police. Is this what is meant by Modern Mental Health care? \nI subsequently understand from a member of staff that he was eventually returned to the ward around midnight brought back by the Police from his home. \nThe question needs to be asked how a patient under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act, who shortly before had to be escorted by 2 people within the hospital to the coffee shop, was suddenly allowed out of the hospital for free periods of 30 minutes?\nI am so disappointed with the care received so far, this is not the service we were promised, I don't feel that my son's condition has been fully understood or has it been recognised how quickly his mental health can deteriorate if he does not receive the appropriate care.  This should not happen as I understand that all of my son's previous records can be accessed electronically. \nI have just finished piecing together my Son's movements during the week before being admitted to the Caludon Centre. It appears he was rampaging with a semi dangerous weapon before being picked up by the police; this could have ended so badly. He made unwise decisions with his money that week also, spending a lot of money. So far I don't know where he got the money but I think it will turn out to be a bank loan which raises the question of how a bank can lend money to someone so clearly ill and also on benefits.\nIt was a great relief that he was finally detained so that he could receive the care he so desperately needs. However this was not before he had completely trashed his flat for the second time. The council flat is so bad this time that I am unable to put it right and if this is not done he is at risk of being evicted as it is clearly a Public health issue. Imagine my dismay when my son was discharged from Hospital two days after being admitted to go back to this horrendous mess which by the way is still in this condition.\nThis present acute episode has been developing since he voluntarily underwent an Alcohol detox in 2011 in order to get his life together. We had 2 fantastic months when he was without alcohol, was functioning well and really getting himself together. However after years of alcohol abuse I believe the abstinence has taken its toll of his mental health and he has found it increasingly difficult to cope and has finally resorted to other substances to replace the alcohol leading to his present condition. He was still not drinking when he was admitted to the centre and had been regularly attending AA meetings and was doing an adult learning class.\n\nSince the last acute episode many years ago, the Community team have worked tirelessly to help maintain my son's function in the community. It was only in the last weeks before he was admitted that the Crisis Team were involved in monitoring his care on a daily basis as he wasn't taking his medication as prescribed. \n\nI subsequently made a formal complaint to the hospital and the Care Quality Commission and received a letter of apology from the hospital about the lapses in the acute care given.\n", "hello please take some time to read this and reply. \nMy mother was admitted into hospital 2 weeks ago and unfortunately passed away a week ago. We think this is due to the careless nature of some of the nurses and doctors. First when we went to the doctor's surgery in Slough, they diagnosed her with just a cough and we were sent away for 8 weeks. She was given an inhaler, but we went back as it was not good and caused reactions, but they gave us the same response again. When we went to the hospital a&e, as she was coughing up blood, we were sent back home. \nFor 1 week my mom was coughing up blood and even had an ambulance take her to hospital at 2am \u2013 but they just sent her home, saying she had breathing problems. After that the doctors gave her a letter to be admitted to hospital \u2013 then only did she go to the AMU, where she had the suspected diagnosis of TB. \nAfter a while, she was moved into the paragon suite. There she received absolutely terrible treatment \u2013 from what we saw, most of the nurses did not seem to care about her. Nurses would take their time if she rang the bell and did not give much help. She told us herself the treatment was rubbish. \nThe doctors kept taking her blood and did not give her any more despite knowing she was low on blood, as she did die when blood was being taken out of her. She was said to have TB and being treated for that, but after we were informed her lungs collapsed and heart failed. Now after her 1st post-mortem, they have still not found the cause of death. \nI now want to know how they did not know what she was suffering from, and why she was sent home so many times and not treated earlier? Why was the care so poor, and why were they taking her blood for tests, after taking so much and not caring to give her more? And why did her doctor's surgery not send her to hospital when she was coughing up blood? And why the hospital were not caring for her on our first visit, when they took chest xrays, but sent her home anyway? Now what sort of care and hospital care is this?", "Thank you for sharing your story with us.

I asked for a referral to the Muscular Skeletal team for advice on correct posture and ways of coping in April 2007. Whilst waiting for this appointment I saw an orthopaedic surgeon privately who arranged a spinal x-ray and MRI scan. It was found that I had two severely herniated discs and showed signs of cauda equine which is a \"red flag\" indicator of the need for urgent medical attention. I had NHS surgery in October 2007 when I was told I was to remain flat in bed for the first 48 hours and in hospital for a further 48 hours. The nurses insisted I got out of bed much too early despite my protests that I was to remain flat and I was discharged in less than 48 hours. Sadly I have been left with significant nerve damage and constant pain. I tried to return to work on very much reduced hours but was retired on ill health grounds in January of this year. I will always wonder if I had received the correct diagnosis at the beginning and had been left flat for the first 48 hours after surgery if the outcome would have been different. I would much prefer to still be working and earning my own living instead of living off a very small pension and benefits. After surgery I seriously considered suicide as I felt I was of no use to anyone and without the unfailing support of my family and friends would not be here today.", "I'm a male in my 30s and in 2008 I had an accident at work, fractured my femur in my left hip which over the next 12 months I developed a vascular necrosis which meant I needed hip replacement.\nFirst I was told by a consultant that I'm too young and won't get one then was called back to hospital to see different consultant to the operation was going ahead which I was pleased with.\nI had the first op then 3 months later started to develop pain in my hip and feelings move and told its fine nothing wrong with the hip the problem was I had gout in my knee so they treated the mystery gout.\nThen I went to see a private consultant to which he recommend that the hip could be loose and needed investigating with a ultra sound scan and radioactive bone scan so then I was due an appointment with my consultant at Tameside to which all they wanted to was sit and wait to see if it improved so I showed them the report from private consultant which they dismissed and sent me for X-ray when I returned from X-ray they say can I see your report again to which read then arranged the test to which proved the hip was loose then in December 2011 hip revision surgery to which up until now had been really good but since start July 2012 the hip feels like its loose again.\nI've been to my gp he said leave ten days see if it settles ten days passed no change so on chance I phoned Tameside about an appointment to my surprise they can fit me in, they can check my hip when go I see same consultant and tell how it is, so sent X-ray which they says is good nothing wrong go home see you in one year and I will tell your gp you need to see a back consultant to which I laugh inside as the same consultant said I had gout when my hip was loose last now they say bad back I'm thinking of completely changing hospitals.", "I am a carer of a family member who recently experienced mental distress and went into Lomond Ward, Stratheden Hospital. The staff seemed to be too busy to take time with my relative, the ward was chaotic and other patients were agitated and distressed. My relative ended up being restrained and forcibly treated, incurring an injury and being transferred to the IPCU, a locked ward. \n\nWhere my relative was locked in a room all night, no toilet or water to drink, with the injury and not knowing where they were. I was not informed of the injury until a few days later. When I did try to photograph the injury and the bruises, I was surrounded by 5 nurses who I felt bullied and intimidated me. And wouldn't allow me to use my camera. \n\nThe IPCU is 'not fit for purpose', according to the Mental Welfare Commission and yet it appears nothing has been done to improve the conditions for patients there. They are not allowed pens to write with, unless supervised by 2 nurses in the activity room, which is kept locked and only open at certain times. Most of the rooms in this ward are kept locked. As a visitor I had to enter by the back door, through a number of locked doors and the staff kitchen. Meeting with my relative in the dining room and overlooked by various staff, either eating a snack, passing through or even washing the floor around my feet. \n\nNurses in the IPCU even rolled their own cigarettes in front of patients. Meanwhile patients were left to their own devices in the smoking room.  No-one to supervise them. Vulnerable patients at risk of physical injury and mental anguish. The only water available to drink was in the dining room which was locked, so no ongoing access to liquids. \n\nMy relative was transferred back to Lomond Ward. Where vulnerable patients were not properly supervised. One woman who had an observation room was found late at night in the male dormitory. My relative woke up to find her coming out from under his bed. No nurses to be seen. The police were often in the wards at Stratheden Hospital. Like sheriffs restoring law and order. But very distressing for patients and carers. \n\nI think that some of the psychiatric nurses at Stratheden Hospital need training in de-escalation skills. How to reduce the mental distress of patients. Rather than using force and heavy handedness. Then there would be less need for police intervention. The nurses were often in the staff room writing notes, making phone calls, having meetings and chatting to one another. I saw little interaction with patients except when the patients queued up at the drug trolley, 4 times a day. \n\nI have made a complaint to NHS Fife about the lack of duty of care, the poor treatment and human rights abuses, experienced by my relative in Stratheden Hospital. I am not confident of a fair or just outcome. I think that the voices of patients and carers are not respected and therefore the psychiatric establishment not accountable.\n\n", "My father initially entered ward 4 and did very well there, he progressed so well that he was transferred to ward 3 for rehabilitation. Within the first week in that ward his condition had deteriorated back to pre-admission levels, there appeared to be no communication between nursing teams and the concerns and experiences of the family were ignored to the point that a urine infection was ignored for three days and sedation was administered as the patient was being 'difficult'. Our concerns are 'being addressed' however we are not confident about my fathers care now or in the forseeable future.", "Thank you for taking the time to provide the Trust with details of your experiences.

The care in hospital was excellent.\nOnce he was discharged that is when his problems started. \nHe was discharged with no antibotics and no dressings. After 2 weeks we could both see that his recovery was not as it should have been and his health was deteriorating. After several phone calls to the consultant's secretary to try and speak to the consultant who performed the operation, I was told that the consultant 'doesn't talk to the general public' and was told to go back to the GP. We eventually got an appointment with the consultant.\nThey said they would order an urgent scan and that the problem was 'bruising' from the operation'. 2 weeks we waited for the URGENT scan - and all that time his health was getting worse.\nThe radiologist who did the scan took one look at him and immediately said he had an infection and that she would put that in her notes.\n3 days after the scan, I phoned the secretary to see what the scan showed. The message from the consultant was 'post op inflammation' and they would see him in August.\nMy husband was admitted to A/E again in July and operated on again 2 days later. The infection had turned to abscess, and they had to remove one of his testicles.\nA formal complaint will be lodged and we will also be taking legal advice. Why am I having to describe my husband 'private parts' with a secretary? Why was nothing done for him sooner after several phone calls to get something done? Why was he discharged from hospital without antibotic/dressings?\nHe lost his testicle - and if something had been done sooner, before the infection took hold, and after 6 weeks we were still being told it was bruising from the op, he would not have been admitted again and go through another operation.", "Thank you for your feedback, I was very sorry to read that you were so unhappy with the care and treatment offered to your father, I can see that you have formalised these concerns and I hope that your concerns are addressed fully and to your satisfaction through this process.\r\n\r\nPaul", "Thank you for your  feedback.

With a pre-existing immunological condition, I was also given extra scans and appointments at clinic with one of the registrars - who was excellent. \nUnfortunately, in my third trimester, my blood pressure started to creep up. The risk for pre-eclampsia was slightly higher for me given my health, and this was explained very clearly to me. My antenatal care was then transferred from the community midwife to the midwifes in the hospital, who were wonderful, patient and caring, despite a very busy department! ! \nThe bad experience, unfortunately, was my labour itself. At 38 weeks, with rising blood pressure, the registrar decided it was best to induce me, and arraged for me to be admitted the following day. I arrived at the ward at 2pm, and the midwife attending to me explained that I would be given a pessary drug to soften my cervix, would be monitored via CTG, and would likely start IV drugs the following morning to induce contractions. I was happy with this explanation and knew what to expect. I was given the pessary about 5pm. My observations at this time were - very busy ward - clearly someone was in labour that I could hear - a few other unwell patients earlier in pregancy, I was in no way a priority and totally understood that, happy to read my book and let the girls get on with it. (I am a health professional working on wards, Know what it can be like! ) I started experiencing a mild cramping around 7.30pm while my husband was with me during visiting hours. By this time the midwives had changed shift. I informed the midwife looking after me, she explained this was normal, and often a reaction to the pessary.  So okay, fine, as long as everything's okay. This worsened during visiting, and again was told this was normal. My husband left at the end of visiting, being a closed ward, and I proceeded to pace the floors for the next three hours, as I was too uncomfortable to sit still. I was then rudely told by an auxilliary nurse to go to bed! I was put back on the monitor routinely, but had to buzz the midwives to say that I was unable to stay in one position as I was in too much pain. I asked if I could be in labour, she said no, just the baby moving now that my cervix had been prepared. \nThe next hour and a half were a mess with me continually at the desk reporting\n- I am in a lot of pain, are you sure this is normal? \n- I feel nauseous, and I've just been sick\n- I am now bleeding\nThe responses  were a mixture of, the babys head engaging, it's just your show, try to get some sleep, you'll feel better. I appreciate that first time mums are probably very anxious about everything, and I know that first labours are usually long, and inductions are usually long, but clealy I was distressed and at no point was given any reassurance. In fact, I was made to feel more like I was a nuisance. \n\nI was in a four-bedded bay, with three peacefully sleeping women, locked myself in a toilet to try and keep quiet. Only when I was standing at the desk, doubled over with my legs crossed, saying \"I am telling you, I need to push\", did she actually (patronisingly) offer to examine me. Within a microsecond of me on the bed, her face said it all. \"You're fully dilated! \" I handed her my phone to call my husband.  At 2.17 am, she took the brakes off the bed and proceeded to wheel it herself. As I said, I work in the wards, so I know how difficult that is- ran into someone else from another ward in the corridor who helped her run with the bed. In the lift, she said to me, \"You were awfully quiet! \" I am not sure what I was supposed to say that. \nArrived at labour suite, where a midwife, my saviour of the evening took over. Armed with quick responses and professionalism, I immediately felt in safe hands. She spoke to me directly, explained the baby was very distressed because everything was happening so fast, her heart beat was dropping rapidly etc, so they were going to do an episiotomy to speed things up. Two pushes, done. My beautiful daughter was born.  She was a bit blue at first, needed oxygen, her first Apgar score was low, but picked up quickly, and is perfectly healthy. And my husband missed everything!  He arrived eight minutes later. I know sometimes that can't be avoided, but in this case it could have! He can never get that back. People said to me at the time, shame he wasn't there to rub your back, hold your hand, help you push etc. More upsetting was the fact that I had no one, not even a midwife saying, 'great, 7cm, just a little bit longer', nothing... AND, might I add, not one drop of pain relief was given! \nBeing so angry about it all initially, was quickly lost with the joy of my new baby girl. I almost feel silly writing about this now, she's 19 months! However, I always felt I wanted to share my comments without making a formal complaint. I was fine, she was fine, once you're home that experience fades, but we both could have had a very different outcome.

Buzzers were being ignored or patients told to wait as they were busy and would return asap. Which they rarely did. I complained to senior nurse about my mothers buzzer being placed out of her reach, hearing aids not being put in, her teeth not brushed, hair not combed, requests for toilet visit ignored and finding my mother very distressed as she had soiled herself. \nNurses seemed so understaffed that it was impossible for them to give the time required to attend to the needs of elderly patients who were hard of hearing or took longer to respond. Due to her level of disability I spent many hours on ward with my mother every day. I witnessed many incidents that I found totally unacceptable. \nI do understand that staff have a very difficult job to do under stressful conditions.

Said that was why she had a headache. She was discharged about 4 hours after having arrived.\nMy mother is 84 yrs old, she was staying with me and we were keeping an eye on her. \nWe got her to bed but she woke up shortly afterwards screaming with the head pain, tried to give her the antibiotic but she was vomiting the tablet back. \nI then rang her doctor explaining that East Surrey had discharged her, he sounded shocked and said to get her back there. \n\nI made the decision based on what I had seen to drive her to her own hospital which took another 15 mins in time. It was there that she was given a more detailed examination, a CT scan and was diagnosed with a bleed on the brain.\n\nMy mother subsequently spent time in The Hyper Acute Stroke Unit in a deep unconscious state, and has since died - this being the cause.

The ward was put under special measures, which we understand is because of concerns around patient care (though it was explained to us that this was not just due to the care our father received).", "I was very sorry to read that your experience of your mother's care in the Larkfield Unit was so negative and that you had a range of concerns about how her care was being provided.\n\nI have passed this posting on to the Director responsible for the service provided in that Unit so that she is aware of these concerns and can take these forward with staff in the Unit.\n\nIt would be very helpful, however, to have some more detail so that we can investigate this more fully, and respond to you formally.\n\nIf you are able to provide these details to \n\ncomplaints@ggc.scot.nhs.uk\n\nThis will allow us to take these forward.\n\nThank you for sharing your experience, I very much hope that you are able to provide more detail so that we can discuss these concerns with you and seek to improve matters for your mother, and for other patients. \n\nPaul", "Thank you for providing your very detailed feedback, I was sorry to read that the experience was both good and bad, and that there were aspects that you remain, even to this day, unhappy about.

It sounds devastating that you will never know if things could have been different, had East Surrey Hospital acted differently. \r\n\r\nFrom what you have written, it sounds like your mother had a subarachnoid haemorrhage, which is a bleed over the surface of the brain. A common symptom of this is a sudden, very severe headache. This is often a very serious type of stroke and sadly, about half of people who have a subarachnoid haemorrhage will die. That said, there are some operations that might have been considered. As we are not medically trained, it is difficult for us to say whether your mother would have been suitable for an operation or if this would have changed the outcome. Perhaps it would help to discuss this with East Surrey Hospital. You could speak to their Patient Advice and Liaison Service, who can put questions to medical staff on your behalf and give you advice on the hospital's complaints procedure if you feel you want to go down this route.

To her credit she was and has finished a year at college retaking A levels, but at what price for those around her. there is no transition services it has been straight into an adult team for a young adult who lost almost 2 years to her mental health problems so had no resources of a adult to call on. \nIn our view there has been no family support for reintroducing a member back into a family, apart from a charity which has proved patchy and not around at times of crisis. Every one asks have you had a carers assessment but having had one it seems like it brings nothing at the end but a box tick. \nSadly my daughter have had periods with no CPN often at times of forseeable difficulties which we have been left to cope with, despite service responisbilities post section. \nNo one is interested if you do manage to screw up courage to feedback how things are going. During the most recent problems it was admitted to me I was monitoring yet no one told me this or asked if I was willing or had the personal strength and I had no faith from previous experience I would be listened to. \nSadly at one point the crisis team said the problem was not one they dealt with and recently failed to act when asked to by the recovery team. No one in the family patient or carer believe they are worth using\nRecently my daughter said she had never feltsupported since her discharge\nThe cost a now broken family and ill health for the primary carer, why no transition services and realistic family support which would have prevented much and enabled the patient to take on more repsonisibilites for herself and her conditon. \non balance her in patient care was difficult at times but lead by professionalism and compassion, at times there are good pockets but not frequently and this seems to be when all is going well.\n", "We are sorry to hear of the difficulties that have been experienced and thank you for sharing your story with us.\r\n\r\nOur Head of Community Services has advised that there should always be a transition period when someone is leaving CAMHS to enter adult services.   The age for this is between 16 and 18, at the Care Coordinators discretion.  We would expect the receiving service to be invited to patient reviews (CPA or other) and a transition plan agreed.  As part of this a handover period would be agreed and there may be some joint-working.  The appropriate receiving team should in-reach into Ash Villa prior to discharge.  Support for reintroducing the patient into the family would be best discussed prior to discharge.\r\n\r\nHowever if IAPT is required (Improved Access to Psychological Therapies), this would not be the case and a referral would be made to them and they arrange an assessment in one of their bases.\r\n\r\nAlso, if inpatient care was still required we would expect them to be transferred to an adult inpatient unit rather than discharged to the community.\r\n\r\nThe Carers assessment should be more than a tick-box exercise and there are Carer support groups who are best placed to provide general support for a carer.  We can assist in putting them in touch with such a group in their local area.  The CPN would have interaction with the carer though and be supportive particularly around education and understanding of the patient's condition.  However, we would need the patients consent to do this and sometimes that isn't always forthcoming.\r\n\r\nWithout further details we cannot be any more specific I'm afraid.  If you want to get in touch with us our Head of Community Services will gladly look at the individual circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn respect of the specific issue relating to the Crisis and Home Treatment Team (CRHT), without any details of what the presenting \u201cproblem\u201d was or what the Recovery Team was requesting of which Team it is very difficult to provide a meaningful response because we do not know the facts and it would be wrong of us to make assumptions.\r\n\r\nIf you feel able to provide sufficient information or have a conversation with someone you would be comfortable talking with then our Head of Acute Care would be happy to look at the details of the case.  In the absence of any further details he has offered his apologies for the experience you have described.  In addition, he would hope the Recovery Team and CPN involved would have raised any concerns they had with the request they made to CRHT as part of their professional code of conduct and if they were not satisfied with the outcome then escalated it through the line management process.  \r\n\r\nWhilst not a very positive experience for you and your family, we remain committed in working with Service Users, Carers and relatives and stakeholder groups to help us improve people's experiences and aid their Recovery.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "My elderly mum who had dementia was admitted to hospital following a fall in her bedroom at the care home where she had lived for only 6 months. \nShe was taken to hospital in an ambulance at approximately midday and taken into A/E at her local hospital. \nShe was started on treatment which I presume was IV antibiotics and fluids and was also given an injection to help her breathing which was supported with oxygen therapy. \nI was not with her as I was out of the country but my sister was and she tells me that she expected mum to settle overnight and be transferred to a ward the following morning. The staff asked my sister if she needed to let anyone else know mum was in hospital and she said no because it was late in the evening and she did not want to disturb any of the other family particularly as she believed mum would improve. \nMum died after only 12 hours in hospital and neither my sister nor the rest of us were alerted to the fact that she was actually being treated as end of life.\nFrom what seemed an insignificant event of a fall with no apparent injury, she very quickly deteriorated and died in an acute setting at the age of 92 without those who loved her being there. \nThis has been a deeply upsetting event as we feel we were totally unprepared for mum's death and were not involved in any decision making at the end of her life. \nI feel communication was poor and that professionals did not explain what they were doing for mum to the family with clarity and compassion.", "Was diagnosed with Haemorrhoids by my doctor who sent me to see a consultant at southend hospital in June last year. Was told by the consultant I needed a operation as I had bad Haemorrhoids. I under went the operation in November early December. \n\nWithin a few days I developed a blockage was readmitted 2 days before new years day they unblocked me and I was told I needed to see a other consultant but before I could see him I needed a transit study off the bowl done so I was given a appointment to have it done in February 2011. Then had to wait 3 months for the results. In May 2011 I saw a consultant who I was told was a bowl surgeon I saw them in May and they just tried me on 1 dose off meds for 4 weeks then after the 4 weeks I returned to see them and they told me as that 1 dose off meds didn't work I'd need a operation on my bowl.\n\n I thought this person was a bowl surgeon but they were a general surgeon. Anyway they promised me that the operation was to remove a small section off my bowl and I'd be wearing a colostomy bag for 3 months then they would get me back in after 3 months and reverse my bowl back to how it used to be and it would be 3 months again before I would be alright and back to normal. \n\nWell what a laugh I had as they removed my entire large bowl and left me with just my small bowl and nothing else. They removed all my bowl and has not done the reversal at all and left me with the bag for life and now I've lost nearly half my weight I'm down to 8 stone. Now I wear a bag for life I believe this is because the job wasn't done right.

I was incredibly pleased that the doctor at this practice had shown great empathy and was pro active in referring me for an assessment to see what help could be offered.\nIn the meantime, whilst I was waiting for my referral to come through, I began to experience a breakdown and very strong suicidal feelings.\nIn mid May after being attacked and having my phone stolen I found myself unable to function, lost in central London and can only describe the state that I was in as \u2018broken'. With the advice of a family member over a long distance phone call I attended Whipps Cross Accident &Emergency department. On entering, I was surrounded by a number of patients and an incredibly open plan. First contact was with the reception area where I felt unable to report my feelings. I was very aware that there were a number of staff and patients listening to everyone reporting into reception and that there was little scope for privacy and confidentiality.\nFrustrated by this, I left the department.\nI returned home feeling even more hopeless and called the emergency mental health team to where I was waiting for my referral. I spoke to a nurse and explained the situation. They advised me that they would make contact with the mental health nurses at Whipps Cross Hospital and would give me a call back with further instructions. They called back to say that they'd spoken to a nurse who would be expecting me at Whipps Cross Hospital after I had registered with reception and that I would be seen urgently.\nI made my way back to Whipps Cross Hospital.\n\nThe Complaint:\nMy first contact at the reception desk was with a member of staff who seemed to me completely disinterested in communicating positively with any patients. Sitting next to this member of staff was a nurse who looked bored and seemed to just be listening in to everything that they could. When I explained my problem briefly, with no privacy, they showed little interest or empathy. They took my personal details, gave me a red card and told me to queue up at the next set of desks.\nI queued for a further 10 minutes where I was seen by a seemingly disinterested receptionist who went through my details on a computer screen. I explained that a mental health nurse had been contacted and that they were expecting me. The receptionist sent me to a waiting room further down the corridor.\nI was sitting in this waiting room for approximately an hour before I was called into a side room by a nurse. They didn't say a word to me. They proceeded to put a blood pressure pad onto my arm. They still didn't say a word. They then started to look at the veins on my arms. I had not given they permission to touch me and they had not explained anything that they were doing. Angrily I asked what they were doing. The nurse replied that they needed to take some blood. I asked why and they said, \u2018It's just standard procedure. ' I told they that I didn't want any blood taken and that I was here to see the mental health nurse as had been organised via the telephone. I explained that I didn't need blood taken as my condition was not physical. They walked over to their telephone and said that they needed to make a phone call.\nWhilst on the telephone another nurse came into the room. They did not introduce themselves, did not acknowledge me and they sat down on another chair in the room, chewing gum and started talking to another nurse about their personal life. They exchanged comments in a joking manner. Frustrated, angry and confused I put my hood over my head to try and hide away from the situation.\nThe original nurse put the telephone down and said that they couldn't reach anybody. They told me to wait back out in the waiting room.\nI was in this waiting room for approximately four hours whilst people came and went. The nurse continually walked past me and made no attempt to update me on what was happening. When I am in good health I would usually question situations like these but in this \u2018broken' state I sat, waited, drifted in and out of sleep and became more and more hopeless in feeling that I was never going to get anyone to help me.\nApproximately six hours since I had come into the department for the second time I was called into the Accident & Emergency cubicle area. I was lead to a cubicle and chose to sit in a chair. I was unable to make eye contact with anyone and sat with my hood over my head. I was aware of the commotion here and the many patients being seen to. This environment made my symptoms worsen and I was finding it hard to think clearly. I wanted to close the cubicle curtain but in my despair I was afraid and unable to leave the chair that I was sitting in.\nAfter about thirty minutes a nurse of came into the cubicle and closed the curtain. They told me they needed to take my blood. I asked why and they responded the same way as the previous nurse. It was standard practice for anyone coming into the department. I agreed and they began the procedure. They then looked at my notes and in a trivial manner confirmed that I was feeling depressed. I didn't feel confident or capable of going into any further detail with them and just agreed.\nThey then asked my age and said, \u2018A young man of your age, you shouldn't be depressed! Life is hard for everyone; we've all been a bit depressed. My best advice to you is to go home and get a few bottles and drink your troubles away, it works. '\nThis comment turned my stomach, I asked them to leave the cubicle immediately.\nThirty minutes later another nurse came into the cubicle and looked at my notes. They did not acknowledge me at all, they left the cubicle without a word.\nTen minutes later another nurse came into the cubicle and told me that I was being taken to a ward with no explanation as to why. As we left the cubicle a doctor shouted for us to wait one minute. I went back into the cubicle and the doctor came in a few minutes later. This was the first person in the department in over seven hours to show me any empathy or consideration. In the brief conversation that we had this doctor acknowledged that I was feeling incredibly low and explained that I was going to be taken to a ward to wait for the Crisis Team to be called in to assess me.\nI left the cubicle and was taken onto a ward where I laid on a bed feeling incredibly exhausted and hopeless.\nApproximately two hours later I was assessed by a doctor and a nurse from the Waltham Forest Crisis Team. It was agreed that I would attend the Larkswood Centre the following morning at 10am and would be put under the care of the Home treatment Team. I walked home from the hospital in the middle of the night, alone, totally exhausted and feeling hopeless about the future.\n\nSubsequent to the complaint:\nI have since left London after three suicide attempts requiring attention in Accident & Emergency departments, two of these being at Whipps Cross Hospital in July 2012.\nI have also had two inpatient admissions into mental health assessment hospitals and have been diagnosed with \u2018Borderline personality Disorder' and severe depression after initially suspecting a diagnosis of and treatment for \u2018Bi Polar Disorder'.\nI am absolutely disgusted in the way I was spoken to, some of the comments made and the way I was dealt with by the \u2018professionals' working in the Accident and Emergency Department. I am incredibly unhappy with the processes and the time it took to get me, as a very vulnerable person in a state of crisis, seen by the correctly qualified person. I am disappointed that the stigma surrounding mental health is very clearly still a problem in Whipps Cross University Hospital.", "My mum died because of what I believe to be multiple negligence.\nI was with her in hospital daily for 5 months after a car accident, in which she broke both knees and a hip.

Nonetheless she was discharged home and abandoned, to be readmitted 10 days before her death with delirium and raging fever.\nThey had told her she needed to eat more egg whites because her liver function was poor!

Deputy Director of Patient Services", "My husband had Alzheimers since 2009 and where as some people have it for years he went very quickly and from the start it seemed to affect his general health. He was in a residential from September 2011 and then became very poorly in May 2012 and I then fought for CHC and got him into a really good nursing home.\n\nHe developed shingles at the beginning of August. A GP was called he was given antiviral drugs but by the Tuesday his condition was a lot worse and a GP was called. They advised that he needed hospital treatment as he was unable to swallow so there was no medication fluids or pain relieve going into him. I agreed on the understanding that he would be admitted to ST Cross in Rugby as I do not drive and have to rely on public transport. \n\nAmbulance came at 6. 30pm and went to St Cross where they said no doctors would admit to having agreed to take him. That was the start of a 12 days from hell. They needed to get a line into him to take bloods and a nurse and doctor came. The nurse grabbed his right arm, this is where all the blisters were,  and the doctor proceeded to get the line in. I explained he needed to be told in a gentle and kind manner that they would not harm him. He was so afraid the nurse. Then said he needed to have some intravenous pain relief which was not available on that unit so she did go looking for some. \n\nI was told that he would be transferred to Coventry hospital. Then they said they had found a bed he could stay, then a few minutes later they came back and said no he was going. An ambulance came at 8. 45pm to take us over. When we got to A&E a nurse came and again there was no communication as to what was happening to him. I again told them to reassure him. A doctor came and said lets have a look at the rash. I said he has shingles. They went away. By now it was well past 11. 30pm the doctor came back and grabbed both his legs lifted them and let them drop, my husband cried out he was so unwell.  Only one bag of fluid was set up no more pain relief or antibiotics was started. We were then taken to ward 12 into a side ward I left at 2.00am that night to get a taxi back to Rugby. \n\nWhen I went back in at 11. 30am on the same day the side ward was empty and no one knew where he was he had been taken to ward 21. He was again in a side ward and after some time in the afternoon two doctors came to see him after a lot of shouting and trying to get responses from him I was informed that he was very poorly and that this had now become life threatening, but antibiotics was not started until 10. 00pm on the Wednesday. There was no fluid stand they would hook the bags of antibiotics to a hook on the wall at the back of the bed and fluids and pain relieve I had to give through thickened drinks which were very difficult as he was having problems swallowing and as not very keen on the drinks, they would bring his food by the door which was most days a bit of mash with gravy and yogurt there was never an attempt to liquidise foods he lost almost a stone in the 12 days he was there.\n\n I was there every day between 6 and 7 hours over food times most of the time I was completely ignored. There were some days they would just check him once and some days not at all, the only time the doctor spoke to me after the Wednesday was when they had missed calculated his medication. He should have come out on the Friday and when I asked on the Thursday what time will he be discharged they said no he his not coming out tomorrow and the doctor said it would be unwise to not continue the full course which would finish on the Friday. No update as to how my husband was getting on. Then on the Friday I said what time will he be coming out tomorrow. same thing, they had made a mistake I said no I am not having this you keep moving goal posts. I want to see his doctor and find out what is going on they said all doctors had left being as it was bank holiday after a senior nurse checked it was found the last course of antibiotics could be given on the Saturday. \n\nAmbulance was booked for midday. It never arrived, I was there for over eight hours. He came back to the nursing home on the Sunday.\n\nOne day I found the nurses shouting at him because he was anxious when they tried to change him. He left with bed sores and he was discharged under palliative care (END OF LIFE I WAS NEVER TOLD) the nursing home were wonderful and at least the last few days of his life he had lots of love and care. It was peaceful,  which he should have had in hospital.\n\nI felt very alone there trying to support my husband with no support from them. Also the NHS Website states shingles is not contagious? \n\n I am not finished with this, I have sent a report to PALS and intend to take this as far as possible. This was not the only time my husband had been in hospital. In 2011, when I was still looking after him at home, he was in C&W then transferred to St Cross came home covered in bruises but I never found out why. \n\nThere has to be better treatment for people with dementia who go into hospital. As a relative you are devastated enough when coping with the decline of your loved one to this terrible illness, you need to know they will be loved and looked after if they go into hospital. \n\nI am left a widow at 65 he was a lovely husband and every one says how lovely kind and gentle he was. He deserved better and so did I.\n", "About one month ago it came to my attention that after I and my daughter left his practice, our former GP inserted letters in our NHS records in which he wrote that I am mentally ill, am prone to make \"wild and libellous allegations\" about doctors and that my daughter has inherited the same tendency from me.\nThese letters have interfered with and deprived us of our right to health care for at least 15 years. I, in particular, will not register with any GP who treats me as though my spinal injuries do not exist and that I am mentally ill. In fact I have written evidence that I broke my back and neck in a car accident and because of the GP's errors developed arachnoiditis (an incurable spinal disease), that the GP misdiagnosed my injuries as being whiplash, and that several doctors covered up his errors by manipulating medical evidence and writing medical reports saying - untruthfully - that I had whiplash and was psychologically disturbed. This is clearly a matter for the police.\nI have recently complained to the SHIPs (Southampton and other PCTs) complaints dept at Omega House, Eastleigh. They denied receiving the complaints (despite this being sent Recorded Delivery and a signature obtained) and have refused to accept my and my daughter's complaints for investigation.\nDoes the Omega House SHIPS cluster understand that by refusing to investigate my complaints, they may be seen to be assisting in covering up the irregularities of the various named doctors?", "You will have to excuse me I am quite emotional on this subject, and also speaking to you in sharing my ordeal.\nI just want to tell you a little about my husband, and the treatment he got in this hospital.\nMy husband was diagnosed as suffering from Alzheimer's and was unable to communicate with people; really he was in a world of his own. I looked after my husband for 8 years. I loved him, cared for him, and looked after all of his everyday needs.\nYes, I got some help after some time, through going through meetings and social services, Age Concern and Citizens Advice. I was able to get free vouchers to help me to get a break.\nAt first I got one hour for 3 days each week, which I was grateful for. However, no sooner had I got out, I was heading back- it was all lock watching, which was quite stressful.\nSome time later on, I received more vouchers of which I then got 3 hours per day, 3 days per week- which was much better. I was then told I could get a Saturday morning, which was lovely- but my vouchers were stopped! I was told I had to start paying for care.\nMy husband used to like to walk. Yet as his condition worsened the walks got shorter and slower, but he was with me and that was all he wanted.\nWe had been married over 50 years and he was always a lovely happy person. My husband's condition deteriorated and he had to be catheterised.\nIn January, he went off his feet. The Doctor was called and from experience as soon as they see a catheter- it is always (an infection) before the urine is even tested. The doctor checked his chest and prescribed antibiotics. Then she said we don't sent urine infections to hospital. But during the night he got worse, and by morning an ambulance had been called.\nWe travelled to Blackburn Royal and on arrival I was informed that my husband had a touch of pneumonia and not a urine infection. At this point, he was admitted to B4 ward. I noticed how well cared for he was on this ward, I visited everyday, sometimes at lunch to help feed him.\nI always looked and read the notes at the end of his bed to see what drinks or food he had consumed. Also to see if he was being turned regularly and given personal care.\nThere was a young student nurse on this ward who took the time to talk to my husband, and just touch his hand, and his face would light up. He was no longer able to walk so I could no longer look after him much to my sadness.\nIt was arranged that a nursing home in Burnley was going to undertake an assessment of my husband's needs, and if he would be accepted for residence at the home in Burnley. To my shock and surprise, he was taken by stretcher to this home and admitted at 9.30 at night. He had not been assessed and the staff were also surprised on his arrival at their home.\nHe was at the home for 6 days then sent back to Blackburn Royal. Then he was on the admission ward until a bed could be found on the medical ward. Later that afternoon he was taken to D3 Ward.\nI went to visit my husband, and the Admission Ward had not sent any of his clothes and belongings up to the ward, so I went down myself to get them, I was surprised to see a man already in the bed but thankfully he hadn't gone in the locker.\nIt was no wonder I was getting stressed and upset, at this stage on my arrival back on D3 ward my husband was put on a 6 bed ward, put in the far corner, curtains around him and the door closed.\nHe was in someone else's pyjamas, unshaven, and had a terrible mouth. He had his own teeth, but his lips were stuck to his teeth, and his tongue was red and sore and badly cracked. At this stage I was horrified! I asked for mouth sponges and I cleaned his mouth the best I could, but it needed doing more often.\nA couple of days later, I went to see my husband at 2.00 pm. I noticed the drip he was attached to had been leaking. His bed and pyjamas were soaking wet, along with the sheet of which had now gone very cold. The fluid only comes out a \u2018drip at a time'- how long had he been wet and in this state?\nThe machine was also bleeping lots but with the ward door closed it couldn't be heard.\nImmediately I called the nurse she replied \u201cthe doctor needs to put it back in\u201d then another nurse came in to the turn the bleeping machine off. I then said again \u201cMy husband was very wet and cold.\u201d\nWhilst I waited thinking the staff might be coming straight back to change the bed, I realised he had not been shaved again. So I asked the visitor in the next bed if she would mind me making a noise with the electric razor. I shaved him and whilst still waiting I cleaned his mouth again. I rolled the top sheet up a little to take away some of the wetness from the top of his body- whilst still waiting!\nIt was now 1 \u00bc hours since telling the nurse about the drip leakage. I looked at his wrist band and noticed it was in someone else's name. I was so disgusted at seeing this I just broke down, and possibly shouted as well.\nI must have because nurses seemed to be all around me and must have heard me in such a stressful state- even with the door closed. I was so mad and angry, but to put the finishing touches to it- the nurse in her way dismissed it say \u201cwe don't go off that, we go off the notes\u201d. I responded telling her that it was load of rubbish, and it was very important. I said if he had died he would have gone to the Mortuary as this other person, because the notes would have stayed on the ward.\nLooking up at the bed head, they had spelt our name wrong, and the nurse replied it was her scrawl, but that was never put right. Now things were moving. After my tears- a student nurse came to take the drip down, she had gloves on so I realised she couldn't feel the wet sheets, but by now you could see a water mark drying on the sheet.\nThe nurse started to cover up my husband with rolled up sheet. I responded by saying \u201cit's like that because it's wet\u201d, she responded by saying \u201coh yes\u201d then she just went away- maybe it's not her job?\nI had to leave at 3.50 pm to catch my bus that was almost 2 hours since being told. It could have been another 2 hours after I left. Nobody could be bothered.\nThe ward where he was, in all honesty, my feelings are- that he was put in a far corner to die!\nMy husband was quiet and needs not a lot. He has his drip up. I am sure he was left to himself. He was never shaved, never washed and never had his hair combed. And I know for a fact his pyjamas were not changed because I had marked under the collar. He must have been so uncomfortable.\nThe doctor then rang me at home and I knew he was very poorly, and with my consent the drip was taken down. At this stage I was told he would be made comfortable and die in his sleep. The day after, he was sick bringing up yellow bile. I went to inform the nurse and she came right away.\nI had to assist her to move him onto his side. She then wiped his face and left. One hour later I had to go again and find a nurse. I said \u201cI know my husband is dying, but he does need changing from all this sick!\u201d 2 nurses came. They never spoke, never sponged him down. They just put a gown over the top of him instead of his pyjamas. Maybe this was easier for them!\nThe next day my husband died under your care. Did I just say care? There must be another word for it. I know exactly what it is. It's neglect.\nIt would have taken so little for someone just to sit in a moment with the dying, just to say a few words, just to touch their hand, and give them a little reassurance that you care.\nYou talk about \u2018end of life care'. In my eyes, a dying person should always look neat, clean and comfortable, which then in turn will give comfort and acceptance to family and relatives in their final moments. I didn't get that, maybe this is why I cannot get this matter out of my head.\nI hope this story has made some of you emotional as it has me and maybe some of you act- as it is factual. I just hope and pray I never have to be a patient in this hospital after this experience.\n", "I am still detained in Guild Lodge. I have been here for over a year from the very start of my detention. I asked how long I would be here for (more or less). I feel I have never had a straight answer to this question. I don't think I have put a foot wrong since I came, I have engaged with staff and attended a full activities programme, and I am still on a medium secure unit with no plans to release me - at the moment, I should have been told 'at least 18 months to 2 years', but instead there has been no reference to any time scale. This is cruel and I believe it is undignified and against my human rights. I consider myself to be mentally stable, but am frustrated as there is no apparent end to this nightmare. I still have had no clear care pathway designated apart from a referral to a low secure unit which again, I have not time-scale for. \nI was sent here on a mental health section against my will and have never once considered that my illness is of a nature or degree that warrants continued detention.", "Firstly, I am very sorry you do not feel satisfied with your care and treatment within our in- patient unit Guild Lodge, and that you are understandably frustrated with the lack of certainty around your discharge arrangements. Despite your distress, it is commendable that you have engaged in all aspects of your treatment.\r\nUnfortunately the anonymous nature of this forum, to protect confidentiality, limits the scope of my response but I welcome this opportunity to address your queries, and would welcome any further discussion if you feel able on a more individual level.\r\nYou have referred to being detained in Guild Lodge for longer than twelve months. This is a long period for anyone to stay compulsorily in a psychiatric hospital. Unfortunately the length of detention is never fixed at the outset. The decision to discharge anyone from detention is guided by the clinical progress made and any future risks to self or others. Although it could be extremely frustrating for the individual, one cannot predict at the time of admission as to how long it could take for anyone to be ready for discharge.\r\nDetention in a psychiatric hospital under the Mental Health Act 1983 is distinct from a determinate prison sentence which stipulates the date of release from prison. A determinate prison sentence has a punitive element \u2013 it is intended to punish the defendant for the offences convicted. On the other hand, detention in a psychiatric hospital has a therapeutic purpose, to support and care for the person on the road to recovery. The law provides that a person should be detained for treatment as long as it is clinically necessary, ensuring that individuals receive appropriate care and treatment for the necessary length of time. It therefore is not always possible to give a precise time scale for discharge from a psychiatric hospital. If an established set length of time was committed to initially this may hinder recovery and undermine treatment goals by colluding with idea of time \u2018served' rather than time used for appropriate treatment. Your detention is reviewed regularly to ensure that it is necessary and the only option available to meet your mental health needs and manage your risks. The Trust always endeavours to treat anyone using the least restrictive option.\r\nThe Act contains provisions aimed at protecting your rights and liberties. Within Guild Lodge you have full access to this process supported by free legal advice if required. The Trust encourages all the individuals admitted to Guild Lodge to actively participate in their treatment and recovery. We have adopted the \u2018My shared Pathway' recently to improve the communication between the clinical teams and the service users, empowering individuals to take responsibility for their own progress. It allows, and actively encourages service users to negotiate outcomes during their recovery.\r\nAt Guild Lodge we have a number of mechanisms to promote participation of the detained service users in their treatment and progress. Service users and their families are given relevant information about Guild Lodge as soon as they are admitted. Ward Rounds (also known as Patient Care Team Meetings \u2013 PCTMs) and Care Programme Approach Meetings (CPAs) are held regularly to review clinical progress. We encourage active participation of all service users in these meetings. We also encourage the clinical teams to share the necessary reports and minutes of the meetings with the detained individuals (as appropriate). Active engagement in therapeutic activates greatly enables the clinical team to monitor progress of an individual.\r\nWhen a clinical team concludes that the individual could manage in conditions of lesser security, a referral is made to that part of the service. Sometime there is a waiting list for availability of a place as the resources within the Guild Lodge are limited. The clinical teams regularly monitor such transfers to minimise any delays and make every effort to prevent delays in transferring of service users to less secure areas.\r\nIndividually service users who have concerns about any specific aspects of their treatment can raise this in a number of different ways, by contacting the advocacy service (which is independent to the trust), writing to the ward manager or the Responsible Clinician, contacting the solicitor, or by writing to the Customer Care Department of the Trust.\r\nWe also have a number of service user forums and events where we actively listen to service user feedback. This forum include service user champion meeting which is held once month and a champion business meeting that is held on a weekly basis. If you feel you would like to discuss any aspect of your care and treatment with me directly, please contact me at Guild Lodge on 01772 406637.\r\nThank you\r\nSusan Tighe\r\nDeputy Network Director\r\nSpecialist Services\r\nGuild Lodge", "Lincolnshire Community Health Services NHS Trust, as providers of some services at County Hospital Louth, would like to add our sincere condolences and apologies to those of United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust on the loss of your mother and the distress suffered by both of you.\r\nWe work in partnership with our colleagues at the hospital.

He was thankfully stopped and spent the night at Darent Valley hospital. When he was there he was placed under the local crisis team at Dartford and given a months worth of medication.\nFast forward to now my brother is no longer medicated due to him, the crisis team and every other team letting him down in my opinion. He has been passed from each team with promises of help but we're yet to actually receive any useful help. In these few months he's seen them all of 3 times. When he saw the staff they made promises to see him the next week or to call him but they never arrived or called. There have been times he has walked to the centre in the rain and the staff member had gone home without even cancelling the appointment.\nIt's not right to treat someone that way especially not a young man who's very low and also has additional needs. I've had my brother on the phone crying many times as in his words 'The team has ditched me, they don't care' . They made promises of helping him with housing, psychologists to see him but nothing has happened. I have called them, along with other family members, begging for help when he has been suicidal just to be told they can do nothing if he wont talk on the phone.\nI rang the outreach team a few weeks ago, they refused to tell me what is going on but promised they would ring my brother, guess what, still no phone call.\nMy brother is homeless, depressed with an unpredictable mood which is making life hard for everyone. My nan is likely to end up homeless too as she is having to care for him although she's ill herself and barely able to care for herself due to disabilities.", "We are sorry to hear you do not feel your brother is getting the care he needs right now.

He looked rough, sweats, trouble breathing etc. We called our GP who visited him at 2:30 on a Monday to be told the pneumonia was still there as they heard a little crackle on his right lung. They gave him more antibiotics and said if you get worse go to hospital. \nTwo hours later we found him dead in the living room. The post mortem showed severe pneumonia with pus on his lungs. How did the doctor not see this and why did the hospital discharge him after 2 days, and a follow up was not done sooner?\nOur family are in shock, as my brother had no other major health issues.

In April 2011 she fell and broke her hip. She was admitted to the Royal Oldham Hospital where she had an operation to pin the broken hip the next day. Unfortunately the surgeon had delegated responsibility to his registrar who had pinned the hip incorrectly. The operation had to be repeated by the surgeon. Whilst operating, the surgeon decided that a full hip replacement was the best option. \nUnfortunately, this was not the end of it. The new hip became infected, which resulted in mum being drip fed antibiotics for 6 weeks whilst remaining bed-ridden. As you can imagine anyone with Alzheimer's has no idea what is happening to them and mum's mental state deteriorated rapidly. \nShe also had a fall on the ward and broke her wrist. I asked if there was a dementia ward and the answer was 'no and they cannot be watched all the time'. She fell again and broke her other hip, which was pinned. \nAll in all she was there for around 6 months of hell. On release, she is now mostly wheelchair bound, needs constant care in every aspect with mostly no knowledge of where she is, who she is, who we are etc. She is now back there again with infection and most of the staff seem no better. Her mental state is worse and she lashes out. Most of the staff appear to have no idea how do deal with dementia. Often they don't know what medication she is taking, although we have told them. Nurses they almost always say \"I've only just come on duty so I don't know\".\nWe have offered to go to help at mealtimes and with medication but they don't want it. They don't know her history at the hospital, which I find bizarre. Are records not kept on a database that they can look up? \nAnyone with relatives who have dementia and need to go in the ROH - keep a close eye on what is happening.", " There has been much comment both in the paper and on television about the Liverpool Pathway, especially so since a number of patients have recovered after intervention by relatives despite hospital staff being against it. I had never heard of this until my niece mentioned about end of life protocol as my mother lay gravely ill in hospital. As you will see, like the media says, the Protocol was not followed. I was never informed what they were doing, why or when. The hospital doctors did what they did without consulting anyone.\n\nA nurse in charge was particularly unhelpful to say the least as was one ambulance driver. Instead of contacting me as he should, I found it very difficult to see the consultant. What is worse, I now find the hospitals are paid extra for every patient they put on this pathway. Also that in some hospitals the death rate is much reduced following them being paid extra to keep patients alive. \"If a cash bonus results in more lives being saved then what that is really saying is that normally the hospital allows people to die when they could be saved. The money does not directly affect the care, it only affects the mind-set of the people providing the care. They COULD save more lives, but they really can't be bothered without additional money as motivation.\"  This is from the Daily Mail Online.\n\n I am told I am not allowed to name names and perhaps the hospital involved but have very little faith in this hospital and some of its staff who failed us all. I and many others will now feel strongly about what may be another national disgrace.\n\nThis is but a mere cut down version of my original opinion.\n\nMum was ill and an out of hours doctor found all to be okay except for a  severe urinary infection, making a prescription. Whilst this was correct it did not have the usual effect so I called NHS Direct and explained position to a nurse, then a senior nurse who advised hospitalisation and an ambulance took her to hospital.\n\nLater that night a doctor rang to ask about medical history and said Mum had pneumonia from listening to the chest and an X-ray. Antibiotics being given. A woman was changing the catheter (odd because it should have been changed the night before when it was blocked). I was told by her to wait in the common room and would be told when they had finished. 25 minutes later no-one came to inform me so I went to the bedside, all finished and the woman was busy elsewhere. I asked her if he could see the nurse in charge to find out how things were. She repeated the question and went off. No-one came after 15 minutes. I asked again at the desk and was told someone would see me. Eventually the same woman came and asked if I wanted to ask about mum. Apparently she was a nurse. She certainly didn't act like one and her attitude to a few simple questions about my extremely ill mother were not compatible with her job. Mum was on a saline drip but only a quick attempt with an NG tube to administer liquid nutrients was made and abandoned. Mum also had an oxygen mask.\n\nA doctor rang to point out further complications and said further decisions would be made after the weekend. In my opinion, it is now a well known fact to all who read the papers that at weekends there is a lack of more experienced doctors available and that the death rate of patients goes up as a consequence.\n\n Mum did not respond to the antibiotics and I was informed she may not live very long. On the Monday morning I found the drip and drugs had been removed but could get no reason why from the staff. I asked repeatedly to see the consultant and after some hours he saw me for the first time. He showed me a scan and said there was hope and that mum was in a vegetative. He said giving further antibiotics for the infection would not in effect help the brain and reattaching the saline drip would if anything only increase pressure on the brain. In his view the best thing was to leave things as they were and let nature take it's course. Death would come within hours or a few days at most. \n\nIf all had been done properly and explained beforehand I would not have felt so bad. They should not have initiated the Liverpool Pathway without my permission.\n\nWhen later that day they even removed the oxygen mask I asked for mum to go home with me. Some hours later this came about. I had to write a dictated letter and sign it first. I will say one of the ambulance men was very sympathetic but his partner was to put it mildly extremely unhelpful. I could say much more!\n\n Mum died 4 hours later in her bed as she would have wanted whilst the district nurses were in attendance. I saw her draw her last breath, a moving experience. Mum would have been happy knowing she died at home in the care of one she loved and held on long enough for this to happen. \n\n I believe mum was in a dire situation and would have died anyway but the way she was treated and the failure to notify me beforehand regarding the Liverpool pathway was disgusting. It is a time when relatives need as much information as possible so that they and only they can make the choice whether to proceed. I feel sure countless others have had bad experience with this so called Liverpool Pathway and the way it is administered. I see reports that some patients have actually recovered with help from loving relatives despite reproval from attending medical staff.\n\n\n", " The Queen Elizabeth in Gateshead placed my grandmother (Nana) on the liverpool care pathway (LCP) without informing my Grandma, or any of us, her family. We would have removed her, if we had known what was planned by the staff of this hospital. On several occasions, my Gran, was ready to be discharged then contracted more bugs from this hospital.\n\nWhile Gran was in this hospital she contracted MRSA super bug. My Gran was a fighter, and recovered from this hospital super bug. Soon after, she contracted E. coli and Klebsiella.\n\nNana was in and out of hospital from October until her life ended April of this year.\nThe catalogue of events that unfolded in this time period, were nothing short of disgusting in my view. She had been admitted to wards that were filthy, Her bed, was beside the bins, on many of her earlier admittances. On one particular occasion the floor was stained and filthy under one of the bins, it was similar to a dirty bus shelter. I reported this to the staff and they cleaned it. It was still very dirty and they said it was rust marks from the bins. I touched the floor, and the dirt was still coming off on my fingers.\n\nOne particular occasion she was given a sleeping pill, and allowed to go to the toilet by herself, Gran fell asleep on the toilet and fell off the toilet and on to the floor and bruised her head and face and neck so badly, she looked like a car crash victim. We still have pics of this on our phones. In fact the bruising and swelling was so severe, she still had bruises from this, at the time when she died. Other patients visitors thought she was in hospital for those injuries, because they looked so horrific. People kept approaching her asking her how she received her injuries.\n\nThe final admittance was by far the worst.\n\nMy Grandma's was addmitted into hospital with a broken hip in early February. She fell at home. After the operation medical staff removed the stitches and the wound reopened and became infected. She had to go for another operation to have the wound washed out and reclosed. This was apparently dangerous, yet she pulled through this too.\n\nI am her Granddaughter. The horror commenced, the head nurse informed us that my Gran had gases in her stomach, that would be naturally absorbed into her body, nothing to worry about. The very next day we were told she was dying, and would be dead soon, this came as a great shock, as we had just been told she was fine. I felt that the staff were blunt and without feeling, they just dropped the 'bomb shell' without a meeting or discussion of any kind. 'The new out of the blue diagnosis they disclosed to us was Gran had poison leaking into her stomach from her bowels. There was a slim chance this would close and repair itself. My grandmother said she was not in pain, and she had no fever, and seemed fine. The hospital staff seemed to  starve and dehydrate her for days, and moved her table out of her reach. She even commented to me, about this, saying 'look they have moved my table, so I cant reach it, its like I don't need it any more'. The hospital did not tell any of us, they were putting her on the LCP They told us, they were keeping her comfortable this was we felt very sneaky, it appears 'keeping comfortable is the title of Liverpool care pathway. Well it certainly is, if you don't want the patients family to know. We were led by the hospital to believe she was dying naturally, and they were keeping her comfortable with morphine and other drugs. The hospital staff certainly did not tell us it was the LCP. At that moment in time, none of us had heard of LCP and did not know it even existed, until I heard a doctor mention it, like it was a paracetamol or something of no real interest.\n\nThe hospital started by giving my beloved Grandma injections of morphine in the hand, and a lot of pills with no more than a mouthful of water to swallow them. Gran said to the nurse I need more water to swallow those pills', and the nurse give her a tiny bit more, and said she shouldn't be doing this. The nurse said I am not supposed to give her more water. Grandma was tired, but was still conscious at this stage. she was given no food and no drinks. My gran could talk to us, at this stage, she forced herself awake to talk to us, her visiting close family. The next day Gran was given further injections too, and was not allowed food or water for two days. The next morning my youngest daughter and her friend visited my Gran, they found her sleepy from the drugs and lethargic due to lack of nourishment and hydration. I visted in the afternoon with my eldest daughter. We arrived just as my youngest daughter was leaving. To my horror when I got there, she was so heavily sedated she was unaware that we were there, with her. My Gran appeared semi comotozed from drugs from the syringe driver. That was not her, at all. The hospital did not ring or inform any of us, they just went ahead and started the morphine driver while we were not there, with her. It seemed to me, it was done, so it was under way before we arrived. The whole time I was unaware what it was. If she could have woken she most certainly would have. I was so concerned, and went and asked to speak to a doctor. A doctor came down as I said I was concerned about her breathing. I asked them why they had stopped all her crucial medication, heart pills etc. They said she did not need them. I asked the staff to feed her, or at least, give her fluid and antibiotics. They refused without an explanation. I knew this was not right. How could she possibly have a fighting chance, without her life saving drugs and fluids. Every living thing needs fluids, and when a person is sick, they usually need more fluids.\n\nThe hospital had linked her up to a syringe driver and it felt like they left her there to rot. They popped in to see her only several times in a 14 hour period. This was to move her. moving my Grandma caused her to be anxious, and she started shouting groaning. I called my family to come to her bed side, as I knew she looked very poorly at this stage. The hospital did not provide oral care or anything, that would be of benefit to her well being. We requested the mouth care, as it was common sense that she needed this, as her lips were sticking to her gums, and she kept sticking her tongue out, as it appeared she was desperate for water. It felt like no one monitored her health, or checked if she was improving. Nana eventually received mouth care only when we requested it for her. She would not have got this, if we had not asked for this for her. It was very distressing, Gran could not talk, and did not know we were there. She pulled herself up several times and shouted 'help'! and home! It was as if she was asking us to take her home? We just sat there powerless, as the staff assured us, she was fine, and none of us new the full extent of what was happening to her. We sat from 1. 45pm until she sadly passed away at 3. 55am early the next morning.\n\n \n\n", "My relative underwent private surgery under care of York Suite.\n\nI have submitted complaint to health professional council over a radiographer at the BRI who I believe was abusive and slanderous towards my relative. The hpc had to tell me who this staff member was as the hospital refused to tell me. One reason they said it was too difficult for them to find out who it was as they have so many staff. Second reason was they were obliged not to reveal such information. I work in the NHS myself and found the staff to be talking utter rubbish in order to fob me off.\n\nIt appears staff may have nearly overdosed my relative with meds on one evening on another evening I understand they missed them off the meds ward round completely.\n\nA porter there was angry with staff as they made him take my relative down to X-ray in a wheelchair. The radiographer down in X-ray said staff should have taken my relative to X-ray on their bed and not forced them into a wheelchair. This radiographer urged my relative to submit a complaint. The pain my relative experienced had them in tears. They were in tears every single day of their stay at this hospital.\n\nOn one evening, staff had my relative up until 3am in agony as two members of staff struggled for 45 minutes to insert a catheter.\n\nAt the end of the stay and numerous complaints I submitted, staff were surprised to find out that my relative had paid for the treatment and they didn't even know they were private.\n\nThe day after surgery my relative found a small tube still inserted in them from surgery which should have been removed.\n\nThe room they stayed in was never cleaned properly in the week my relative stayed there. I washed my relative down when I visited twice a day, and the bed sheets which appeared to be blood stained from surgery weren't even changed until the 3rd day. \n\nIt is now 3 weeks since the initial complaint and I am still awaiting a response from the hospital. I very much doubt they will issue an apology.\nAbsolutely disgusting treatment and attitudes - would not recommend for anyone. If this is how private patients are treated, god help NHS patients.\n\n", "My mum is currently in the Glenfield hospital, Leicester. She is too scared to comment about the care that herself and others on her ward are receiving, which she feels is disgraceful. \nI have witnessed some of the attitudes of some of the nurses who I feel sadly bring down the name of nurses who do care. I have been consoling my mum for the past three days and have well and truly had enough but cannot do anything as I fear she will be treated even worse. Things like:\n- her cannula popping out of her arm and being left for four hours, as the nurse reported being too busy\n- painkillers prescribed first thing in the morning by the Dr, yet waiting ten hours because again they are too busy\n- being given insulin when she is not supposed to have it\n- not getting her diabetes injection all day as there simply isn't time, then getting told she can't leave because sugars and blood is unable to stabilise\n- being told off as mum asked for breathing apparatus, then it being plugging in high above her - forcing mum to ask for assistance. At this point the nurse stretched the wire whilst mum had to manoeuvre herself in a contorted manner, then the whole thing blew up in her face. The nurse laughed and walked off. \n\nDisabled and elderly with compounding health concerns - no wonder she cries on the phone to me at night. I have witnessed this treatment with others on the ward also - help these poor OAP's to have dignity, to be listened to.", "Both Basildon Hospital A&E and the Fracture Clinic missed that I had broken my foot in 5 places and also my arm. The Triage Nurse said it wasn't necessary to X-ray my arm as she thought it seemed OK. I was sent home with no treatment. \n\nThe Fracture clinic eventually put my arm in plaster about 2 weeks later but did nothing about my foot which was even worse by this point. As there was no improvement and out of sheer desperation, I then had a private CT scan which confirmed the extent of the breaks. I ended up with both my arm & foot in plaster casts for weeks. \n\nOverall I experienced a terrible service and I would rather travel to a different hospital if I had an emergency now.", "Earlier this year, my sister was admitted to an Ward 5 with a stroke and she was not given a clot buster as part of her treatment.  Approx 3 weeks later, the relatives were offered the opportunity to remove all her treatments including hydration and nutrition. At this stage, they refused the offer. She was not offered speech therapy nor physiotherapy - not even for her affected arm which was becoming very contracted. In late May, a progress meeting was held where it was decided, in my view illegally, that her treatment should be stopped. However, because I queried the legality of this, they checked the Mental Capacity Act and found that it was illegal. In spite of this, the consultant said they would not give her any antibiotics, should she need them. I wrote to the medical director, the chief executive and the consultant requesting a meeting, which they ignored. \n\nInstead soon after, they transferred her to a local Nursing Home where, in my opinion, she was illegally put on the Liverpool Care Pathway. She was not dying and the relatives were not informed until after she was put on the LCP - we were not informed until after she died 15 days later. I feel we were lied to and deceived by the nurses and the medical staff and especially by the doctor I spoke to after my sister's death. I believe she tried to fudge the course of events and muddy the waters by eternally quoting the importance of her \"professional Judgement\". \n\nI am finding it incredibly difficult to come to terms with the loss of my sister but importantly that she died alone, because we were not told that she was put on the LCP. I believe the senior staff at the hospital and all the people who I feel deliberately deceived us at the Nursing Home should be ashamed of their lack of professionalism.  \n\nMy sister was in Airedale Hospital for almost 4 months. She did not have her nails cut and they were long and thick. When I asked if it was possible to cut her nails, I was told by a care assistant that they had to go on a course to learn how to cut nails and anyway they didn't have time. When I next visited her nails were cut but only on one hand and not her toe nails. Her mouth was in a disgraceful state with huge white spots, I wondered whether this was thrush.   I cleaned her mouth when I could, but it was very sore. On the positive side, some of the nurses were lovely and the ward sister was also very supportive, albeit reticent about my sister's care plan. \n\nIn my opinion, PALS was positively useless, as were most of the agencies who purport to be on the patients side. I did not receive any help or useful advice. It is a shambles. This is a short version of what has been a complete nightmare.", "My mother was admitted with cellulitis (a common skin infection).\nShe went into Blackburn Hospital, caught pneumonia. I was told they would not resucitate her if her heart stopped. They administered morphine, this drug interferes with breathing. I believe my mother died as a result.\nThe doctor, when asked, stated well hospitals are the place to contract infections!\nI have several more serious complaints that I will not bore you with.", "I had my prostrate removed 15 months ago at the Western General Hospital and I am as bad as I was when it was done.\nI am totally incontinent and have been relying on pads all this time. I have attended the Western on the odd occasion when they want to see me but nothing has ever been done.\nThey did apologise to me about 3 months ago, saying I had been neglected and it won't happen again. Well I'm sorry, no contact since, my life is in tatters thanks to you the surgery. They told me I would receive any treatment I required. Well let me tell you I have been ignored since this stupid operation.\nAll I want is my life back, to go out without filling pads, not to mention the smell, and as for my sex life its all gone. They have taken this away from me. My relationship is in serious doubt as I have told the surgeon on several occasions, so my only option is to take my complaint to the GMC.", "Dear Relative\r\nI am most concerned to read about the experiences your Mum and other patients on the ward are receiving.

After some blood tests they decided to keep her in. She was taken to SAU ward where the staff were very good. She has dementia, type 2 diabetes and most recently recovered from a ruptured gallbladder.\nOn the Sunday they decided to move her to Ward C4. At 10.30pm I alerted the nurse to the cannula that had come out unfortunately. So her vital glucose fluids were not going in. The nurse just looked at me with apathy and told me that the Dr had to do that. I assumed she meant perhaps the following morning at the latest? !\nI came back at 3pm on the Monday. I had called in the morning to ask about the cannula and fluids (WHY AM I HAVING TO DO THIS BY THE WAY? ).  I was falsely assured that it would be reinserted when the doctors did their rounds.\nSo 3pm, no one has seen my mum, no one has escalated the cannula being out and bag of fluid just sitting there from 10pm previous night. I ask the nurse why the cannula is still out and was told that the doctors suggested that.

Excellent person indeed. The site manager proceeded to reinsert the cannula and get the fluids going again.\nOn Tuesday the Bag of fluid runs out. No Dr has seen my mum. I am forced to go to PALS to complain. Why should I need to do this? A severely dehydrated, diabetic patient with dementia has not been seen in 48 hrs. Disgusting!\nAs for Aramark, do they know some patients have dementia? When you say do you want breakfast and the patient says no, they just cruise on by with not a care in the world. \nThe CEO has a video out saying care and attention must be given to patients and relatives?  I felt that  no one I saw cared about my mum, no one cared about me either.\nIf I had not intervened, I don't know how long my mum would have been left in that ward. 3-4 days?

Initially, directly after the operation she was able to use her hands to full effect and all the signs were that she would make a good recovery. \nHowever, when my Father and I went to visit the following day we found her slumped in a chair, leant forward with her eyes bulging, red in the face, struggling to breathe. We asked the nurse to get her back in bed and she made a remark about how busy she was. \nWhen they eventually came Mum could not get out of the chair and told them several times that she could not feel her arms and legs. They had to eventually hoist her back in bed. After this, Mum was admitted to critical care and has now been left totally paralysed and doubly incontinent. \nWe have since complained but we feel we have encountered nothing but a smokescreen from the doctor the trainee was working under and their team. \nMum went in for a relatively routine operation because she was losing feeling in her hands and now needs 24 hour care and can only move her head.

The attending registrar was helpful and attempted to arrange for me to be treated privately (I have insurance), but this did not happen, partly as my warfarin needed to be neutralised. I was in pain and heavily sedated when I was asked to sign a consent form for surgery and did so without thinking. I was 86 at the time and in spite of a statement during a complaints meeting with management, after a 6 months delay, by the Director of Orthopaedics at the hospital that my injury was\"complex, significant and of severity\", I was operated on by \"the team\" (no names given when I asked) of registrars without any consultant being present. I feel that this may have been an ageist decision by the person who allocated me. I feel the severity of my injury warranted treatment by an experienced consultant. The outcome is that slippage of the wrist has occurred, mobility to turn the wrist has been greatly reduced, nerve damage was so severe that I needed specialised neurosurgery after a carpal tunnel operation proved fruitless (both privately- not at Nortwick Park Hospital) and am still not fully restored some 14 months after the accident. At the complaints meeting management were not helpful and prevented any input from staff who had treated me in spite of our request for this and our offer to attend at the hospital's convenience.", "My partner went 7 months without treatment, after an alleged allergic reaction to the 3 rd session of a chemotherapy course.

After his death, at a meeting I was informed that the lack of treatment was his own fault as he agreed to everything the Oncologist said. He put his trust in these people, but the fact here was there was no kudos or back slapping 'miracle worker' praise for them as his cancer was not operable and terminal.", "Hello. My mother in law was in her 60s and had smoked for many years despite having asthma and developing emphysemia. She had cut down considerably, smoking e-cigarettes instead in recent months.\nShe was admitted to hospital last month, with pneumonia in one lung, which had mostly cleared in about a week so they sent her back to her care home. The next day she was re-admitted because it had gone to her other lung.\nShe was initially on antibiotics and the strongest oxygen mask that they had, but she refused the mask after 24 hours (because it was painful and she suffered from panic attacks) and chose a less pressured one. They said it didn't look hopeful but that they couldn't give her a sedative to help her keep the strongest mask on because it might \"send her on her way\".\nThe antibiotics were stopped and her fluid drip not replaced. They just gave her palliative care but her lips and mouth were very dry. She hadn't eaten properly in 2 days. Her blood oxygen level showed above 80% but they said that there wasn't anything more that they could do for her.\nMy partner stayed with his mother for 3 days watching her condition degenerate painfully.

I had taken him to A&E on the Saturday and again the following day after he rapidly began to lose his eyesight and could barely walk. \n\nAfter a 6. 5 hour wait, he was finally admitted to MEAU and after a day or two had to be moved to SEAU as his bed was needed (I thought at the time it was a strange ward to be admitted to from what appeared to be serious neurological symptoms). He was then left on the ward totally blind and unable to care for himself (relying on his family to help him with eating, toileting and washing) as the SEAU ward, understandably, is too busy a ward to deal with such care). \n\nWhen the doctors came to do their usual rounds, they missed out my husband. When I asked why he wasn't able to see a doctor, I was told he already had a care plan in place and therefore it wasn't necessary. I knew that my husband needed an urgent MRI scan as we had been told in A&E, but I was constantly fobbed off and told there wasn't any available appointments because of the backlog from the bank holiday. \n\nAfter 4 days and at the point of total blindness, I demanded that we see a neurologist (we still hadn't seen one since my husband was admitted). Eventually, after being treated very rudely by one of the doctors, I was told that we could have a 5 minute appointment in the outpatients department the following day, but it would only be 5 minutes because there were no appointments actually available and I would have to take him to the appointment in a wheelchair. I was really cross, but accepted this as our only chance of getting any medical attention (it really was a very frustrating and a surreal situation, that no one seemed at all bothered by a man who obviously had something seriously wrong). \n\nHowever, on the same day, I made an unbelievable discovery. When I went through my husbands hospital notes (a long story I won't bore you with), it became apparent that my husband was being treated as another patient, who (according to the notes) had asked to be admitted to MEAU for observation after being worried about symptoms they were experiencing relating to a headache). The detailed notes in my husband's file had my husband's name and NHS number on, the care plan also had my husbands name on, which stated that the patient be admitted to MEAU for observation and painkillers. However, when I read them I realised that they related to a she and not to my husband at all. My husband had certainly not self admitted for a headache. \n\nI was absolutely furious. My husband had been left on the ward with observation and painkillers (intended for another patient) and left to go blind, for 5 days. When I brought this to the immediate attention of the staff on the ward, suddenly a neurologist from Sheffield was available and came over to Lincoln to see my husband. He was eventually diagnosed with a serious condition and immediate medication was then started. I do not know what would have happened if I had not taken the time to read my husband's notes, (or not in this case) carefully. No one else had done. No one else had noticed that they did not relate to him.\n\nI am still waiting to hear about my formal complaint from Lincoln City Hospital. PALS said, as they have a big back-log of complaints to deal with, they are unable to give me a time limit as to when this can be investigated. It fills me with little confidence. I seriously worry about the safety of other patients. \n\n9 months and 'those at the top' are still unaware of my complaint.

I have had several surgical procedures due to the disease. My last was in 2009 when I had a permanent ileostomy. I also had a proctectomy. \n\nSome months later my wound had not healed. I complained to the surgeon, who decided to re open the wound and use a vax machine to close it up. This took 4 weeks as an inpatient. \n\nFollowing this, I continued with a open wound, continued feeling ill and continued complaining to the doctor. I was admitted several times and had several scans to be told each time that the scan didn't show anything that was consistent with my pain. I was by this time dependent on morphine and unable to walk. I was bed ridden most days. \n\nI did some research and found a doctor down in London who had experience of Crohns complications. I emailed him and he advised me to contact St Marks for a referral there. In the meantime I was admitted again. This time my surgeon was away, so a different member of his team sent me for a tummy scan. When I came back to the ward, I asked what was shown. I was advised it had shown some fluid pockets. I was also seen by a gynaecologist who told me I had a small ovarian cyst conclusive with that of a menstrual cycle. (I did advise him that I hadn't had any for some time). \n\nOn the return of my own surgeon, he sent me to radiology to have these pockets drained with needles. This was a very invasive procedure which gave me little relief but the strange thing was the radiologist actually said to me 'do you realise how big these pockets were?' He described them as large oranges (several of them). By this time I was not getting any better and had a fraught out patients appointment to see my surgeon. I insisted on a second opinion. He said he would refer me to his friend in Birmingham. He also stated that he had only seen one case like this, so he was unsure on doing surgery. When I asked what had happened to the other person, he said she went and never came back. So he didn't know. He was still pretty sure my pain wasn't conclusive with the scan. After a further admittance for pain, he came to me and said he might send me to Oxford for a second opinion. I agreed. \n\nI went to see the doctor in Oxford, who took one look at my scan and stated he can fix me. I was put on an urgent list and had surgery within weeks. The surgery took seven hours and was a dual surgical procedure with a bowel doctor and a professor of gynaecology. After the surgery, I was advised there were several masses, a chronic infection and I had to have a hysterectomy and a opphorectomy (ovaries removed). The biopsy report showed several masses that needed to be tested for malignancy, All were benign. My fallopian tubes were unrecognisable and the the surgeon stated he was amazed how I had managed with this inside. \n\nIf it had been left to New Cross, I dread to think where I would be today.", "Dear Elsa,\r\nWe at the Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust have great sympathy for the complications that you have experienced from your disease and from the surgery.\r\nWe responded promptly to your complaint through our complaints process and were advised that the Parliamentary Health Service Ombudsman has also reviewed your complaint.

We are pleased you were happy about the outcome of your treatment and we hope you continue to improve.", "My complaints are with regard to a number of issues that came to my attention when my Mum was recently admitted to the Countess of Chester Hospital and eventually died and concern the poor standard of basic care that the staff provided for her in the last week of her life. I hope you could investigate the matters raised.\nMy Mum had been suffering from cervical cancer for four years but was admitted to the hospital in March 2010 and diagnosed with bronchial pneumonia aswell. In the night, 2 days after she was admitted Mum was transferred to Ward 51, in a single bedroom. \nUpon entering the room I noticed it was very cold and the window was open. I shut the window and put my hand on the radiator and realised the radiator was not working. I reported this to the porter who had bought Mum to the room. He in turn told either the ward sister or staff nurse who confirmed there was a problem with the radiator and in turn tried to contact the maintenance department to affect a repair. I was then told that no one from maintenance could attend until the morning and my Mum was given an extra sheet to keep her warm. Do you think this is the correct procedure for an elderly woman who has been diagnosed with bronchial pneumonia? \nThe hospital Trust's response to this complaint is that an \u201caction plan\u201d has now been prepared. Surely an \u201caction plan\u201d does not have to be written for something as basic as this? And if it does it should have been written when the hospital was initially opened and the question needs to be asked, did not the medical staff realise that a cold room is not an appropriate place for an elderly patient with bronchial pneumonia, or is this the first case of bronchial pneumonia that staff at the hospital had dealt with? \nI put it to you that even someone who has no medical knowledge at all would know that this is not good practice and would not need an \u201caction plan\u201d to inform them of such basic care!\nOn the same day I returned to visit my Mum with other members of the family. After we had been there approximately 2 hours I realised that my Mum had not been changed. Bearing in mind that Mum had been suffering from cervical cancer with the associated blood losses for four years and now in the last week of her life was doubly incontinent. I drew this to the attention of a member of staff and was told Mum would be changed \u201cin a minute\u201d. This was a standard reply to almost anything I asked a member of staff during the week my Mum was in hospital. My Mum had to wait a further 4 hours to be changed. The effect that this had was to make her feel uncomfortable and gave her lack of dignity. This was predictable and preventable. The attitude that was portrayed to me from a lot (but not all) of the staff was the staff were trying to run a hospital and could not be inconvenienced with looking after elderly dying patients.\nThe Trust's response to this complaint is that it has produced an \u201caction plan to remind staff of the importance of monitoring and changing patients. \u201d My response to this is, surely an action plan has already been produced to inform staff of how to clean patients or is this first patient they have needed to clean since the hospital opened?\nAlso whilst my Mum was in hospital \u00a320.00 was taken out of her handbag (which was in a zipped holdall) and lost by a member of staff and I was told that the money had been put in a safe for safe keeping but no receipt was ever issued. Mum was also aware that the money had been taken and until she lost consciousness kept asking me to make sure that the money was returned but because Mum was gravely ill this was the last thing on my mind. However when Mum died my daughter asked the nursing staff for the money to be returned. The money however was never located and I made an official complaint but despite a thorough internal investigation, was never found and the member of staff who took it never owned up to this. \nHowever a few months after my mum had died, I received a cheque with a letter of apology from the legal services department. In this instance it is not about the money but the principle of what happened.\nOther instances of this kind of behaviour occurred during my Mum's brief stay in hospital, concerning her tablets not being given in the correct sequence and a barrier cream to alleviate soreness of her cervical tumour (which had been specifically prescribed by my Mum's consultant prior to her admittance). The doctor in charge was also ill informed as to some of my Mum's medication as some of her medication was not even listed on her medical notes which I can only assume is yet another act of poor attention to detail. When I informed the ward doctor I was told this medication was not on her notes and to found out what the missing medication was called myself. Surely this is the job of the doctor! They then told me bluntly, that my Mum would probably be dead by the end of the week! I then had to remind the doctor that this lady that she showed little regard for was my Mother and that she should be treated with a little more respect and dignity. \nEventually after making a number of telephone calls I found the name of the barrier cream myself and informed the doctor who instructed ward staff to apply it. Unfortunately the staff were untrained as how to use this cream or for what it was for and started to apply the cream to dry skin on my Mum's feet and it was only as a result of my Mum informing the staff that it was applied to the cervical tumour.\nI also observed other elderly patients who could not manage to eat or drink for themselves not being fed by the nursing staff and it is my belief that if you cannot feed yourself in hospital you will starve. In the last couple of days of my Mum's life when she could no longer drink properly we noticed that her lips were completely dry due to the fact that the staff were not even moistening them. Fortunately we visited and stayed with her for about 12 hours a day but on our return it was obvious they had not been moistened.\nI had an unbiased opinion of the NHS and this hospital until I witnessed first hand the events I have mentioned in this letter and am now extremely disappointed and concerned with the attitude and care that some of the staff and hospital provide.\nI fully understand that everyone dies and when a close relative dies it is going to be upsetting but the staff showed little or no compassion to the situation and I had to point out to the doctor that it may be a run of the mill situation for her to have a patient die but to me it was the worst thing that could possibly happen and my life would never be the same again. The attitude that came across was why invest time and money on an elderly patient who is terminally ill.\nOn a separate occasion last August I had course to attend the hospital in association with my job. It was on this occasion whilst in the assessment area that I came across another incident of poor care to an elderly patient. For three hours myself and my colleague heard an elderly female patient asking for help desperately from a nurse. \nShe repeated this over and over again. I opened the door of the cubicle where we where and I had clear vision of the cubicle where the elderly female patient was calling for help. During the three hour period I saw a nurse go into the cubicle and tell the elderly patient sternly to be quiet and that she was going to shut the cubicle door as she was disturbing the other patients. The nurse then shut the door on this patient and I heard her say to other member of staff that the patient was annoying her. The other members of staff simply ignored this patient completely. \nIn my opinion all this elderly confused patient wanted was someone to hold her hand for a moment and reassure her everything was alright. Again this is another instance were someone like a nurse who is supposed to be of a caring disposition showed no caring or compassion. I wrote a separate letter of complaint over this matter having made a note of the patient's name and gave a description of the nurse involved.\nI have written to the complaints department of the hospital, the Chief Executive and the Parliamentary Health Service Ombudsman as to my observations and complaints and have asked as to what action has been taken against the staff and requested that disciplinary action be taken against the members of staff that were, in my opinion, negligent, and have written documentary evidence of the replies but I feel that nothing will be done other than for them to apologise for the bad practices that were carried out. \nDespite a request the Trust will not inform me if they have taken any disciplinary action. The bad practice and treatment of the elderly at this hospital that I witnessed (and other hospitals) needs exposing so that members of the public know what to expect when family and friends are admitted to hospital. I have also written to the hospital and asked them under The Freedom of Information Act as to how many complaints they have received regarding the lack of basic care of patients from 1st January 2007 until 23rd June 2010 to which they replied 141. I believe I have only just scratched the surface as to what is going on in this hospital and am now at a loss as to where to turn for assistance in this matter.\nIf you wish to discuss this matter further with me, I would encourage you to contact me.", "I was working at the hospital and it was when I fainted I decided to admit myself to the A&E department. I had a vague idea of what it was that was wrong but wanted a second opinion and diagnosis. It was in the A&E waiting room that my condition took an unfortunate turn and I collapsed for a second time. I was moved to a bed in 'see and treat' or otherwise known as 'minors' as at that point that's where there was a bed for me to lie down. In there, I had no observations taken or anybody come to see if I was OK. Fortunately, my husband is a doctor (in a different department) and came to see me as soon as he could. He was horrified that I was in that room with the curtain closed for 4 hours before anybody came to see me. Even then, that was due to the cleaner telling an SHO I looked in a bit of pain. I'd like to say this was the end of the story but unfortunately it got worse. I was then seen by a Jr Doctor who quickly examined me telling me 'I'd better be quick otherwise we'll breach with you'. Unfortunately, that doctor missed every crucial examination on me and discharged me home very poorly. I then went home and was rushed to hospital (a different one requested by my husband) with septicaemia of Pyelonephritis. I was then on HDU for four days with a questionable kidney transplant.\r\nI am well and recovered now and I cannot thank the staff enough at the second hospital I went too. They were diligent and caring. Unfortunately, in an environment like A&E you are sometimes seen as a 'number' and not a patient. The care is very rushed and as a patient you can feel like you are not being listened too as staff are too concerned with time breaches and bed spaces.\r\nOn the whole, I love the NHS and the work they do but on the odd occasion have felt very let down by poor systems and care in place.\r\nThank you", "Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback on your experience at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham.\r\nWe welcome all feedback and would like to assure you that all comments are taken seriously and acted upon as part of our ongoing commitment to improving patient experience.\r\nWe are very concerned to hear about your experience whilst being treated in our Emergency Department.

He became ill after 2 doses and attended the emergency department at East Surrey Hospital taking his card with details of his treatment. He had difficulties in breathing and severe pain in the chest, throat and back, his blood pressure was raised.\nHe was sent home after 25 minutes with instructions on how to control his panic breathing and to rest, to lower his blood pressure, as they believed he was having a drug reaction. They did not call the number on the card, although it was in the middle of the day to get advice. The doctor saw him for a maximum of 2 minutes.\nHe died one and half hours later at home. The autopsy revealed he had a tear in the aortic arch to his heart, and this had gone unnoticed. \nThe hospital admit they should have looked more closely, but said they were too busy. There were things they could have done and had the correct diagnosis been made earlier they could have performed an emergency operation which may have saved his life. He was 49.\nMy opinion of East Surrey hospital emergency doctors and indeed nurses is poor.", "My nan was taken into hospital after having spital on her chest (she had MND so she couldn't swallow) so this had to be professionally removed to enable her to breath clearer. My nan couldn't speak the only way of making communication was by writing in note pads. \nWe have the note pad which states that she went through neglect, was left in urine for several hours, not been fed at all because none of the nurses were trained to feed through a peg. She explains in the notes that one of the nurses had dropped a monitor on her arm causing a bruise. \nShe then was discharged back home on Thursday night (having never had the spital removed), and on the Friday morning her breathing was worse. We called the dr out who insisted she was admitted into hospital. She refused and wrote I can't go through all that again.\nShe passed away a few hours later.\nI'm after some answers, I have plenty of time on my hands, and feel that hospitals are getting away with this too often.", "Dear Anonymous,\r\nI am truely saddened to read about your experience at Good Hope -please contact me if you would like to discuss the issues you have raised in person.\r\nKind Regards\r\nSue Moore\r\n01214249001", "Dear Laurs\r\nMany thanks for taking the time to post your comment on Patient Opinion and please let me say how very sorry I am to hear about the death of your husband.

I was 19 and collapsed at 4am in agony, throwing up everywhere, and passing out. The paramedics found me on the floor covered in sick and one kept telling me there was nothing wrong with me, that I was being a baby, and that he didn't want to take me to hospital even after I insisted. Then he sat with me in the ambulance for 30 minutes stationary telling me I shouldn't go. \n\nWhen I got to the hospital I was left with no answers, absolutely terrified. Then I heard doctors and nurses outside talking about an Ectopic pregnancy which scared me more but no one would speak to me. An insensitive doctor then came into me and said 'Oh by the way, did you know that you are pregnant? And we think it's Ectopic'. I didn't even know I was pregnant and luckily knew what an Ectopic pregnancy was because no one explained it to me. While I was still in shock he left again without waiting for an answer. \n\nBriefly I will explain what happened in the next few days; I had to wait 6 hours for any sort of painkiller and I was in agony. Luckily I have a high pain threshold yet I was still writhing in the bed. I remember the two nurses that were nice very well because I felt every one else was vile to me. No one realised I had massive blood loss from rupture to the point of passing out frequently until after my operation and then they said there was no point doing anything about it now. They left a piece of bag in me during the operation which they can't find. I needed a wheelchair to get to the toilet but then while I was in there they took it away and I had to get back myself while passing out. I didn't have a buzzer and had to disturb others when I needed help. They kept forgetting for hours to change my drip. They told me they were monitoring my urine but they weren't, and before my scan they kept telling me I was making it up and looking for attention. Then after my operation they told me to go home without any money in the middle of the night, without any explanation as to why it happened. \n\nI still want to know why they think I had an Ectopic pregnancy, because beforehand they were saying I was so healthy they didn't understand it, and after the operation I was told nothing. Now I'm scared that whatever was wrong with my left tube is wrong with my right, but I was told nothing. I have been to this hospital again about agonising shoulder pain (which I had when I was pregnant) and they have told me I am imagining it and am being stupid. This experience will stay with me always. I'm so fed up of this hospital I will never go again, and recommend it to no one.", "This is a long & ongoing saga and almost a comedy of errors & negligent care of my mother by both the GP & hospital trusts....\nInitially for a few years now since being diagnosed as diabetic my mothers weight had constantly & slowly been reducing & this had been noted at the GP surgery.  At no time was there a suggestion that perhaps she should visit a dietician to find out why.    Now taking the saga on to Autumn 2012 .... she has suffered from catarrh for some considerable time....but this had started to become very dark & green & infected .... so went to the GP for help, only to be told it was nothing & they offered no treatment.\n\nFlash forward to late 2012 & my Mother was feeling very poorly indeed...weak, tired & having difficulty breathing. She visited her GP & without even being examined by the GP she was told there was nothing wrong & to go home.\n\nThe next morning she was very ill & her blood glucose level spiked to 32 so my father called an ambulance & she was rushed into & admitted to Intensive Care at Scunthorpe General Hospital with pneumonia & what at the time they thought may have been a stroke.  A separate formal complaint has been sent to the GP & PALS about this treatment by the GP.\n\nAfter a couple of weeks in ICU they determined that she had not had a stroke & was receiving excellent care but due to a staffing/bed shortage she was transferred to ICU at Hull Royal Infirmary.  This caused a great many problems with my elderly father being unable to visit at Hull due to his own health problems & issues with driving at night.  We worked round those problems by temporarily moving him in with my sister who lived nearer Hull & one person taking him to Hull while someone else would pick him up 6 hours later. We actually spoke to PALS & both our & her MP's about this at the time.\n\nWhile in Hull (again receiving excellent care) she contracted another chest infection, but doctors also looked into other medical problems & carried out many tests & although tests showed negative they started treatment for myasthenia gravis.  Now the chest infection appeared to have masked the results but she did start to improve.\nLast month she was transferred back to ICU at Scunthorpe & continued to improve & about a week later was moved to Ward 22 .\nNow the errors & neglect really started.   Her nasal feeding tube was removed & the staff told her they were going to remove her tracheotomy tube either that day or the next which perked her up no end.  From that point she was receiving no nutrition as she was still being treated as Nil by Mouth. Come the next morning morning the Doctor did his rounds & told her that he was not willing to remove the tube at this time & that the feeding tube would need to be replaced.   This distressed her & she said she did not want that tube back in but after being lectured by family members she agreed.   The tube was not put back in.   Come the following day (so now 72 hours without nutrition) the tube was still not back in & when I questioned the nurses they said it was because she had refused it.   We know that after that initial refusal she had agreed (so I pointed this out & demanded they put it back).  Eventually three days after removal the tube was reinserted & around 96 hours after being removed, feeding by the tube was restarted.  However it does not appear that anyone has been checking her blood glucose levels during this time (not feeding a diabetic patient for 4 days).  It was also not clear if she was receiving any insulin after having been on pumped in insulin for 8 weeks in ICU & also not clear if she had been receiving her medication for the hypertension which she also suffers from.\n\nTo top all this off, it also appears that since being transferred from Hull Royal Infirmary (where the doctors told us they were still convinced that she was suffering from myasthenia gravis & that the medication was the reason for her improvement) that this treatment had not been continued at Scunthorpe! \n\nWe are sure looking at the decline in her health over a 72 hour period that the staff were negligent & were leaving her there to slip into a coma & die.\n\nA couple of days after having the feeding tube replaced they removed the tracheotomy & tube & have put my mum onto a regular diet.   Doctor visited & said they was very pleased with her progress & that the hope now was to start intensive rehab & physio to get her fit to return home which she was pleased about. Her chest infections have all cleared up but in my opinion the nursing care still leaves a bit to be desired.  For example, as she is on a respiratory ward & not in need of great amounts of nursing care we feel she is largely ignored.   On the first day of being put in a chair beside her bed, she leaned forward & fell onto the floor.  She was there for almost half an hour before someone came to assist her back into the chair.\nUntil now she has received no rehab (8 days after being told this would start).\nOn the whole my mothers care has been a comedy of errors and while we cannot praise the staff in either the Hull or Scunthorpe ICU depts enough, care beyond that has been laughable & as we said we consider bordering on gross negligence.  Senior nursing staff on Ward 22 are at best aloof,  worst rude & tell the family absolutely nothing despite promises of daily updates.\nThe whole situation has also been reported to the hospital through my mum's MP.....but as yet over 2 weeks after he wrote....he has not yet received a reply.\n\n\n\n", "Thank you very much for your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear about your experience. I can confirm we have received this complaint and will be responding very soon. In the meantime, you are very welcome to request a meeting with Trust staff if you would like to discuss your concerns in person.\r\nKind regards,\r\nSarah Mainprize", "My mother was badly neglected by her gp, when she finally got through to the GP that her right hip was so painful and she was unable to walk, the gp reluctantly agreed to send her for a x-ray. \n\nThe consultant was shocked by what he had found and it was put down to neglect.   My mother was so pleased \"at last someone was believing her\" but after months of going back and forward, the hospital too began to neglect her. She has sadly lost her fight for life now. I know, and I'm sure that all the stress of both gp and hospital neglect helped towards this (2yrs). \n\nI think they used her blood pressure as an excuse to keep cancelling the operation. Cross is not the word I'd use. If there was a problem with her blood pressure, this should have been looked into properly, surely? Why treat people like this? It's disgraceful and I did get into it with the NHS long before she died. They said they would look into it and get back to me. I'm still awaiting a reply.   I want this kind of treatment to stop. ", "I suffered severe anxiety and depression after the birth of my second child and due to the environment I was living in (with an alcoholic husband), and the need to prove to him I could cope, I self medicated with alcohol to deal with the constant anxiety and ended up with a chronic alcohol problem. \nI was admitted to Stretton Ward on several occasions mainly to deal with alcohol detox, but also for depression. The unit is first and foremost set up to treat patients with drugs and I think very little else. What I wanted more than anything else was to TALK to somebody professional and to actually get to the root of the problem rather than merely be a drug receptacle and be monitored.\nThe staff I encountered were very much unavailable and spent a lot of time in the office 'doing handover' and the staff on the desk, although very pleasant seemed to be mainly there to chase escapees and fill in charts of what patients have eaten and when they slept. \nI felt pretty much on my own at a time when I have never felt more vulnerable, frightened and anxious. Other patients may have severe psychotic illnessess with quite bizarre behaviour, but staff do not seem to monitor this or provide duty of care to others on the ward. \nWard rounds are positively medieval and totally demeaning whereby the patient is paraded ( a bit like a Victorian freak show } in front of an audience of social workers and associated professional workers as if to demonstrate just how mad they are. I personally found ward rounds the most anxiety provoking demeaning experience of my whole stay. \nI also experienced abuse on this ward. I had leave out and went for a coffee with a fellow inmate to the hospital coffee shop just to escape the eternal boredom on the ward. I overstayed my leave time and on return to the ward I was alcohol tested. It proved, according to the staff member, to be positive for alcohol and no other member of staff monitored the testing. I know I had only had coffee and the only logical answer is the member of staff fixed the result. I was told I was not allowed any more time off the ward and I was to remain locked up 24/7 if I wished to stay. I protested and asked for a blood test as I knew I could prove I had not been drinking but I was told to keep quiet by other staff. I am happy to name the member of staff who did this to me. I am totally shocked that this happened in the NHS whilst treating an extremely vulnerable person. This person had the power to restrict my freedom and did so without impunity. Even worse, I was told by them that if I didn't like it I should leave and they pushed the forms in my face for me to sign. I was tempted but I knew if I left I would probably have attempted suicide.\n\nTo sum up psychiatric care at the Brandon Unit, I felt it was woefully inadequate. There are some very good members of staff but I felt the majority spent most of their time dishing out medication and filling in charts and avoiding communication with patients. We are treated as if we are troublemakers if we protest or question our diagnosis. Of course we are mentally ill and are not capable of having an opinion and that means that everything can be swept under the carpet. \nEventually after years of admissions to the Brandon Unit I went into rehabilitation treatment for alcohol problems and through counselling developed a greater understanding of my underlying problems. This has led to a full recovery from depression and alcohol problems. Why on earth couldn't the Brandon Unit achieve this? Not once did anyone ever take the time to get to the root of the problem.\nIt's my opinion that the whole culture of psychiatric care needs to change. Of course drugs are vital but there needs to be a more person centered holistic approach which meets the needs of the patients. I know that time spent talking with patients is costly, however that is what I needed most to sort out my problems which led to depression anxiety and drinking.", "May we first of all offer our sincere condolences for the loss of your mother.\r\nWe are extremely saddened to read that you feel your mother had such a poor experience with us.

My GP sent me to Epsom Hospital to have the X-rays done. I found out there that \"there is nothing wrong with it\" and I was recommended to take painkillers. They didn't help, so I was sent to a physiotherapist for 6 treatment sessions. I followed every instruction the physiotherapist told me but it didn't have any good result at all so I ended up back at my GP. He didn't know what to do so I was given a steroid injection which made this pain even worse and I was unable to move my whole arm for at least 24 hours. \n\nWhen my GP found out this didn't help, he told me to keep taking painkillers and I was told I'd be sent a letter with an appointment for a Shoulder clinic. I got this letter six weeks after this with an appointment made for another six weeks from this date. I decided to try a chiropractor, where I had to pay \u00a339 per 20 mins session and also decided to have the shoulder checked abroad where I had to pay for it. It took the doctor abroad 5  minutes to find out what's wrong with it by using an ultrasound. He found out that one of the nerves is partially torn in two places and that an operation is necessary. \n\nI came back to the UK, asked my GP to send me to the ultrasound, which he did and they found out the same. The doctor who did the ultrasound in Epsom Hospital was very surprised that my GP hadn't sent me there in the first place. Apparently that was what he was supposed to do when the X-rays didn't show anything. This means that I was given a steroid injection that could have possibly made my shoulder problem even worse. I was also told that my GP shouldn't have done so without knowing what was wrong with my shoulder. I am very disappointed with this situation. I believe that the reason why he didn't treat me the way he was supposed to is mainly because I'm not English. \n\nI'm really having big problems with my shoulder at the moment and it's getting worse. I'm only 23 and if this is not treated properly, I could have problems for the rest of my life. If he had treated me the way he should have, I could have had my shoulder fixed already. It is absolutely unacceptable to leave it like this. The only thing he was supposed to do is send me to the ultrasound. I felt he was almost laughing at me every time I came to his surgery. I spent a lot of money just to find out what's wrong with it and I think I should get it back. The worst thing about all of this is the injection I didn't have to be given that might have made it all worse. Doctors shouldn't work for the NHS if they don't want to help people.", "Last year I had my Gall Bladder removed using keyhole surgery - all appeared to go well, but two days later I was delivered by ambulance to Glasgow Western A&E. \nI was admitted to a ward and many tests were done over the next day where it was found that bile was leaking into my stomach. Having found the problem swiftly the surgeon had me nil by mouth every night for a week on the promise that the next morning I was to be taken back to surgery to have the leak fixed - it  never happened. On the morning round where I broke down in tears when the surgeon told me they wanted to \u00a8wait and see for another day\u00a8.  I felt the surgeon was extremely short with me and told me this was the way it was so keep taking the morphine.\nI wish I could have kept taking the morphine, as this surgeon\u00b4s lack of bedside manner became wholly irrelevant when a new shift of nursing staff came on the ward. By this time, and with a stomach full of very painful acid, I could barely walk, it would take me two hours to hobble to the loo, you could ring the buzzer all day if you liked as no-one came - ever. When they made their rounds I would beg for the morphine only to be told that they were too busy to have two nurses running off to get the drugs for me and anyway I would become addicted then never get home. \nThank God for the night shift as they would come in and I would at last get some pain relief. \nThe lack of care I think can be summed up by the nurse who had to be brought to me by another patient (as answering buzzers did not happen- ever) when she saw that I had collapsed in the shower she was disgusted that I was lying naked, asked why I had not covered myself up (was unable to move) and threw a towel at me and left never to reappear. Thankfully two elderly patients realised she was not coming back and came to help me up.\nThankfully the story ends better as my surgeon went on holiday, the new one came round for the handover and was shocked that no-one had operated as waiting and seeing was only serving to have more acid pour into my stomach. \nI was on his operating table a few hours later and sent over to Gartnaval Hospital the next morning where I received all pain relief, nurses were shocked that I had lost over a stone and a half in weight in a week and that no nurse from the Western had put in my notes that I had not eaten all week (remember the fasting every day? ). \nThis ended as a three week nightmare with a toddler and baby at home not knowing when Mummy was coming home. A\nI am embarrassed by how I was treated as normally I would never allow this, but in so much pain you are at their mercy.\nI could not fault the care of the nurses at Gartnaval, everyone from surgeon to cleaner had time to talk to you and help, however I would not leave a rat in the \u00a8care\u00a8 of the staff I came into contact with at the Western and every other hospital in Scotland would have to be shut before I would allow myself or anyone in my care to be admitted there.", "My experience with the NHS was pretty poor.\nHaving experienced abdominal pain and fever over a weekend, and it not having eased on Monday, I called NHS-24 At about 11pm on a monday night. They told me to immediately attend GEMS (out of hours service) at my local hospital where I was seen by a doctor who diganosed a possible appendicitis. The hospital where GEMS is located is non-surgical so the Dr sent me immediately to glasgow's flagship hospital, Glasgow Royal Infirmary (GRI). He gave me a letter to hand in saying I needed priority assessment and also phoned the receiving surgeon at GRI and asked them to see me immediately. \nOn arrival to GRI the reception staff took some details and asked me to wait in the waiting area. This was now about 12: 15AM on Tuesday morning. About 1 hour later I was seen by a triage nurse, who did not examine my abdomen at all, just took my temperature and blood pressure and sent me back to the waiting are. \nAfter a further 2 hours in the waiting area I was getting weaker and weaker and my pain was steadily getting worse and worse. At about 3am I asked my wife to go see what was happening as I could no longer sit, I was about to pass out and needed somewhere to lie down. They told me I'd be seen soon. \nAbout 3: 15am I was called through to A&E and put on a trolley. A nurse took my obs and also took a blood sample. I did not see a doctor at that point. No one examined my abdomen. I was literally rolling in pain on the trolley and no one came toassess me. At about 6am a trainee nurse came to take my obs again and we begged her to find a doctor so I could be seen. (We were also told we needed another blood sample because the first one had not been analysed and had 'gone off'. ) The nurse literally grabbed a Doctor by the elbow and brought them to me.  Appendicitis was diagnosed and an emergency theatre slot booked.  I was prescribed Morphine for pain release. At about 8AM I was given more morphine and was told I'd be going to theatre soon. About 10am a bed became available on a ward and instead of going to theatre I was sent there. A doctor on the ward cancelled the theatre slot and and refused to give me any further pain relief until I'd been seen by the consultant. We were told we'd just have to wait. I was in the most unimaginable pain, struggling to stay conscious and just wanted to die by this point. I told my wife I couldn't take any more and wanted to slip away. She insisted that the doctor do something NOW due to the condition I was in. She knows me well and could see I was fading fast. Reluctantly the doctor contacted the consultant who again diagnosed either appendicitis, peritonitis or a ruptured bowel. \nI was in such a state that he gave me an immediate morphine shot in the arm and sent me to theatre as an emergency. It took the NHS over 11 hours from first presenting to them with abdominal pains to being properly diagnosed. 10 hours in the GRI before being seen by the person who had any authority to do anything. 7 Hours on a trolley with no pain relief. I can tell you without any exaggeration that I got to theatre with no time to spare. What was supposed to be a 45 Minute operation to remove appendix with laparoscopy took over 4 hours due to complications in surgery. We believe this was because the appendix had ruptured and spilled in the abdominal cavity and also due to the advanced gangrenous state of the appendix.\nPost-surgery the care from the nurses and ward staff was fantastic - they could not have been better.\n* It should not have taken 11 hours to have been given a diagnosis.\n* The first blood sample should have been analysed and that would have shown the seriousness of my condition.\n* The diagnosis of the Doctor at GEMS and the Dcotor in A&E were not believed and ignored.\n* The priority letter from the doctor at GEMS was ignored.\n* The first blood sample was ignored.\nI believe a huge contributing factor was the use of the 'NEWS SCORE' as a means of assessment. If like me you are normally strong and fit and can put a fight against pain then the NEWS SCORE will let you down. You can easily be at deaths door and still get a NEWS SCORE of only 0 or 1\nI believe GRI has a policy of not letting you see a surgeon until a bed is available. \nPost-op I developed a wound infection and had to be re-admitted. Again I was left in A&E from 12: 15PM till after 6PM before anyone had even looked at the wound. This is not acceptable.", "My daughter was due to have an operation. We have to travel many miles, using the ambulance taxi service to get to Manchester.\nDespite this, outpatient appointments, the operation itself, and follow ups were/are frequently cancelled at the last minute leading to a huge amount or reorganising of taxis, hotels and my full time employment, where leave must be taken and my own patients cancelled. \nAn apology, in our experience, seems to be impossible at this hospital and from what we've seen - one department does not talk to another; the medical secretaries we've encountered have been especially arrogant and rude. \nIt transpires the diagnosis was a hypothesis rather than a 'fact' and surgery was not in fact required as..it is hypothesised AFTER surgery...the condition had corrected itself before surgery! My daughter's surgery was therefore unnecessary and we were not told this was even a possibility, let alone been given any alternative options to surgery. \nWe were presented with 'facts' that were based on a radiology report on an apparently vague and unreliable scan...we were therefore completely misinformed and not given a chance to make an informed choice. \nSurgery would NOT have been an option had we been given the correct information we'd been asking for. My child has now got to recover, with two large scars, from an unnecessary operation. \nWe found the bank nurse assigned to us was incompetent; they repeatedly read the medication chart wrong giving the excuse that they'd 'forgotten their glasses etc', took us to x4 operating theatres by mistake, had to be told they needed to go to recovery with me, disappeared while my daughter was in theatre for 3-4 hours rather than the expected one hour - during which no information other than, 2 hours later, 'there are complications'. \nThis was traumatising and my daughter woke up in sheer terror, with a sky high temperature, in extreme pain. The consultant, refused to allow me to see the notes - I had to make a written data protection act request which I gave to the nurse at the time, and again requested via email - despite strict legal timescales I have still not received these. \nThe doctor spoke to us and agreed that further scans before an operation would have been prudent but did not happen. They agreed to see us at a Saturday clinic as we are now needing to take unpaid leave due to staying in hospital far longer than we were told was needed. The medical secretary has now said we cannot have this as the doctor only does appointments at certain times in the week. This is despite the fact the entire conversation was heard by her father and grandfather, a retired GP, as I told the doctor I was on the phone to them at the time and they wanted to hear what had occurred. \nWe are still waiting for an appointment (the follow up was in any case cancelled by RMCH for unrelated reasons). We had no follow up or discharge information on the type of stitches, wound care, when to resume school etc. We waited 9 hours for staff to give simple medication and call the ambulance taxi (never any problem when called by the patient directly so I can only assume it was due to a problem with RMCH staff). \nThe health visitor here was upset as they only got an answerphone referral asking them to do a follow up on a Sunday (when they don't work). We were finally called back recently (for a Sunday appointment) by the Medical Secretary who made no reference to the fact that we had been promised a Saturday follow up and have witnesses to that and talking over me to rebook a Wednesday appointment. \nThe communication, and care itself here, has been appalling and utterly disrespectful in our experience. It has been, and continues to be, a traumatic and unnecessary ordeal. We no longer trust that, when an appointment is given or solution offered, RMCH staff will honour it. \nI wish for explanations in writing first and foremost to ensure our daughter is WELL (and that I can actually get to my own work around the shambles of RMCH cancelling and not honouring appointments). \nI find it hard to believe that an NHS trust, and it's staff, can operate in such a shockingly disorganised, disrespectful and lax clinical manner.", "We are very sorry to receive your comments and concerns via the Patient Opinion website about your experiences at RMCH.\r\nIt is very difficult to respond to the specific concerns you have raised without being able to investigate in detail. We take all issues surrounding patient care very seriously and would very much like to hear from you directly about this.\r\nIf you contact our Patient Advice and Liaison Service on 0161 276 8686 or by e-mailing pals@cmft.nhs.uk they will be happy to discuss this with you.", "I have had problems with mental health for around 8 years on and off. I recently have come down with a really bad episode of depression and suicide thoughts.\nThe suicide thoughts have become extremely difficult to control, I have been to the GP numerous times in the last 3 months, trying to get hold of help. In the last 3 months I have been in contact with the crisis team twice, both times expressing very strongly that I feel as bad as I do with suicide thoughts. They are aware that I have the means and a plan to attempt suicide. Both times they have let me walk away feeling as bad as I do. Last time I was told that it would be a shame as I'm only young....I felt extremely patronised and left very angry and upset that my cries for help were so clearly being ignored.\nI am now at a stage where I am struggling greatly on a daily basis, but fear using the systems we have in place as I feel again I would be ignored, and to be sent away again, with a sentence as patronising as that again, I wouldn't be able to cope with.\nI am extremely disappointed with the mental health services that are available in my area. Even the mental health worker I have been referred to can't do regular appointments. This is an illness that is exceptionally difficult to handle at the best of times, but it feels like the mental health services have the same stigmas attached with then as everyone else.\nI need help, I've admitted that, I have struggled to accept and admit I need help, but now I am, it feels like I'm taking 1 step forward and 5 steps back. what more help can I get?", "My son came to your hospital twice. He was told he had no broken ribs twice. he passed away 4 days after this. I feel your care is an utter mess and that this hospital needs a good shake up. I heard people moaning about their dinner when my son was fighting for his life. I believe the care was appalling. ", "The whole experience has been a nightmare. I have been left in debilitating pain since donating one of my kidneys. Doctors who I have seen have later denied seeing me.\nI feel I have been lied to, passed a copy of MIMS to point out a drug that I would like prescribed - it almost felt like abuse. I cannot work anymore and have to fight for every penny provided to be able to live.\nMy husband is doing very well but should I be left like this? I have a copy of my medical records so I do know what has been done to me. ", "My partner had a colonoscopy and was sent to stepping hill after rectal bleeding. This showed no problems and we felt very fortunate. This story is to encourage patients to not accept no further investigation. He had bowel cancer that was further up than a colonoscopy shows and we did not know this. Nobody including his GP asked him about family history which there is and a scan would have shown a sizeable tumour which had spread upwards in the year following his all clear. If we had known, we would have had a private scan as we have done before and there would be no need for this story. Bottom line is you have to arrange things for yourself. Please don't rely on hospital diagnosis or GPs. We have lost a special person. Don't be the next.", "My mother was admitted at the end of November 2012 with acute pancreatitis caused by gall stones. In her late 70s and in good health with excellent mobility, she deteriorated quickly in my opinion due to staff not wanting to administer drugs through iv or injection. They were adamant my mother was 'refusing' medicines but all she was saying was that they made her gag, then vomit, making the drug useless. It took a stand up argument by myself to get them to administer drugs alternately which is ridiculous. \nI was with my mother when she became 'septic' and went into shock. A student nurse kept insisting my mother was fine, just a bit cold. Again I had to go and find a senior nurse myself who immediately called for a consultant and mum spent weeks in critical care, who were wonderful I must say. \nWhen mum was eventually sent back to a normal ward, once again I felt the treatment was appalling. She was bed bound and her drinking water and glass were left well out of her reach as was the buzzer for her to call for assistance.\nAs she was in a side room, no one would have known if she required urgent attention. Faeces were left on the floor along with discarded medical items and packaging. I spent most of visiting time cleaning up the room. The television only worked on two occasions during the 3 months mum spent in hospital meaning that she became very withdrawn due to no stimulation. \nSome nurses were helpful but most of the ones I met would not offer any help or time to explain any of the procedures that were done. On many occasions, mum was told she could come home only for another member of staff to say she couldn't come home. Some nurses were heard gossiping between themselves while relatives were left to wait for assistance and queued up to ask about their relatives.\nA care package was 'organised' by physio but the day before mum was discharged, we were told she would not need one even though she could not walk unaided or get up from the bed herself. When mum returned home, we were constantly at her home because of her lack of mobility. \nIn my opinion, this is an appalling hospital with no idea of how to treat patients like human beings. I pray I never have to be hospitalised there.\n", "My daughter was referred to the Opthalmic Department at Warrington General Hospital by her optician in August 2012 and received an appointment to see a specialist in October. We arrived early for this appointment and had to wait a very long time before being called in to have an eye test.\nWe then had to wait in a different area until being called in by a junior doctor who carried out an examination, tested her eye pressure etc but stated that she could not tell us anything and that we would have to see a senior doctor. We then had to go back out and wait to be called. After a period of time we were called in, the senior doctor carried out a further examination and then said I want my boss to have a look at you and sent a Junior Doctor to fetch this specialist.\nBy this time it was approaching 3hrs since our appointment time, when eventually the specialist (the person we had been told originally that our appointment was with) came into the room, carrying various things including a newspaper and wearing a coat and outside garments. They never acknowledged that either of us were in the room just spoke to the senior doctor. They then slammed the paper on the desk, removed their coat and said they would take a look.\nThe examination lasted less than 30 seconds and made both of us feel like we were an inconvenience. They then mumbled something to the senior doctor, marked a sheet and picked up their stuff and left.  They appeared to be in a hurry to leave and we were both of the opinion that the senior doctor was taken aback by his actions, I don't think they knew what to say at that point. I asked what happens now and the senior doctor said that my daughter needed further tests and that the optician was correct about the swelling at the back of the eyes. They passed us a form and told us to hand it in at reception, which was closed. Only cleaners were present so we posted the form in a box at reception.\nA follow up appointment was received for December. My daughter rang the hospital to request an earlier appointment as she didn't want to feel that the appointment would be rushed or stop anyone from being able to go home on time. She was told that the next available appointment was late January 2013, therefore she decided to keep the original appointment offered. Once again we arrived early, prior to the appointment time, and she was called in after only 5 minutes. She had an eye test and was told to sit in the waiting area. After another 10 minutes we were called and taken down the corridor for a field test which took about 30 minutes. We were then told to sit and wait in the corridor. We seemed to be waiting around 45 minutes before a member of staff came into the corridor (a public area) and proceeded to ask my daughter personal questions. They then went back into the room. About 30 minutes later, during which other staff approached and stated 'it won't be long' which seemed very strange, the member of staff came back out and informed us that my daughter had been put in the wrong clinic. They informed us that they could not see her as this would be taking another consultant's patient. At this point I interjected, in disgust, as we had already been at the hospital for over 2 hours. I said to this member of staff that first of all they should not be asking personel questions in the corridor and then asked who had made the mistake; the consultant or the clerical staff. At this stage the sister on duty intervened and proceeded to try to find out what had happened.\nOnce again we were left to sit and wait, after around 20 minutes the sister returned to advise us that there had been a mistake (but didn't state by who) and went in to see the member of staff. The member of staff then came out into the corridor and informed us that they would see my daughter if it was an emergency otherwise she would have to rearrange the appointment. We objected on the basis that she had already been waiting since being referred in August, and knew that potentially the swelling could indicate the presence of a tumour and she had taken a day off work to attend. I said that the way she had been treated was disgusting. Every time my daughter attends an appointment she loses money by having to take time off work. I said that it was not acceptable to wait for a further appointment and therefore she would like to see this member of staff. We then had to wait again whilst this person saw another patient before calling us in. Also present in the room at this time was a student in their final year and the sister. The member of staff examined Catherine's eyes. The sister left during the examination and then came back into the room and spoke to the member of staff who then told us that they had managed to get us the tests done, that they could not do in her surgery, and to go with the sister to get pictures taken.\nWe were made to feel that we should be thankful for having this done by the sister as they said that the lady taking the pictures was staying behind in her own time to do them. Pictures were taken and we then returned to the waiting area, and after 5 minutes the member of staff came to the door with the lady who had taken the pictures and informed us that more pictures had to be taken. We went with the lady again and had more black and white pictures taken and returned to the waiting area. After around 10 minutes the member of staff called us in again and showed us the colour pictures and the deviations on them, which the member of staff explained they hadn't expected to see. They then referred to the black and white pictures and told us that if my daughter had been born with this condition the pictures would glow, but they didn't and just showed a black square. They then said that they didn't want us to be concerned but as a precaution they were going to arrange for her to have an urgent brain scan before Christmas and that we would be contacted shortly.\nAs my daughter had not heard anything by late December she phoned the hospital and spoke to the member of staff's secretary. The secretary informed her that they had checked and confirmed that the scan had been requested in mid December, and that my daughter should receive a call as a letter would not get to her in time. My daughter was worried that it was getting close to Christmas and the secretary advised her that they did the scans in the evening and over the weekend, so the appointment would be before or just after Christmas so they advised her not to worry.\nOn the following day, my daughter received a letter regarding an appointment for a MRI scan at Runcorn Hospital for mid January. She contacted the hospital and was informed that the member of staff's secretary was not available until the following day and a message was left for them to contact her in the morning. She therefore called the MRI centre to explain the circumstances and to request an earlier appointment but was told that the request they had received had not been marked as urgent and that she would have to contact the hospital. As she had not received a call by 11am on the following day, she called the member of staff's secretary who said they would look into it and someone would call her back. \nMy daughter received a call from a someone and explained what had happened. They said they would ask the specialist that our original appointment was with to look at the notes. This person then rang back around an hour later to tell my daughter that the specialist had said all the tests were fine and that it was just a routine (non urgent) scan. I took the phone off her and spoke to this person directly. I told them that I didn't accept the specialist's comments as they had not examined my daughter properly in the first instance. I said I wanted a second opinion and that if it turned out that she does have a tumour, I would sue the Hospital for negligence. I was then told that if I wished to make a complaint to contact PALS. \nI phoned PALS and left a message requesting a call back. As I didn't receive a call back I called again and spoke to someone. I explained what had happened and they told me to make a complaint to the Chief Executive and that they would speak to PALS. I then got a call from another member of the PALS team (more senior) and explained in great detail yet again what had happened. This person informed me that they had tried to get the appointment (scan) brought forward without success, I told them this was unacceptable and that I would be making a formal complaint.\nI sent a formal complaint the next day, this was late December, and received an acknowledgement letter dated 6 days later, stating that consent was required to access my daughters records and that I should expect a reply within 30 working days. A further letter dated early January stated that a response would be provided by mid February.\nNo urgent MRI was arranged and the appointment/scan was carried out on in mid January as previously arranged. Despite following this formal complaint up via phone call and email after the date stated in mid February, I then received a further letter stating that a further two weeks was required to complete their enquiries and to provide a written response.\nTo date I have not received any further response, which suggests to me that the hospital simply can't be bothered to respond to formal complaints and appear not to care about how patients are treated or what their concerns are.\nIt would be useful to know where I can take this complaint to next, as I believe the hospital doesn't take complaints seriously!\nMy daughter has ended up having to have a lumber puncture which caused an ongoing problem with severe headache which resulted in her going back into hospital via ambulance and is now waiting to see a neurologist.", "My son was experiencing abdominal pain which started in the morning, it got progressively worse as the day went on. I called NHS 24 in the afternoon which by this time it was severe. I was told someone would call back in an hour. He got worse very quickly, I called back and was told someone would call back within 2 hours. \n\nEvery time I called I asked if there was somewhere I could take him myself as I had transport. By this time he was screaming in agony. I called an ambulance and was told this was not an emergency and they would refer me to NHS 24. I called NHS 24 again. I was told to take him to the local infirmary at 6: 30 P. M. I thought he would be seeing a doctor, it was a nurse who then sent us to another town 20 mins away. The Dr. there arranged for him to go to the hospital, I took him there which took another hour. \n\nHe was operated on at around 11: P. M. His appendix had burst by then and was badly infected. \n\nThis was a very frightening experience for us. My son was very unwell afterwards. I am very upset at the way we were treated. We were told it was not an emergency when it clearly was. My son suffered excruciating pain much longer than he should have and still could suffer complications from this.

Luckily, I am not a patient with diabetes, if I was, I would not want to attend that clinic!\n\nMy friend had an appointment in afternoon , she was told by the receptionist to come in early because she needed to fill out a questionnaire, and so we arrived at the diabetes centre at approximately half an hour early. \nThe receptionist was okay, the nurse doing the bloods was friendly and smiling, so was a man called Chris who was a fitness person of some sort. There were various members of staff who would periodically come out of their room and walk through the waiting area, a smile might have been nice, especially for anxious patients on their first visit, but no, you wouldn't think there was anyone sitting in the waiting area. \n\nTime was ticking away but no one seemed to be called in to see the doctor, when she did appear, she wondered around, then went to get a bottle and filled it up from the water fountain, still not appearing hurried or anything!\nEventually a patient was called in to see her.\n\nThere appeared to be a lady who was rather breathless and she came in to enquire where she could park her car, as the car park was full up, she was told by the receptionist that she would have to park in the main hospital car park, it was obvious to me that the breathless lady would not be able to walk that far, but the lady had to explain that, to the receptionist, only to be told there is nothing else she can do. There were still a lot of people to be seen, so the car park was not going to empty any time soon! If she parked anywhere else near the building she would be clamped and probably have to a pay a \u00a340 charge!\nThe breathless lady had to cancel her appointment!\n\nAn hour had passed since the scheduled appointment time and my friend had still not be seen by anyone yet, so she enquired to see if this was usual and told that it was!There was a delay due to the fact that the doctor appeared to be 45 minutes late. Then this doctor had the cheek to try to refuse to see a patient because the patient was 5 minutes late! ! Luckily this was overcome and the patient was seen. \n\nThe doctor never smiled when calling a patient in to see her. In fact I never saw her smile at all. \nAnother patient, who I discovered had a lot of trauma in her life in recent years, came out very distraught from seeing this doctor, and said, well, that's me, well and truly told off!\nThis doctor told my friend that the reason all the appointments were delayed was due to the nurse who was taking the bloods, so she didn't even apologise for herself being so very late, just blaming it on the nurse who was one of the few who were kind, friendly and human and doing her job well!\n\nAll this time in the waiting area with no one making a statement or trying to say something to reassure people, it was all very strange.\nI wondered, while I was sitting there, if it was because we were all overweight, I remember a lady doing a test on the television to see what peoples responses were to overweight people, first of all she appeared in a town as herself, nice figure, long blonde hair and reasonably attractive, people responded to her well, striking up conversation and waiters in a cafe were friendly and attentive. Next she wore a type of padded body suit, her hair and face were the same and she followed the same routine of going into town and going to the same caf\u00e9 etc. as before, when she was slim. The response was totally different, she had odd looks, the waiter did not attend her straight away and when he did was so different in attitude toward her! She was shocked at the difference and it was a big eye opener to her.\n\nWhilst listening to people coming out from their appointment, it appeared their treatment was extremely off-hand, demeaning and unfeeling in the extreme, to such an extent it was evoking extreme distress in some, to extreme anger in others\nSurely this is not the standard of treatment that the patients should have to accept on top of their own personal difficulties. Not only was the doctors behaviour anti social, she was quite happy to push the blame for the delays onto an innocent engaging and good mannered nurse, who carried out her job with a genuine air of friendliness and efficiency.\nMy friend eventually got into see the doctor at approximately an hour and a half late and she too received the same unacceptable treatment by that doctor\n\nAs an overweight person myself, I know what it is like to be treated with extreme negativity, it is most definitely counter productive to any benefits that might otherwise be achieved and in the context of this clinic, I would judge it to have bordered on abuse of the patients and almost certainly the patients would have left quite dejected and traumatised by what should have been a beneficial consultation!", "Hi,\r\nWe have read your story and thought you'd like to know that we may be able to help if you want to give feedback or comments, or raise concerns or complaints to the NHS.

However, my hospital experience left a great deal to be desired.\nAlthough I was taken in by ambulance to Casualty at Kings Mill Hospital it took over an hour for a nurse to triage me, during which time the ambulance staff had to stand around waiting - what a waste of their valuable time. I don't remember anyone coming after that, though my husband says I was semi-conscious - enough to co-operate. Apparently I was taken for scans and then taken by blue-lighted ambulance to Queen's Medical Centre at Nottingham. Apparently I had a sub-arachnoid haemorrhage.\nThe passage below is an extract from the longer piece I wrote on Facebook:\n\"I came out of theatre something between 7 and 7 and a half hours later and don't really have any memory of coming out of anaesthetic or of knowing I was on Neuro Intensive Care. The next few days have no particular memories other than how unbelievably nasty and uncaring some of the nursing staff were. \nA couple of them did seem to care and went out of their way to help, but it was only a couple. What sort of caring nurse, who knows (or ought to know)that their patient has such poor eyesight as to be officially classed as visually impaired when uncorrected (my prescription is -14 in one eye and -10. 25 in the other)and also has congenital spinal deformities tells her patient she's lazy because she can't see to walk safely to the bathroom, then puts her an adult nappy on and forces her to walk despite the back pain which is so intense it makes her pooh her nappy? Even better, the nurse then grumbles at the patient so she has to clean herself up unsupervised in a shower because the staff have other patients who need them...God help us all if this our NHS now.\nSorry if that offends anyone who reads this, but this happened to me. I was in hospital for 11 days, during which time I lost 12 pounds in weight and quite literally couldn't find a position to rest in any degree of comfort. The mattresses were/are memory foam, which is probably great if you've a normal spine but don't give anything like enough support to a deformed spine. They eventually put me on to a totally new regime for pain relief, despite that fact that the routine I follow has worked well for over a decade and which they eventually (6 days down the line)put me back to. \"\nOn discharge I was given papers in which it said I'd be seen in 6 to 8 weeks; my appointment has come through for August - five months on. Apparently they are short of neuro consultants but can't afford to employ any more.\nWe've already contacted the hospital about all this but not received any useful reply. \nSurely things can be done better and more efficiently?

I will post another response as soon as I the response of our maternity staff.\r\nThanks Arlian", "I first got in touch with the patient experience team at the end of October 2012, when my father was in QEQM in Margate. He had been experiencing severe angina attacks and as a result was admitted a few days earlier.\nDue to the severity of his condition while in A&E, as is customary, he had received blood thinners; however he experienced an extreme reaction to that intervention and asked medical staff constantly during his entire stay, why he was experiencing various intense reactions and there was little interest shown and no investigations. I can confirm that he made this known several times within my hearing.\nHe had increased temperature, pain and other symptoms on the Friday and did receive monitoring on the first ward, however all of this ended when he was woken from his sleep and moved late on Saturday night to Fordwich Ward. He did not understand why he was being moved given how ill he was feeling, and he was not given the chance to properly express this. While being moved to Fordwich, he experienced an angina attack, he told the individual moving him. This was ignored and he was placed in Fordwich anyway.\nAfter his admission and the initial work in the first few hours, during the rest of his stay, he was not monitored with a heart monitor or any other equipment to gather data about his heart rhythms, nor was there any investigation using the ward based mobile echo equipment, despite him advising that he was experiencing increased feelings of congestion in his heart and regular and constant angina attacks. I did not see these being recorded in his notes, despite reminding the nurses to do so.\nWhile on the ward, he was kept awake all night by the shouting of a patient who was becoming violent and throwing objects and other patients with dementia, his three fellow patients in his section of the ward were in a state of undignified undress, exposing themselves to visitors and being unaware of doing so. This became the pattern for the following nights, getting little or no sleep. He felt unsafe and concerned.\nI contacted the patient experience team due to my very serious concerns that he was not on a proper regime of medical monitoring, plus he had not been attended by a doctor since the Friday. The only observations being taken were his blood pressure once in the morning and once in the evening. The ward filed an on-line incident report on the Monday regarding the lapse in the protocol regarding the doctors/ consultants not responding to their requests for them to attend him.\nAs a result, there was no data on his file, which would have provided information and medical detail for his doctors/consultants to make informed clinical decisions on his behalf. His verbal information, which was being repeated and given to everyone who came to his bedside, was also dismissed and ignored.\nDespite the complete lack of proper data regarding his condition, and showing no attention to his information, he was discharged from Fordwich on Tuesday morning, by a consultant who did not physically examine him. I believe that this visit was prompted by several phone calls by myself to the medical secretaries that morning. By this time my father was in an extreme state of anxiety and distress, given the lack of any proper attention from nursing staff and doctors. He was worried and concerned at his angina attacks and that no one was listening.\nPost discharge, the next day, I telephoned the hospital and spoke to the doctor who discharged him. I reported that he was experiencing angina attacks, even while at rest during the night, every four to six hours and was told that this was not an issue, and to continue taking his spray.\nA few days later, in the early hours of the morning, my father was taken by ambulance to QEQM. He was subsequently transferred to William Harvey in Ashford and spent the next two weeks in ITU, the high dependency ward and the Cambridge Ward.\nHe had suffered a severe heart attack and cardiogenic shock and was put on a balloon pump while in ITU and his life was in danger for several days. In addition, he suffered severe and unusual complications from his reaction to blood thinners. He has permanent heart damage as a result.\nI have some questions about the stay at QEQM:\n1. Why was the protocol for an unusual reaction to blood thinners not followed, when my father advised of his symptoms hours after his admission?\n2. Does his medical file show that he reported it?\n3. Are the angina attacks which he experienced during his stay at QEQM recorded fully and completely on his file? I personally, reported three attacks to the senior nursing staff, (which I have recorded electronically) and saw no notes made.\n4. Why did he not have a heart monitor, to record the angina attacks and to provide important information?\n5. Why did he not have even a basic examination of his heart using the ward equipment? this would have shown any change in the blockages in his arteries.\n6. Why was he not given a priority angiogram, nor any prospect of one, given that the last investigation had been two years ago?\n7. Why was he moved between wards on the Saturday night and no continuity of care provided?\n8. Why were there no proper medical observations made during his time on Fordwich?\n9. Why was his consultant name changed when he was moved to Fordwich, to that of a consultant who was on holiday and absent from the hospital, as confirmed to me by his secretary?\n10. Why did the doctors ignore the visit requests from Fordwich and fail to follow protocol and fail to respond to the nursing staff?\n11. Why, upon his readmission to QEQM A&E, was there no continuity in the hospital records to show his reaction to the blood thinners? This would have been invaluable information for the medical teams at the William Harvey and may have avoided severe, life-threatening complications subsequently.\n12. I have asked to see a full paper copy of ALL the medical records held at QEQM for my father, and any of his records held by the EKHT.\nIt is my contention, that during the first stay his medical record was not being fully and properly maintained. For example, I would expect that the many angina attacks he experienced should be in his notes. If that data is not present, then that will form the basis of some very serious questions about the failure in his care.\nIt is also my contention that his care did not follow the correct procedures and protocols. I suggest that as a result, his medical and nursing care was sub-standard and potentially negligent.\nTo be clear, my father and I am expecting a formal written report which addresses these issues - following a full and formal audit and review which conforms to the full Complaint Procedures, including statements following documented formal interviews with all relevant members of staff from the Trust. Plus a statement from the Trust detailing what will be done about the conclusions and findings.\nIt is now six months since I first contacted Patient Experience. I understand that there is a stated, expected response time within the process to respond to this sort of issue. I would have thought that given the severity of this matter, it would be given full and prompt attention. I am still waiting. So is my father.", "Thank you for posting your concerns via patient opinion and I am sorry that we do not appear to have handled your concerns effectively or in a timely way through the Patient Experience Team.

This was not acceptable and I apologise for this. I have been reviewing all of the feedback on the site as part of work to ensure that responses receive prompt and timely acknowledgement. \nI know how distressing it is when symptoms are not controlled as well as they might be at the end of life and was saddened to read that this was your Dad's experience. \nOur clinical teams are constantly reviewing and improving the ways in which they involve relatives with the care provided to those they love while they are in hospital - although I know it will be small consolation to you, I thought it important to take time to let you know that your feedback is appreciated and that I will ensure it is included in learning and improvement discussions that focus on the importance of ensuring that people don't have the experiences you have outlined.\nRespectfully yours, \nCraig White", "My son is severely disabled and is fed by a jejunostomy tube - a tube that goes into his stomach and then into his intestines so that he can have milk without reflux (being sick). The tube has to be inserted by an Interventional Radiologist in an Interventional Radiology laboratory. This is done at a Specilist Hospital in London where we go for  paediatric gastric care.\nLast week we were concerned that the tube had become displaced - that it had moved back to his stomach. We went to our local hospital where after an X-Ray, it was confirmed that this was the case. However, in discussion with the Specialist Hospital in London, it became clear that they would not be able to bring my son in to redo the Interventional Radiology procedure outside working hours. Hence, with a bank holiday, we were told that Matthew would have to wait 3 and half days before having his tube re-inserted and meanwhile he would only be able to be fed on water and diaralyte into his stomach - if given milk without the tube in place, there is too high a risk that he will be sick and aspirate (choke). This meant that Matthew was deprived of food from Friday afternoon until Tuesday lunchtime when the tube was successfully re-inserted at the Hospital in London.\nMy concern is my son was deprived of food for over 3 days because the specialist hospital does not have an emergency/on-call system for Interventional Radiology that supports doing these procedures out of hours or at the weekend. I do not think it is right to deprive a child of food for that long because of this and the specialist hospital that provides this service should put in place emergency access at the weekend to prevent vulnerable children being unnecessarily starved for several days at a time due to the unavailability of staff.\nI would also like to say that the medical and nursing care, when received, was excellent - my concern is the lack of system organisation to manage children like my son at the weekend and particularly a bank holiday weekend.", "I don't imagine you will publish my story. \nI was assaulted and abused by a rude, uncaring radiographer at Good Hope Hospital in April 2013.\nI wrote a letter of complaint to the Chief Executive a few days later. To date, I have not even received an acknowledgement and information about how my complaint will be dealt with.\nThere is no clear complaints procedure laid out in this website, which is unacceptable.\nThere is little point in only wanting nice stories from patients and ignoring those who are dealt with so badly they are in pain for 2 weeks and traumatised by their experience.\nIf I hear nothing in 24 hours I am going to go public with my complaint because I am so angry that I have been ignored.", "Thank you for raising this matter and I hope your son is now receiving the care that he needs. From your comment it seems that your issue of concern is with the specialist hospital and not with Frimley Park Hospital. However if this is not the case and you have any feedback about the care you received at Frimley Park please let me know and I will ensure it is followed up [james.taylor@fph-tr.nhs.uk].", "Thank you for your posting and I am so sorry you have not had a response to your complaint letter.

We take these comments seriously however, and we will highlight this to all staff via the staff hand-over meetings.\nThe usual pathway for women in labour is to contact maternity triage however support and advice can be obtained via the labour ward. Both areas are prone to high activity and there may be a delay in answering calls. It is however extremely unusual for the telephone not to be answered by any member of staff especially if ringing continues. We are able to access call and line usage but would require dates and times to follow this up. \nThe majority of mothers stay in the labour ward after delivery and are discharged home directly from their delivery room.  It would be the expectation that the linen should be changed if soiled, so that the mother may rest if required. Again the fact that this was not done will be highlighted to staff.\nStaff would normally advise on personal hygiene and care of the stitched area. However some mothers resistance is lower due to the tiredness associated with a new baby and they can be more prone to infections.  Having stitches does not mean that an infection will be acquired.\nWhen staff are not in the room, it is normal practice to ensure mothers have access to the call buzzer should assistance be required.   Again this, along with the height of beds, will be highlighted to staff.\nWe are sorry that you feel your experience has caused postnatal depression and a fear of having other children.  We hope you feel able to get help and support from your Health Visitor or GP but  If you wish to discuss any of these issues further please contact the unit on 01324 566000, and a member of the management team will be happy to speak with you.\n", "My dad was sent to Russell's Hall emergency department at the beginning of March 2011, by his doctor after being unwell and having some abnormal blood test results. \nHe was kept in this department for a couple of days while they kept taking more blood from him and running tests. They eventually sent him to a ward, where it was noticed by myself and my mother that he was acting strangely, I notified one of the nurses, they came and saw him, then told us it was our fault for overwhelming him with us being there - the family that he loved and was with him all the time.\nBy this point we were still no nearer to finding out what was causing my dad to be ill. We asked to see the consultant that was treating my dad, we had a meeting with the consultant where we asked them questions about what they thought was wrong with my dad but didn't really get any straight answers. \nBy this point in time, my dad was really beginning to deteriorate, his body swelled and he could no longer walk around, he was moved to another ward, this time a ward for stomach, liver and kidney problems, but we still had no answers for medical staff as to what was causing my dad to be so ill.\nHe became bedridden and developed massive swelling all over his body, nothing was ever done to reduce this swelling, he didn't eat or drink, and we began to notice that his toes were going black.\nHe was in so much pain, especially in his head, his tongue swollen so much that he could hardly talk and it was heartbreaking to see a man I loved so much in that much pain and he wasn't being treated for anything, they would give him morphine for the pain but that was it. He developed bruising all over his body, especially on his head and legs and yet they still didn't know what was wrong with him.\nHe died on Easter Sunday 2011, he had had a bleed in his stomach, and all his organs were failing, he couldn't breathe his lungs had filled with fluid, and we watched him die. It was the most painful day of our lives. The doctor said he died from multi organ failure and acute vasculitis, but still to this day we don't know what caused him to have organ failure or why nothing was done to stop things from getting so serious. He was in that place for 5 weeks and was only 66.\nI cannot fault the nurses on that last ward he was in, they tried their best to look after him and keep him comfortable, but to me, he never got any proper treatment from the doctors. I really believe that his death could have been prevented, and we still don't know why our dad died 2 years on.", "My mother suffered a stroke in April 2013.\nThe initial response was fantastic, the ambulance was with us in less than 10 minutes and the paramedics confirmed by opinion she was FAST positive (I am a trained nurse). She was taken to the HASU at Charing X and we were taken straight into critical care.\nAlthough I had known she was ambulant 90 minutes previously, as I hadn't actually had contact with her, they refused the thrombolysis treatment. She had a CT scan, which showed nothing, and was then taken to the stroke unit.\nShe became very drowsy due to the brain oedema and a CT scan done on day 3 showed the lesion by then. Apart from a paralysed arm, all her other limbs are fine and she has cognition. Her care was fantastic.\nThings took a turn for the worse when she was admitted to West Middlesex Hospital on day 3, late at night. On day 4 the Occupational Therapist called me and we chatted for nearly half an hour. During this time I informed her that my mother had severe hearing loss and she requested that I bring in her hearing aids. I also informed her that my mother had vascular dementia and gave her the details of who looks after this.\nOn day 5, I visited my mother in the afternoon. She was still very drowsy and not making eye contact, which is apparently normal for this type of stroke. I waited a long time to speak with the sister and by the time she turned up, I had to leave to get to work. I informed the staff that my mother couldn't hear and that I had left both her hearing aids and her distance vision glasses in her locker.\nSadly due to my husband's ill health, I was unable to visit my mother for about 10 days. When I visited again I was there for nearly 4 hours and during that time it became apparent that the ward staff had no idea that she was deaf, didn't know she had hearing aids with her and didn't know about her dementia.\nThey blamed Charing X for not providing the information, but when I explained that the OT had phoned on the day after admission and had received this information, they were astonished. They immediately gave her the hearing aids and once inserted she immediately responded to them. I believe that up to this point they thought she was badly brain damaged, even though the position of the lesion would not be expected to cause this.\nDuring my first and subsequent visit, I examined the nursing notes and informed staff that I was concerned about her coughing. She was not on oxygen assistance when transferred and has not been oxygenated since arriving at West Mid. Her sats were being maintained above 96% on room air, which is adequate. I asked if a chest X-Ray had been performed or was planned and received a negative reply. No one seemed to take my concern seriously.\nYesterday morning I received a phone call from the stroke SpR, informing me that my mother has a chest infection [only diagnosed yesterday, some 3 weeks after admission] and that she is very poorly and now on antibiotics.\nI am disgusted with the level of care she has received so far. It seems that if I can't be there every day (I work shifts 5 days a week and have an ill husband to look after), then nothing gets done. I have informed the SpR that I am making a formal complaint to the CEO and I fully intend to bring a medical negligence case against all involved in her stroke [she had been taken off anticoagulants and BP medication] from the so-called preventative medication, right through to the post-stroke care.\nThey are now running around like headless chickens and hopefully she is getting the right treatment, but I shouldn't have to kick up a fuss to get this treatment done properly. If I wasn't a trained nurse and could spot the warning signs, heaven knows what would have happened.", "After horrific side effects from a chemo drug and other complications my husband lost stones. In the first two weeks had lost three stones and still cannot walk.\nThe operation was four weeks ago there has been no nourishment or protein in his body for five weeks. I complained to the staff about the lack of food he was having and asked if I could see the chart with his food intake.  This was in Inverclyde, I was told no chart had been kept but they would start one.  I only found out about his weight loss because I asked him if they had weighed him he muttered something (he was extremely weak and could barely communicate). When I asked a nurse about the three stone losses they said I was must have got it wrong, so I asked for it to be checked I was told at that time that they can't force someone to eat. \nAs far as I was concerned that was like saying he would be left to die from starvation and that's when someone said it was right about the weight loss and they had notified the dietician. He was nauseous and said the food tasted like sand and he could only manage porridge and custard. I spoke to the dietician the following morning by phone and told her of my concerns she agreed to see him the next day.  \nWhen my daughter and I visited him that afternoon we asked to see the diet sheet, to see if we could help with anything on it. We could not read it and asked if the nurse would tell us what it said and she also had difficulty reading it.  In the end we managed to find out he was to have two special protein soup four 50ml total.  Twocal is another protein drink but not vanilla as that made him sick also four small bottles of milk. \nI asked to come in at lunch to see what he was eating, they came and asked what he wanted but he couldn't stomach anything on offer and neither would I have. When I asked about the special soup and diet that was to be provided, the nurses who were helping with the meals had no idea what I was talking about. They had obviously not been told to read his notes they went off to have a look and came back and offered the soup.  If I hadn't been there he would have been left to starve. He was given the large bottle of twocal in vanilla and when I asked why he wasn't given the milk he was supposed to have I was told he has to ask for it as they didn't know what he was to have. I told them I wanted the milk put on his tray whether he asks for it or not. \n\nI spoke to the dietician and asked what sense there was in her making a chart and no one paying the least bit of attention to it, things did not improve he is so week he can barely walk.   So on being told he was to be moved to the Larkfield Unit for intense physio we thought there would be a light at the end of the tunnel.  Nope, no intense physio up for a walk once a day, as they have 29 patients they can't give him two walks a day. They don't work the weekend and are off at Bank Holiday.  Why do they not have cover for the weekend, as far as I'm concerned the progress made during the week is lost as three days have passed and he needs two people to get him out of bed so they say they don't have the staff to deal with it, after the walk he is then left to sit on a chair. Due to my husband's condition his body and bones ache.\n I was only told tonight by someone that he had been left sitting on a chair for more than two hours and had pleaded to be allowed to get put back to bed but was told he would have to sit there as they hadn't time to do it. I am raging mad and will be looking for answers tomorrow he has now been in this unit for over a week and another dietician has been called in. \n\nTwo of the nurses can't make out what is written, why they can't type it or write in block capitals. I was also told by a nurse he had eaten two sandwiches and toast, when I queried this I was assured he had and I knew this was wrong as he couldn't eat any bread. I was also told he said he would like me to bring up a breast of chicken this was also wrong as the chicken has to be with roast and mash potatoes and loads of veg. I knew these were either wrong or they're mixing the patients information up. \nThis is beginning to read like a comedy sketch so I will not be taking this anymore.  The patients illnesses do not take a break so why are they left with no treatment at weekends and why are more staff not employed. The Scottish Parliament is going to be informed about the lack of staff and care in this centre. \nI would also like to comment on what someone else reported about Larkfield that is when they do get to answer the buzzers which can take quite a while. They say they will be back in a few minutes and they don't appear for up to an hour, and their answers are they are very short staffed. \nWho then is in charge of staffing in a unit such as this where bedridden patients need to be treated with dignity and respect and not left in fear of soiling themselves? There are a few really caring members of staff but they should not be put upon by ones who have no compassion and clearly should look to another profession. This report had better not have repercussions for my husband as they are taking on the wrong person.\nWhat I would really like to happen is that the administrators are shown my posts as I can't see what good it is in showing it to staff when they clearly can't do anything about it as the staffing levels are the responsibility of the Admin and I'm sure they are well aware of the problems in this Unit. and until they start to show they are genuine about patients welfare and not money nothing will ever change. \n", "Here is an extract of the failings of my father's care and this is an extract of the letter sent to the ward Matron and PALS. I can honestly say that I would not send another family member to that hospital ever again and that we would rather travel the extra distance and go to Sheffield. Not only is the care appalling but the lies and an excuse made up after to try to cover them is unbelievable and does nothing to help mourning family members.\nDear? I am writing to you because you were so honest and open with me about my father's condition. Sadly my father passed away in my arms within approx. 4 and a half hour of being at home. I had returned to West Yorkshire on the Sunday evening, due to a busy work schedule and to attend my mother in laws funeral on the Tuesday and was waiting for my youngest daughter to arrive back from America to break the news that her grandfather only had approx. 4 months left to live.\nMy daughter that lives in Chesterfield had spoken to the ward sister on my behalf on Monday 25th February at approx. 3. Pm. Here is an extract of the conversation. Basically much the same as you told me, but that:\nPneumonia was getting better, (anti-biotics for 7 days)\nFibrosis getting progressively worse.\nUnable to do another chest x ray because the pneumonia would show up scarring.\nTested without oxygen and seemed to be normal, however if making him feel better would be left in place.\nNot able to go back on Mirtazapine due to liver function. but would monitor and may go back on reduced dosage.\nStill catheterised\nPressure boots in place\nRed bottom not stage 1 not breaking, would be monitored\nEating little and often, hence weight gain.\nThat we had to choose one person for point of contact.\nWe had already inquired about getting my father back home because it was his wish, he felt that should he have to stay in hospital much longer he would die in there.\nMy daughter was told that getting him home could be arranged.\nHome oxygen could be arranged within 4 hours, can take 24 hours depending on circumstances\nSocial Services would be involved before discharge\nPalliative Care would be involved before discharge\nRight For Care Plan would be put in place along with\nDNAR form would need to be put in place if required.\nDue to my not being able to get back to Chesterfield until the Thursday evening it had been discussed that a family meeting would be held to decide on the point of contact. The majority of the family wanted me to be the designated point of contact, due to my experience within the NHS.\nOn Wednesday the 27th February I received a call at work from the hospital saying that my father was being discharged that afternoon and that my step mother had decided she would be the point of contact, which meant that she could not (or would not )discuss any further information with me.\nThis was very upsetting because being so far away from my father meant it was important for me to have up to date information regarding his condition etc., to allow for travel time from West Yorkshire to Chesterfield.\nI had to wait until I got home from work that evening to find out that my father had not been discharged due to Home oxygen not being sorted out. My eldest brother went to the hospital at 6. 30 pm to find my father sat on his bed, dressed but only wearing a t shirt, shivering with cold and barely able to string two words together, due to being taken off his oxygen all afternoon, his bags where packed, and he was waiting to go home. My brother had to inform him that he wasn't being discharged that day after all. He then had to get a nurse to get some fresh bedding and put my father back into bed. I cannot begin to imagine just how distressing this was for him.\nI was so upset that I rang the hospital the following morning from work to ask (complain about) what had happened, they didn't seem to know which code had been used to order the home Oxygen whether it be 4 hour urgent or 24 hours normal hospital discharge, but did admit that they had known from 5pm that he was not being discharged that day, so why had they not informed my father themselves and got him settled back into bed.\nI received a call from my brother at approx. 1. 30 pm to say my father was back at home settled into bed with his oxygen. I waited for my daughter to arrive back from America, whilst packing my bags in order to go stay with my father for the next 6 days and to organise a rota within the family to ensure that dad was never left alone. My husband was finishing work early to drive me to Chesterfield.\nAt approx. 4 pm I got another call from my youngest brother saying that dad was making strange gurgling noises and that he had called the doctor. I knew immediately what this meant and rang my daughter to get her to my dad ASAP, along with the rest of the family members.\nI then had to endure the worst two hour journey of my life fighting through tea time traffic to get to my dad's side.\nI arrived at approx. 6. 10 pm and dad passed away in my arms with me only managing to tell him I had arrived and that I loved him, I tried ring his GP but it was already out of hours and by the time someone from 111 had got back to us it was too late.\nDad's doctor arrived later and immediately apologised because he had not been informed by the hospital that dad was so ill and had assumed that with him being discharged that afternoon that he had probably picked up a chest infection.\nWe had to then go through the trauma of having to have a post mortem.\nMy problem is, why was no one around when my father was dying, where was the palliative care team, why did we not have a contact number for them, where was the Right to Care Plan, why had we not been issued with any DNAR form. What if my father had needed morphine and no one was around to administer any syringe drivers. Why was no one from any nursing team available? Dads GP had organised for their district nurse team to visit the next day, even his carers that must have been informed by the hospital that he was being sent home arrived on the Wednesday evening to be told that the discharge had been cancelled, and then they arrived to put dad to bed after he had passed away.\nI know that no one can be exact about when a person will die, but surely if my dad had been examined by a doctor before his discharge on the Thursday, why did we not get any indication that dad had deteriorated so badly.\nYou told me yourself on the 21st that dad was very ill and that we were looking at 4 months and that you did not feel the need to be calling everyone to his bedside at that time, but that you would have a better idea of how long after the anti-biotics had had time to work. (you said you would have more of an idea before my mother in laws funeral on the 26th) Obviously I was unavailable to talk to you again before this date, but that is why my daughter spoke to the ward sister on my behalf\nPlease can you look into all this and tell me what went wrong, because something clearly did, communication was definitely very poor.\nI also have a few other issues that need addressing regarding my dad's stay in hospital.\nI asked again on the Thursday and Friday about why the Mirtazapine had been stopped and still no one could give me an answer, which my dad's GP has said himself that he saw no reason why it should have been stopped he had checked my dad's blood results himself on ICE, I know being stopped so suddenly from 30 mg Mirtazipine would not have helped dad's frame of mind.\nOn the 23rd of February one of the patients in dad's bay was moved off the ward due to Norovirus, which I saw myself and was told by a member of the nursing team on the Sunday, yet my dad was left in the same bay when he was especially susceptible to infection.\nOn the 24th we had to point out to the nursing team that my dad's cannula had been left in place since the Tuesday evening 6 days, which again should not have been allowed, and was only moved when we pointed this out.\nWe also found out that one of the supplement drinks that he had been given by the hospital was almost 6 months out of date.\nDad was only every given his sleeping meds, Zopiclone whenever myself or my daughter where present to request it for him.\nYet again I have travelled 70miles to be told an absolute utter pile of rubbish by the hospital regarding these issues, even denying that the medication had been prescribed by their pharmacy. To say I am angry and upset is an understatement, and I am not prepared to leave it there and allow such failings to continue. This hospital underwent Care Quality Commissioning inspections in August 2012, they failed on 3 outcomes and these are all the same outcomes are all the same as the issues we had with my father's stay at the hospital, so clearly lessons have not been learned actions have not been put into place for improvements. I would advise anyone that has to stay at this hospital, please ask to be shown your medical records daily to check what is being actioned regarding your stay in hospital, insist on checking your medication records are accurate, and for any one that has someone admitted to this hospital with dementia or learning difficulties be alert, push the staff to take notice of your concerns and to not, like myself believe that the hospital only has the patients best interest at heart.", "We were very concerned to read about your and your mother's experiences at our hospital.

Our care under the midwives was faultless, and I absolutely loved being a first time mum. At 7 weeks I took our son to the doctor for his 6 week check (they made the late appointment, not me) and the doctor commented on a faint reddish mark on his cheek that was about the size of my smallest fingernail. I said I didn't know what specifically caused it, but that I thought he must have bumped his cheek when his Dad was cuddling him shortly before the appointment. Nothing more was mentioned. The rest of the check went fine and we went home. I mentioned the mark to my husband who said the baby had been trying to hold his head up and had bumped his cheek on the corner of his glasses. We didn't think anything more of it.\n\nA few hours later we got a phone call from the health visitor saying that the doctor was concerned about the mark and that we needed to take the baby immediately to the hospital where we would be met by social services and the police. It was absolutely the most traumatic, humiliating experience. My mum, who lives with my husband and I, came with us, and we reported to A&E where we met with a lady from social services. She looked at the baby and couldn't even see the mark, we had to point it out to her. Then a police constable arrived, and she also couldn't see the mark. They both expressed their surprise that we had been called to the hospital in this way. We were taken to a private room and questioned. A consultant came, and stripped the baby and examined him. He concluded that he was a well-cared for baby and his exact words told us that the mark is very small and could possibly be a bruise, but it isn't clear. He agreed that it was the same size as the corner of my husband's glasses. The lady from social services was unhappy that the doctor had not mentioned any concerns at our appointment earlier that day.\n\n    I understand that if doctors have concerns about abuse they need to be followed up. However she had stripped the baby naked during the examinaton and could see there was nothing else, and I don't know why she thought that, if I had hurt him on his face, I would have taken him to the doctors for the check up at all? ?\n\n    This experience completely knocked my confidence as a new first time mum. I was paranoid every time the baby scrammed himself with his fingers or his cup, and was so anxious about being judged that we ended up not going to many of the local mother and baby groups I had been looking forward to, and instead I paid to go elsewhere to private groups. We have been told that this is on our permanent record, even though the consultant and social services were satisfied that we hadn't done anything wrong. Other than that we had no follow up. At a subsequent visit the health visitor said that the doctor had been concerned that the baby was bruising without cause and had wanted him seen in case it was a medical condition - well if that was the case I don't think social services and the police would have turned up.\n\n    It has felt like for the last year the health visitor has been trying to justify reporting us to the police and social services back when the baby was 7 weeks. She makes constant comments about the baby being unhappy (he isn't) and underweight (he isn't). I was so badly frightened by the initial experience at 7 weeks that I didn't pull her up on her comments, and now they have progressed to things like Why are you sweating so much? (hot room as babies get stripped and weighed there), and Oh has your dad come with you today? Oh well he's quite slim so I suppose it's possible the baby will just be slim. '. At his 9 month development check she gave him two wooden blocks, and just as he started to play with them she wrenched them off him and said I should be more careful in case he put them in his mouth. He started to cry and wouldn't do any of the other things she asked him to (bang two toys together, play with a bead on a string). The other mums I have spoken to have said their 9 month old babies wouldn't do these things on request in a strange environment either. The HV grudgingly allowed the baby to pass the test, but insisted we have a 6 week nursery nurse 'intervention' to show me how to teach him to do things properly. When the nursery nurse came she said the baby was happy and was doing everything he's supposed to be doing, and more.\n\n    After the 'intervention' was cut short because it was not necessary, I have finally had enough. I am moving area and will be changing health visitors. I have been putting up with this for too long because I have been frightened that if I try and stand up for myself they will get social services involved again. It has basically been a nightmare from start to finish, but I have finally realised that I am a good mum, and that this has been the only major cause of stress over the whole of the first year with my son. These people are supposed to be one of the main sources of support for new mums - this feels like a joke.\n", "Thank you for your valuable feedback regarding your devastating experience. We hope you have now been able to meet with someone from PALs to be able to take this forward further.", "He was admitted at the end of April 2013 after being found on floor by my husband. It was obvious to us he had had a stroke. Was moved off admissions the following day onto ward c8. They had earlier diagnosed my dad with a water infections n pneumonia. He was very confused so mentioned it to staff who said if it doesn't improve he will go for a brain scan. This showed my dad had actually had a stroke. He was in this ward for 12 days and in all that time wad not seen once by anyone from the stroke team. I find this utter bewildering. \n\nNo doctor came to see me or my family to explain what had and was going to happen. I was told 3 times my dad was going to be moved to b2 but this never happened until the beginning of May when I threatened to put a complaint in. Lo and behold he was moved half an hour later. The stroke has left my dad incontinent, and unable to feed himself. \n\nHe weighed 60kg wen he first went in and now weighs 47. 3kg. He has been left in wet bedding, not been given the fluids he needs regularly. I could go on and on. By the way my dad is 90.", "I attended Gartnavel Royal Hospital in late May 2013 for my Pre-Assessment Appointment, the nurse who took me into the room could not have been any nicer.\nI was then informed to go to a ward to see a junior doctor who then sent me back down to the clinic which I was told to have an ECG. On arriving there the clerk of that department was rude and cheeky and was told this could not be carried out. I then went back up to the ward and told the junior doctor this and after she had seen me I was told to go back down that they would take me.\nOn my arrival back down at the pre-admission clinic I told the nurse (who was different ) to the one that carried out my assessment that I was told to have an ECG. This nurses attitude to me was disgraceful and told me exactly if I wasn't happy to make a complaint. She wasn't caring then she also accused me of being abusive to which I certainly was not, given there was no one to take my complaint I left the hospital without having my ECG. This nurses attitude was terrible and after her making the accusation I was abusive she then said go to hell", "I presented to the crisis unit with suicidal ideation having had long term depression. Basically I want to die every day and living is hell. I was seen after a 3 hour wait despite visibly and repeatedly breaking down in front of total strangers in reception. This was also despite 6 or 7 members of staff chatting merrily away in the reception office about social matters.\nEventually I was seen by an 'assessor' who spent 50 mins with me taking notes about how I felt like I wanted to kill myself. Finally he told me that my case would be discussed and assessed for treatment the following week. When I called the following week, I was told the meeting had to be cut short and it wasn't discussed but would definitely be the following week. When I called again, they again said they hadn't gotten round to it.\nI was now in full crisis having had a breakdown at work. Finally they called me to say that I wouldn't be offered treatment as I'd been offered treatment in the past and turned it down. I hadn't, and tried to tell them their records were wrong. I had to threaten to take it to the Chief Exec before they admitted their mistake and referred me to the Complex Care team. The earliest appointment they said they could give was 4 months away.\nIn that 4 months, I've lost my job, am about to lose my home. I finally had my appointment today which was yet another assessment (my 5th in total). I've been placed on a waiting list for therapy. I've been told it will be another 6 months.\nI don't know what to do. I don't know how to cope for 6 months. I'm so angry at the NHS. The Mental Health team at St Anne's are apparently set up for the benefit of the staff and not the patients. In my view, they have little or no understanding of mental health - for example, if you miss an appointment, they assume its because you no longer need treatment, not that your mental illness may prevent you leaving the house.\nThey've extinguished the little hope I had. But nothing will change because mental health patients aren't taken seriously even by the people who are supposed to help. I hope I survive this depression long enough to see to it that NHS Haringey is named and shamed for being the hellhole it is.\nNo wonder so many awful tragedies play out with these people. I feel that they are a disgrace to their profession", "Went to increase Vitamin D levels.\nI was furious when yesterday my GP rang and informed me that they had been giving me too large a dose of Cholecalciferol.

She seemed to have little understanding of what I had experienced and which had left me traumatised. She seemed to think she knew better than the experienced psychiatrists and psychologists I had seen and from whom I had reports. There has been a lot that has gone on for me before going for this counselling and I really did not feel this was properly understood or dealt with. I do not think they understood the severe depression I have suffered and still suffer to this day due to what happened to me. a\nI was treated as if I was very young and inexperienced. I had to tell her that I was an educated woman in her fifties and that I did not deserve to be treated in the way she was treating me. She kept focusing on setting goals \u2013 I felt this was inappropriate as I needed other help and support before setting goals. She gave me a slip of paper to take home and read. One of the questions on this were inappropriate for my condition \u2013 eg did I feel guilt after consuming any quantity of alcohol. These were questions more appropriate to an addict and I pointed this out to her. What I needed was cognitive therapy not this form of counselling.\nI felt the counsellor did not have enough experience or maturity. I felt that she was quite rude and self opinionated I told here I did not feel I was being helped by her and on leaving the room in a very distressed and stressed state. (She just stated in a sarcastict manner) Bye then\nI walked out of the session I stated I wished to see the manager the counsellor stated I could not and that I had to put it in writing any complaint and just pushed me out in to the public reception area. The receptionist saw I was very distressed crying and shaking she sat me down and gave me a cup of water I told her what had happened with the counsellor. The receptionist stated I was not in a good state to leave I asked, could I see the manager and the Manager became involved. I explained how I felt during my session with the young counsellor and why, but did not receive any acknowledgement of this or an apology from her. The Manager said she needed to get away to a meeting she just asked what it was I wanted from them, this I found made me further depressed and unhappy as again I felt no empathy from this lady also, she just kept looking at the clock, I felt she wanted to go to lunch as when I went out into the public reception I stopped to thank the receptionist and the manager was leaving with a colleague it looked to me as if, they were going to lunch together. Iit seemed that she was not prepared to make time for me even though I was feeling very upset crying and shaking due to the experience I had just suffered.\nThe receptionist who witnessed all of this was the only one who expressed any support or empathy. She got me a glass of water and waited while I was able to calm down. During this time I saw the Manager leave the building \u2013 I didn't get the impression she was off to a meeting.\nAs I left the building a little while later I saw the young counsellor returning from lunch with another young colleague. They both saw me and started to snigger \u2013 I felt that this was a real sign that confidentiality had been breached. I got home and rang Inclusion Matters to speak to the manager about this. Again there was no hint of an apology.\nThese people are dealing with vulnerable people but don't seem to understand this.\nNone of my contacts with Inclusion Matters has been good! I was not able to make my initial appointment and phoned them to rearrange it. The girl I spoke to just kept saying that If I did not make it to the next appointment I would be struck off! This was also continuously said by the Counsellor at each appointment which caused me more distress. I was also upset to see that on each visit you were made to fill out the same forms in the public area answering the same questions this took time away from the 45 minuites you were given. I refused to answer any more questions on a continuous basis on my drinking pattern each visit and stated, I was not attending due to my having a drinking problem. I was also told when I stated this that they do not counsell addidcts yet they asked the questions regarding on each visit.\nI have been offered further sessions in a different location but again, on taking a call from a gentleman who sounds very young I feel I am not happy to sit and talk about what has happened to cause my illness with a young male. I have been unable to attend due to hospital commitments on the Tuesdays yet, they do not seem to want to change the days to an alternative day instead of on a Tuesday.\nI have now two major concerns, firstly I do not feel like the issues about my treatment so far have been addressed and I am also worried about carrying on with this service. I am not sure they have the right people to understand and address my needs but I still feel very vulnerable and my GP and others remain concerned about how I am. I am not happy to carry on with this service as I am not happy to be councelled by a young male. I have experienced a greater amount of stress and depression since attending the Inclusion Matters Programme. What happened to me was very serious and truamatic and has left long lasting implications on my life and health. I do not feel Inclusion Matteers has helped me deal with this in anyway and has shown little or no empathy not to mention confidentiality in regard to myself.\n ", "Thank you for sending in the feedback about our service.

It was my second c-section and I lost a lot of blood, felt dizzy and quite unwell in the following few days. The room I was in had 3 others, all who had had c-sections. The treatment we received was very poor (with the exception of one young member of staff who cared). We were treated like inconveniences, we were scared to press our buttons and were constantly told they were too busy. \nOn one occasion, a mum who was upset in pain and struggling to change her babies nappy asked for help, she was told they were too busy and she should do it herself. My husband then saw the nursing staff sitting sharing out malteesers. On another occasion, at 11pm, a member of staff took my temperature then walked out. I called to her to ask why and she said (while walking off), you may have internal bleeding. \nI was left, alone, scared and in pain, not knowing what the outcome would be.

A friend suggested as I had private medical insurance I should have it corrected. I went on line and found a consultant who was at Moorfields and also practised privately. This consultant said they could see scarring and performed a YAG laser capsulotomy. As I was sitting in position for this procedure, they mentioned seemingly casually there was a small percentage of these procedures ending in blindness. They did not intimate that what they were about to do not only might not work but could result in a posterior vitreous detachment. This is exactly what happened. I still have the original puffiness plus a vitreous detachment. It swirls about in my eye like a smeary curtain and I am now unable to drive at night and have to dim my lights at home.

I was sent home to sleep even though I know realise that this is very dangerous especially since I was going home to my university flat alone. \nI returned on in early November at 10: 30 to have my head stitched.

You need to return to your gp for more \"x\" medication\" and they disregarded the fact the medication was the same I'd already been on for a month, that hadn't worked and due to prolonged blood loss of 4 weeks the gp had referred me to them.\nAll in all I was distressed and disgusted at the gynae departments attitude of quote \"it's normal to bleed heavily and pass clots for a month after a baby\" despite explanations that I had a baby 3. 5 months ago and hadn't had any previous post partum issues. I left the department crying hysterically, and attended epsom A&E who were shocked at the treatment I received. I shall be making a formal complaint.", "My wife suffers from dementia, and there have been problems with her air bed. I rang Locala to have a look and they believed it to be a faulty pump.\nA new pump for the bed was brought last week and was fitted, but the mattress was still not blowing up.\nI rang Locala again and asked for an engineer to visit and try to sort out the problem. They said maybe it was the mattress.\nWhen the engineer arrived, he had only brought a mattress with him. In order for them to look at the problem, I had to move my wife from the bed. It took three of us to move her. We had to move her on to a decorator's paste table whilst we waited.\nThe engineer took an hour and a half to fit the new mattress, during which time my wife was still on the paste table which was extremely uncomfortable. The three of us who had to help my wife move also had to wait around for this time. In the end, the engineer realised it was a faulty pump (I had told them this).\nI am considering making a complaint because of this mistake which resulted in my wife waiting for an hour and a half in an uncomfortable position.", "Dear Very unwell\r\nI am really sorry to hear about your experience, this is certainly not the standard of care that we usually provide through the gynaecology service.

I asked to be discharged due to not being on a mental health section\n", "Our father had mixed but generally very good care from doctors at Derriford Hospital since he was diagnosed with chronic renal failure nearly a quarter of a century ago. This included the thorough treatment he received prior to and following a successful Kidney Transplant in 1994. Also it is only proper to reflect positively on the care and attention he received from the many renal nurses and other care assistants/nurses who tended to him over the course of his many visits to hospital, all of whom he held in high regard.\nMost recently he had a different experience. He was very frustrated and disappointed and had become quite upset and disillusioned about the lack of care and lack of treatment and lack of information he was given following his admission to Derriford Hospital after a fall at home in late January 2013. This included him being discharged briefly for a week in late February and in my opinion ultimately led to his untimely death in late March 2013.\nOur father's sense of frustration had grown as he had been explaining since last summer to doctors about feeling extreme fatigue and a complete lack of energy and this had left him feeling light headed and weak. This symptom had only materialised after he had begun Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis at home. After beginning CAPD, he seemed to feel as if he was being left to his own devices and when he complained of fatigue and having no energy, he was told simplistically to exercise more. His complete lack of energy and weariness was what eventually led in late January to him falling at home as he lost consciousness whilst trying to make a cup of tea.\nIn my opinion Doctor A did not treat our father properly initially after his admission in late January. This included giving him a 6 day course of antibiotics (which seems surprisingly brief) for pneumonia on the left lung and then authorising his premature discharge in late February. Doctor A ignored our Fathers plea to examine his left lung pain and shortness of breath down to the diagnosis of two displaced ribs on the left side. It felt that our father's treatment was chaotic and dangerous seemingly due to failure of the Doctor A's lack of clear communication. Our father was often left dehydrated, with bleeding limbs due to apparent negligence and poor man handling from some doctors. Our Father only was addressed properly and informed of the current \u201ctrial treatment\u201d when I took his doctors to task on their lack of professionalism and compassion towards my Father's well being and recovery. Myself, my brother and our Father felt that we were never fully informed of our Father's treatment or reason for it, only that they were doing everything they could. However I do beg to differ on this point as within our Fathers last 24 hours numerous doctors from different departments were asked to see our Father to run numerous tests ie bone marrow samples. We do not understand why these tests had not been run earlier, particularly as it fuelled our family with false hope as the test results would take 7 days to return.\nSadly after his readmission due to breathing difficulties, the doctors we met on Mayflower Ward themselves seemed without much idea generally. Our father was particularly frustrated with Doctor B who he said was aloof and uncommunicative. When we observed Doctor B during his ward rounds a few days before my father died, he seemed quite unperturbed by our father's clearly worsening condition and claimed to be treating his chest infection \u2018empirically' on what proved to be less than 48 hours before his death.\nWe feel that our father was treated poorly during what proved to be his last visit to Derriford Hospital, and our experiences since his death have apparently confirmed the shoddy approach of some of the staff. We have both tried to liaise with the bereavement team at Derriford Hospital after our initial meeting with them the day after our father died, at which we gave permission for an autopsy to be completed. We gave our consent for a post mortem examination and sample to be taken on the understanding this would determine what had caused the chest infection and inform the doctors prior to our meeting with them to discuss those results. The doctors themselves wanted to know what had caused our father's death as they did not seem to know.\nFive months have now elapsed since we gave our consent for this procedure and we have not had information. We feel like we have been deliberately ignored and our attempts to ascertain what has happened are being frustrated, and we are left wondering why this is the case? We have sent in a complaint letter but the due date that the hospital set themselves to get back to us has expired. This seems to us not only unprofessional and to demonstrate a lack of care and thought for grieving relatives, but also seems symptomatic of the directionless treatment we believe our father received. It would seem at best to indicate an organisation that is incompetent and totally dysfunctional and is deeply troubling.\nThe bereavement team have not kept us informed about what has happened. We have requested a meeting with Doctor B so we can discuss the results from the autopsy together but have heard nothing. It was only the intervention of the Critical Care Team, who arrived on Mayflower Ward to accompany our father for an Xray who intervened and stopped what we regarded as being inhumane treatment. A junior doctor had the decency to apologise for this when we went to the hospital the day after our father died. This well meaning but inadequate response is all we have received by way of an explanation.", "Thank you for your feedback - you may already be engaged with staff at this Trust regarding your concerns and please be assured these will be fully investigated.

She received no treatment except pain killers.\nTwo days later it was decided she should be transferred to Huddersfield RI for an MRI scan the following morning, the doctor also stated she should receive morphine to relieve the pain. She was put in ward 18 at HRI. When the medicine was being given later we asked ref to Morphine as the doc had said. The nurses said as he had not written in down they cannot administer it, leaving my 7 year old in awful pain.\nEventually the following day she was given Morphine (some 84 hrs after been admitted) I feel this was not acceptable.\nShe was finally given a MRI scan at 5pm on the fifth day.  This proved inconclusive as it had not been done right. The MRI dept staff we came into contact with were very uncaring as my daughters knee was locked in an awkward position but they just pulled her leg and said she should have been given pain killers before coming down.  I think this is very uncaring for a little girl in bad pain.\nThe following day another MRI scan was done which showed damaged cartilage and meniscus damage. She was then transferred back to Calderdale Royal to have an operation the following day. During all the time she was in HRI my daughter had received deep bed sores, I believe the fact she wet the bed and was left in it with wet sheets for ages didn't help. The nurses at Calderdale Royal were appalled at the degree of these bed sores and arranged for pictures to be taken, saying this should never happen and she should have been put on an air bed. My daughter had the op and so far all seems ok with the exception we have now found out that the knee was only washed out and the meniscus and cartilage not touched. We were also informed my daughter should go for physio @ Broad St, Halifax. This was never arranged.\nShe now has problems with her other knee. We called 111 and an appointment was made at Calderdale Royal care direct. The doctor there saw Lucy and said we had done the correct thing bringing her in as she clearly cannot carry on like this in pain and unable to walk. The doctor rang Huddersfield RI (I was in the room when this was done) and made an appointment to see an Orthopaedic doctor at Huddersfield. So off we went with a letter for the Ortho doctor from the care direct doctor.\nWhen we arrived at Huddersfield we were informed no appointment had been made (I heard it being made) We were told we would have to go through A&E if we wanted to see a doctor. We waited 3-4 hours to do this and finally we were seen by 2 doctors, we went for an xray which was clear. The doctor we saw told us my daughter would need to be admitted to the ward and have a MRI scan on the Monday.\nWe informed the doctor as my daughter suffered the deep bed sores at the hopsital we would prefer her not to stay and we could bring her back fro the MRI. He made a few phone calls and said that would be ok and we were booked in for an MRI scan. I again asked the doctor if she will def be scanned on Monday because if not we would allow her to be admitted to the ward if that was what was needed.  The doctor assured me that the scan with the MRI dept was booked and that we will be phoned either Sunday or Mon with a time. The doctor also stated if we had not been rung by midday Mon we should ring back.\nOn Mon we rang as we had not been called only then to be told by the MRI dept that a scan had not been booked wasting myself taking a day off work.\nNow were are being told another doctor needs to see my daughter before any scan is done but due to holidays cannot see her until mid August ..\nI feel the first doctor lied to us and neglected the well being of our child, I double checked regarding the scan and was assured that one had been booked, which was clearly not the case.\nIn the mean time my daughter cannot straighten her knee and is unable to walk unaided, we have had to go to Calderdale royal and pick up some crutches as HRI A&E dept informed us they cannot give them to 7 year olds in case they fall over....so if she falls over without them its ok?\nAs we are due to go on holiday so I have asked for a medical certificate for my insurance, the hospital are refusing to give one until my daughter has been seen by a doctor in mid Aug.. even though she has been seen by a number of A&E doctors who wanted to admit her again..\nI'm looking at going down the legal route now as this has just got beyond belief in the meantime my daughter is still suffering and all we are getting told bring her to A&E which we already have done.\nWe cannot leave her at her normal out of school club and child minders as she cannot get about, but the NHS don't seem to give a damn about that, ,\nI have been in contact with CQC and also my local newspaper who is so appalled by this has passed it on to a national paper.\nMy priority is my daughters health and getting her right.\nI spoke with the doctor's secretary who stated they would go and book my daughter an MRI scan (another lie as we are informed secretarys cannot do this) and also find out what's been going on and ring me back. Well they never rang back but a Sister did telling me that they would not do a scan until the doctor had seen my daughter and this couldn't be done till mid August due to holidays. I stated this was not acceptable and leaving my daughter in pain that long is neglect. I informed them that I would get the MRI scan done privately to which I was told I couldn't as I didn't what scan needed to be done. I asked  to get this information for me then to which I was told I would be wasting my time and money. I asked if another consultant could see my daughter and was told they couldn't do that for me.\nI asked if they thought it was ok for my daughter to remain in pain unable to walk for 9 days until the doctor returned from holiday.   Again the response shocked me and was asked if I wanted the appointment in mid August or not.\nI said I wanted my daughter treated, and asked why do we have to wait to see a particular doctor before we can have a scan when another had informed us she needed one and even said that one had been booked?\nI feel this is total neglect of a 7 year old child, especially when I have even offered to go private for the MRI scan to speed up the process,\nSorry but just not acceptable.", "If you are having difficulty accessing GP care, you may want to talk to to Clinical Commissioning Group for your area.

My GP diagnosed acute appendicitis (a clear diagnosis) and I was admitted to the Royal Hospital Calow Chesterfield as an emergency the next day.\nComplaint 1:\nI was not visited by a doctor for assessment immediately. it was the evening before I was assessed in the Emergency Admissions Ward. although the symptoms I described to the Doctor were classic apendicitis, he told me he believed it to be diverticulitis.\nComplaint 2:\nI was sent for an X-ray in the evening. I was given no feedback or results from this X-ray. I was then moved to Barnes Ward, bay 3.\nComplaint 3:\nI was told I would be sent for a scan. However, they told me that there was a backlog and the scan didn't take place until three days later. They confirmed at this stage that the appendicitis had now ruptured and leaking puss; that had it not ruptured, it could be removed but that this now could not be operated on because it had now ruptured. Bearing in mind I had been there for 48 hours, and the morphine did not touch the pain, I feel this delay was unacceptable. I also believe that had the scan happened straight away, it would not have ruptured. I feel the hospital has been negligent in this respect.\nComplaint 4:\nI told the nurse when I was admitted on that I had pain in my neck (I have spondilitis) and asked for some pain relief. I asked specifically for topical ibuprofen; this is how I usually manage my own pain. I was in such acute and unbearable pain, I felt the need to pace around the ward, causing further pain in my abdomen.\nMy daughter visited on Thursday evening and asked a nurse why this had not yet been provided over 24 hours after arrival. She was told this couldn't now be collected from the pharmacy because it had closed. My daughter let them know she was unhappy to hear of this poor patient care and said that had she been told, she would have provided this herself, which she did. I was very grateful she did, because it took the nurses 48 hours to provide this. \n\nComplaint 5:\nOn Saturday evening, I was seen by a doctor who told me that in all likelihood, I would be sent home on Monday. I questioned the wisdom of this considering I have a ruptured appendix and there is a high risk of serious infection. Although I understand that I have to be treated with antibiotics so that the infection can sufficiently reduce so that an operation can be done safely, I consider the hospital to be the safest place for me to be. The doctor said that my white blood count was encouraging, so I told the doctor I wanted to stay in hospital and have the appendix removed as quickly as possible.", "I write this letter as I feel I have been treated appallingly by Queens's hospital and would like some answers at why I was treated this way and why my situation seemed to be dismissed until it came to a near fatal stage.\nI would like to start by saying. I am extremely good when it comes to pain as a 31 year old that has experienced Kidney stones from the age of 13, Gall stones, gall bladder infection and numerous operations in my years. So I know when something is not right and I know when something is very painful, the only time I visit A&E is when I feel there is complete need to. I am very used to these sorts of bad pain and just get on with things. It takes a lot to grind me to a halt like this has.\n\nDay One Last suspected period date 5 Weeks prior, Clear blue pregnancy test showed 2-3 weeks pregnant. I did a test as I knew something wasn't right. I had been passing brown blood for 9 days starting from the day after my period was due and I had a lot of pain in my side which I put down to kidney stones for a week prior to taking the test.\n\nNext Day  The pains had got a lot worse overnight so I took myself to A&E as again I knew something just wasn't right. I was given a urine test and was referred to the Early Pregnancy Unit at triage without any explanation as to what might be happening. On arrival at the unit I had a blood test and whilst talking to the doctor I got a very sharp stabbing pain again which made me have to stop talking and double up. I explained to the doctor this was in the same category as Kidney stone pain (as I have suffered with stones for many years). The doctor looked at me holding my side and said the pain is in the wrong place to be ectopic. I then had an internal scan which showed nothing and the doctor said that she would note it as a non-location pregnancy for today as it was possibly too early to see anything on a scan but to go back 48 hours late for another blood test to see if HCG levels had increased.\n\nDay 4 Second blood test marked as urgent and I was told I would get a call with the results tomorrow evening.\nDay 5  HCG levels up  Scan booked for 3 days later.\n\nDay 8 Still bleeding and still have pains. Another Internal scan done and again nothing could be seen. I was told that so far everything pointed in the direction of a healthy pregnancy and it may still be too early to see anything. Another blood test was taken. later that day  I got a phone call saying my HCG levels were up again and I was being referred to a consultant.\n\nDay 11 Consultant. Pain is still persistent. I had a tightening feeling in my stomach. Another internal scan done, still showing nothing. Booked another blood test for Day 15 and the next day.\n\nDay 12 . Extremely bad pain, Unable to stand up shaking from head to toe. I called early pregnancy unit and they told me to go straight there. I got to the hospital at 12. 30pm. At 4. 30pm! ! ! I was finally taken notice of and given co-drydamol which I was very surprised about as this is a strong painkiller and I was pregnant. The painkillers did ease the pain off enough for me to at least sit up straight. I was called in to see the doctor who said if the pain has eased you can go home.  I was shocked, my reply to this was so you are not going to examine me then or scan me I had already explained that I was due to be scanned in 4 days' time. They told me there was no point scanning me as I was having another one soon and they were no good at scanning anyway so it's not worth it.  I insisted on being examined at least by hand. He said I can but if it was ectopic you wouldn't have walked in here he then half-heartedly examined my stomach by hand and told me to go home as everything was fine.\n\nBy 5. 30pm  I was at home and my pain had become very severe. The worst it has been. I was crying in agony but could not go back to the hospital to be left in agony for 4 hours, uncomfortable and sent home again. I was very upset at how I had been treated. By 6pm I felt extremely ill and was vomiting. I went to the toilet and passed a clot which was very thick and very dark red/brown colour of about 1 \u00bd inches in size. After this the pain started to wear off. I thought that was it that I had miscarried my baby.\n\nI was shocked that I was made to wait 4 hours without being acknowledged as the ward was well aware of my case as I had been there quite a lot over the last couple of weeks yet my notes were never retrieved. I felt this mistake of sending me home could have proved Fatal as I was to find out.\n\nDay 15  Went for a blood test. HCG Levels were up again . I was told that tomorrow if nothing could be seen on the scan I would be given the methotrexate injection tomorrow.\n\nDay 16   Another internal scan this time with the consultant, and 2 others present. I was scanned. The fetus was found in my right Fallopian tube. On finding this the consultant put his hands on his head and said oh no and started shaking his head. I told him I was at the hospital in severe pain on the previous Friday and they said I should never of been sent home and should have been examined. I was now too late for the methotrexate injection and I was told I was to come back at 7am for emergency surgery as they needed to remove the fetus and my tube which was very enlarged. I was told this would just be a day case and I would be home by late afternoon. I went home that night devastated as I had been enduring pain and emotional stress for 3 weeks before it come to this even though I stated from day 1 that I was in an incredible amount of pain.\n\nDay 17 I arrived at 7am. I was given a form which asked if I wanted the hospital to incinerate the baby or I wanted it to be held to have a funeral. I took the form to sign and the lady that gave it to me looked at my notes and said Oh you don't need that form as it's not a miscarriage and then she took it away. My Mum come to wait with me and was waiting on the day unit until I returned from surgery. The operation was to take approximately 1 hour. I got taken down at and was wheeled in to theater half an hour later. 3 hours later I was told they were waiting for a bed to become available on the ward then I would be taken and kept in overnight. I then thought about my mum still waiting for me at the day surgery cubicle. I have been told by my mum and husband that no one knew what was happening with me after 3 hours they were not sure if I was still in theatre at was ill or had come out. My mum had tried asking but nobody knew where I was. My husband called the day unit 3 times after waiting 3 hours and was told on the 3rd time I was being kept in. My husband then contacted my mum who was still sitting by an empty bed awaiting her daughters return. \n\nAt 5pm I was taken to Corn Flower B ward where my mum, dad and husband were waiting for me. The next point of this letter is extremely hard to write. As I turned my head on my pillow I realized there was a specimen bottle next to my head. I picked it up thinking it must have been a urine sample and was going to place it on the table as I didn't want my sample next to my head. I looked in the bottle where I was to find my removed fallopian tube with my baby clearly visible to me stuck in the tube. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. There in front of my eyes was the baby that had just been taken away from me. You could clearly see it was a baby and it looked exactly like a 1st scan picture in real life. I was completely devastated. As were my family who couldn't quite believe it. My mum went and gave this back to a nurse and was apologized to.\nThe following day, a consultant come round to see me and apologized for the mistake that was made of the baby being left at my head. This just showed me what a huge mistake had been made as this is the 1st time I had seen this consultant and hadn't mentioned it. I was also told the tube had been leaking and was close to rupture before it was removed. Surely this should have been picked up on the Friday before when I came in as an emergency. If only they  had scanned me. The mistake of not looking at me further could have proved fatal for me.\n\nA nurse whose name is Lynn from the ward who I saw originally and she referred me to the consultant came to see me whilst I was in hospital as she see my name on a board and wanted to know how I was and what had happened. She couldn't believe I was sent home on the Friday and why did no one look at my notes. I had no answers for this. Lynn was brilliant to me during my time going through this trauma.\n\nBack home my mental health started to suffer. Every time I closed my eyes I could see the baby in the tube in a jar and started having a dream that they put the baby there next to me to keep it alive and I would soon be able to hold my baby. I was crying all the time and not sleeping at all. I carried on having the same dream every time I did try to nod off. Every time I closed my eyes I could see it. I started to become ill through stress and not sleeping. I was not talking or wanting to see anyone. On Day 31 I was still sobbing constantly and still having the same dream and not sleeping, I couldn't concentrate I couldn't watch the TV or read a book, I was literally staring into space, because of this. I made a doctor's appointment. The doctor prescribed sedatives and said if I feel no better in a few weeks come back and I will be referred for counselling. I started to sleep while still having the dream every night and being woken by it, at least I was getting 2-3 hours' sleep a night. I am still at the date of this letter mentally I am still finding day to day life hard to contend with. I came back to work on Day 45 to try and get a bit of normality back and to help my recovery. I seem to be sitting crying at my computer more than working. I think counseling is going to be the only way I can deal with the terrible thing that has happened. I do have an appointment with the nurse at my doctors as I have been told by my hairdresser how has 26 years' experience that I have the beginnings of alopecia caused by stress.", "Dear Sadperson\r\nI am so very sorry to read about the loss of your baby.

Despite me telling the nursing staff that he needed assistance with self care including washing and shaving he was left to shower on his own and the seat in the shower where he was left to shower on was marked \"broken -do not use\". he was left on the ward unshaved and I personally witnessed soiled hospital gowns sitting on a radiator for two days - so much for hospital cleanliness and their aim to reduce hospital acquired infections, and yes I have taken pictures to prove my point! !", "Thank you for your posting, I was very sorry to read that your relative's experience was as poor as you have recoubted here, and this is certainly something we want to follow up on your behalf.\r\nWe would like to investigate this further, if you are able to provide me with some further details we can look into the circumstances in more detail.

I was led to believe by the surgeon that the surgery was very minor and I would regain consciousness quickly and be out of hospital that day.\nThis was not the case!\nDuring my time after the operation I was left in the recovery room/ward (i'm not sure where or what this is) I lost 6 units of blood. What I don't understand is why after more than 2 hours of being in that room why nobody noticed I had lost all this blood and because of this was unconscious for a further 5 days. The doctor who delivered my operation and staff in that ward surely should have been checking my blood pressure and if I was bleeding from where the operation took place on my body? This is a lot of blood as i'm sure you will agree and because of this I was then on a life support machine for 4 days in intensive care and my wife was told by a friend of the family who worked at the hospital it was best for everyone to get up to the hospital. AKA I don't think your husband has long left! A nurse who worked in intensive care kept saying to my wife \u201che's a poor soul\u201d.  What information is that for my wife who was in bits and wanted to know why her husband who was meant to be in for a routine small piece of surgery was now critically ill.\nAnother thing I don't understand is why the doctor who performed my operation left for the night after my operation and did not check on me, my wife asked to speak to the doctor that night after and she was informed he was away for the night- surely it is your duty as a doctor to check on your patient before you leave for the night so you are in the utmost confidence you have done your job correctly? My wife was then told later that night, another doctor would be stopping the bleeding and transfused 6 units of blood, which because of this man I am alive today! Why did the doctor who performed the operation not do this?\nI then took pneumonia whilst in intensive care. Again something which I feel did not need to happen if the doctor had followed up with his patient and saw I was losing a lot of blood.\nWhen my wife would visit the hospital every waking minute she could, and was told every time she came up \u201che's just the same\u201d\u2026how is that giving my wife any information? She was in complete shock and all she ever heard was the night this happened to me she got sat down and got asked what do you want to happen? That was a no brainer! I was then transferred to another ward for 4 days and discharged where the nurses or doctors on that ward let me walk down to the front door and stand myself waiting on my wife and son picking me up. I would like to know why this happened. Surely after losing all that bloody, nearly being at deaths door somebody should have taken me down to the front door and waited with me.\nI am a tall sturdy man and left that hospital 2 stone lighter. I was a very fit man and enjoyed gardening, I now can't do this due to lack of strength. I now wake up during the night having terrible dreams of dying and for about a year after my operation I could hardly sleep because I was scared I wouldn't wake up.

I was given an off hand diagnosis by Psychiatric Nurse on my first ever visit - after speaking with him for thirty minutes - I didn't get out of bed for two weeks following this.

The post natal care, in my case, seemed to be non existent. I would rather give birth in the street than in that hospital again. \nI went into the ward in late morning and after 6 hours of contractions, I was bleeding quite heavily and severely vomiting. I was examined and told it was normal and to go home. Little did I know the midwife had missed vital signs that mine and my baby's lives were in danger. \nI returned to the hospital as I was in severe pain between contractions and bleeding even heavier. I was taken into a room with blood all over the floor, not a great start. I was examined and told everything was normal - however my baby's heartbeat was causing concern. It was monitored and then another midwife decided the monitor was picking up my heartbeat not the baby's. Oh how wrong, was she?\nI rapidly deteriorated but no one would help. The midwife was ignoring my pleas for help and didn't seem to know where any equipment was. Still vomiting and bleeding even heavier, I was asked if I could walk down to the delivery suite. \nEventually in the late evening, I was seen by a Dr who was so concerned that my baby's heartbeat was over 170, they pulled someone out of theatre and rushed me in. \nI was severely dehydrated and had a blood loss of over 2 litres. My baby's heartbeat dropped to below 40 and the situation had become critical.\nHad they listened to me 4 hours ago maybe my placenta wouldn't have abrupted and caused the blood loss and stress to my baby. \nAfter the c section, I was wheeled back to the delivery suite to be greeted by a midwife seemingly demanding I breastfeed my baby. I had been pumped full of drugs and suffered extreme dehydration, couldn't move and was barely able to talk.\nShe continually put pressure on me and refused to help me bottle feed my baby. This was the start of things to come. \nThe only pleasant midwives, in my experience, were the students. I discharged myself within 48 hours due to the poor treatment I received. \nTo name a few issues, I was shouted at, prescribed medication unsuitable for someone with Asthma and refused different pain relief for 36 hours, given a blood pressure test on an arm with a drip in it which exploded, stabbed in the arm with an injection with such force it instantly bruised, not shown where any facilities were, not given water as I was on a drip and apparently didn't need any more fluid.\nThe staff continually walked in my room without introducing themselves or explaining what they were there to do. I witnessed a midwife shout at another member of staff across my room and then she proceeded to speak badly of her in front of me. At no point was I shown how to change, dress or feed my baby. \nI could write so much more about my experience, but the bottom line is in my opinion people should not use the maternity services at this hospital. ", "A catastrophic chain of events led to my mother being unsafe at home and extremely depressed and unhappy. My mother was let down by a locally based domiciliary care agency who did not turn up at the designated times leaving my mother saturated in her own urine and very distressed.  When she contacted the call centre by pressing her alarm, she was attended by the local community support officer, the ambulance service and district nurse, all of whom expressed grave concerns about her personal welfare. As her daughter, I felt that I had an overwhelming duty of care to ensure that she was placed safely in familiar and welcoming surroundings.\nShrublands in the first instance provided respite care for her. When she was ready to return home, she was then presented with a satisfactory option of returning to Shrublands as a day client with wrap around care provided by Oxford Private Care. \nPlease note that it would benefit many other clients in need of help if you could publish this positive story. Asking for help does work.\n", "My daughter ( age 14 ) has a heart condition called Tetralogy of Fallots, a congenital heart defect that requires surgery soon after birth. She received two open heart surgeries, the final one being the repair. It is common knowledge amongst all medical professionals that fallots childrens need ongoing follow up cardiac care, as they will need further surgery later into adolescence/adulthood. They are also at risk of sudden death and arrhythmia. \nWe moved from the Highlands to Kent in the last 18 months, and 6 months ago my daughter for the first time started showing odd symptoms over a period of time. They were cumulative and one of the symptoms which concerned me was a discoloration around her mouth. It was grey/blue and although she didn't realise when it was happening, I felt that it was related to her heart condition. Other symptoms were swollen ankles, and fatigue, and so I decided it was time to go to the GP. We went three times in total and asked for a referral and despite knowing her heart condition, knowing that she would indeed need more surgery at some point, he said I was overreacting, and refused to refer me. \nI returned home quite at a loss, My daughter's symptoms were increasing and out of desperation I took her to A& E feeling sure that a registrar or someone would see that it was a dangerous game the GP was playing by not referring her. \nOn arrival, I described my daughter's symptoms, they commented on her swollen ankles in what seemed to be almost a laughing 'look at the size of them' way, gave her an ECG and in total I was seen by three registrars of different specialties. She was even taken up to the childrens ward for a couple of hours to see other medical staff. They told me they could hear a murmur and her ECG wasn't totally normal but they felt it safe to assume that this was all probably typical of a child with her disease. They didn't refer her to a cardiologist, told me nothing was wrong and discharged her.\nThe next morning I am in panic mode, that feeling when you know your child, you know something is dreadfully wrong, and the only people you can turn to have decided to take no notice. So a tearful me telephoned the secretary of the Paediatric Cardiac Surgeon who performed life saving open heart surgery on my daughter as a baby, and told her the events, my fears, and whether I could 'self refer' and get down to Bristol to have her looked at. She agreed immediately, and two weeks later I am travelling with my sick child across England to Bristol Childrens Hospital, and into the Cardiac Unit. \nMy daughter was reunited with her Cardiologist, and Surgeon. They performed an echocardiogram and an MRI. We discovered that the murmur that the staff I met at QEQM decided was harmless, the swollen ankles they seemingly laughed at, the abnormal ECG that they felt was 'probably to be expected' was actually severe right ventricular dilatation, with Pulmonary Valve incompetence. So severe were these two things, that she is having open heart surgery in 3 weeks time. She is on complete rest as her body can no longer cope with any exertion. The swollen ankles is pulmonary edema (water gathering around her heart and lungs) and her right ventricle is in heart failure. The dilatation of the right ventricle is now compromising the left pumping chamber as the right fills up with regurgitated blood from the leaking pulmonary valve. The tiredness, well, that one is obvious. .\nAs a non medical professional, I would like to think that if a child is brought in who is symptomatic, and has a well known serious heart disease, the time for apparently guessing a diagnosis is definitely not that time.\nHad I not called the Surgeon and Cardiac unit, I would be sat here now, with a very good chance that my daughter would have either have died from a heart fibrillation or sudden death. \nNow can someone please tell me where the doctors I met at QEQM trained? It seemed not one of them could speak english competently and clearly. Not one of them could understand that if you hear a heart murmur and see an abnormal ECG on a patient with a congenital heart defect who is symptomatic, that this is not normal and advice from a heart specialist should be sought in the first instance.\nThis is scary stuff and it makes me wonder how many other children could have been misdiagnosed in similar circumstances. I really need and intend to get answers, I can assure you.\nI am so angry.", "I am so sorry to read about this terrible situation that you and your daughter have been through.

She eventually had more X-rays of her hips and chest. We were told she would have her bloods done.

I found when I called the hospital in labour they were very helpful and ready for me when I arrived to give birth. I was in active labour so they did what the could to make my experience the best they could. The midwife that delivered my daughter was a brunette who I think was called Vicky. She was very bubbly and made my experience a lovely one despite having an episiotomy and my daughters heart rate dropping. She even asked for my daughters name to write in her book and when I was admitted to their ward in my second pregnancy she remembered us as came to see my daughter I give her a 10/10. \nMy second birth experience was also at the Manor so I was delighted to have the chance to Return to this hospital. However my second experience was nothing like the first. \nI find their antenatal clinic and staff were excellent but when I started suffering quite badly from Symphysis Pubis Dysfunction (SPD) I had to use their triage department. I felt the staff there were very rude to me and basically tried to send me home before properly even checking me over. I was in so much pain to the point I was light headed. They checked my blood pressure and it was high so they admitted me and gave me pain medication. My first night on the Primrose ward I felt the staff care was ok but after that I didn't find them very helpful at all.\nThe physio came to see me and confirmed I was given a Zimmer frame as she said it was one of the most severe cases if SPD she had seen. I could not walk without falling and had actually fractured my arm from falling the day I came to triage. \nI had to wait 2 days for my sister to come to have a shower as none or the midwives were prepared to help me at all. When I did eventually get in there my sister called them to ask if they could clean the bath as it was dirty. The midwife just walked off, we thought she was coming back but after waiting 20 mins she called them back and the midwife just shoved the cloth across the desk to her. We were appalled. \nI felt every doctor who saw me gave me different information and by the time I was discharged I couldn't be more happy. I was told I'd receive a call on the Monday with my physio appointment. No call. I called them and they had no idea who I was. I took two weeks of me suffering at home in pain before I could even sort an appointment date.\nFast forwarding now to when I was 35 weeks I was admitted once again for SPD as my physio wasn't happy sending me home after my appointment due to me nearly passing out twice and shaking and throwing up from the pain. I was told I could get to talk to the consultant but was sent home with no talk or appointment. By this point my mother in law who knows a lot of the doctors and consultants in this hospital due to her working with them previously she rang and got me an appointment straight away. \nI went on the Monday as scheduled to my appointment along with my 1 year old daughter in a lot of pain to wait hours and be told to come back next week as the consultant was in emergency surgery. I came away crying which lead to another angry call from my mother in law to actually find out the consultant was on annual leave for the whole week! By this point I felt they were just making a mockery of me I was so upset in a wheelchair with my 1 year old daughter I left the hospital gutted. The week after I went back with my mother in as and they tried the same thing but she was having none of it so we came away with a date if induction at 37 weeks pregnant.\nMy birth experience on the labour ward just upset me when I look back I don't like to think of it because it still upsets me. I spent 10 hours on delivery suite before I gave birth and the whole time I was refused pain relief being told I was not in labour. My contractions were clearly showing in the monitor every 1. 5 minutes but still I was refused a private room and pain relief as I was only 3 cm dilated. I had explained that I labour very quickly and with my daughter I shot from 4-10 in the space of about 3 minutes.\nI was told to go in the bath and my fiance sent home. I cried uncontrollably when they told him to leave as in knew my body and knew the baby was coming. I begged him not to leave but they kicked him out. \nAfter that everything happened so fast I don't remember much details apart from I had a sharp pain and my body started pushing. I was rushed into a private room and my the time I rolled on to the bed with one push he was out. My fiance was devastated and so was I, he had only reached the hospital escalators. I had a birth plan and he wanted to cut the cord but he missed it all. He was allowed back in to see me and our son while the midwives started cleaning the room for somebody else. \nI felt we were rushed out the room and then told we could stay in another room for 4 hours which would have been 2 am and then take him home even though we had no car seat on us. I refused and the midwife was quite insistent on us leaving. I refused to take my son home in what would have had to be a taxi at that time as family aren't local and have no car seat. With a huff we were told I could go home but my fiance was quite nastily told he had to leave after only holding his son for 10 mins and missing the birth. I did ask for help breastfeeding as it was offered to my the first time round and it didn't go well so I hoped to get the bond in right away. The midwife told me its not important at this stage and she had other things to do.\nI was admitted up to the ward then where I found the staff were surprisingly helpful and lovely. I asked for help and the lovely midwife in shift managed to help me and my son bond and I successfully breastfed him. She even came to help me when he wouldn't settle by walking him up and down the ward so I could try and sleep. I left the hospital the day after with very mixed opinions.\nI understand there are good and bad experiences in every hospital and I was unlucky and also fortunate enough to experience both.\nI feel that when the standard if service is bad it's really bad but then those few lovely midwives make up for it all. I will never EVER forget my experience with my son being made to feel like a nuisance just for being in labour and having no pain relief regardless of my pelvic problems, then my fiance missing the birth of our son but then I will never forget the amazing magical experience I had with my first.\nI'm unsure if I will be returning to this hospital again but thought I'd share my story for others unsure of their decision.", "Dear LoMay,\r\nMy name is Kim Lacey and I am the Clinical Service Manger for the team you refer to in your posting.

IV furosemide was administered and water intake vs output recorded. Very successful results were obtained given the circumstances of his health. However I believe the care he received has to be in doubt.\n1. Pain relief for Hip, 1g paracetamol QDS not administered. (Only 1g per day! )\n2. Left sitting in chair for hours at a time in pain.\n3. Catheter bag on two or more occasions left on top rung of walking frame and clearly above bladder. Possibly for a whole morning.\n4.

This is because we understood that our mum would only be slid across onto a pressure mattress there would be no need for her to get out of bed. This didn't happen. We feel the nursing staff overruled our wishes and had our Mother get out of bed, even when she was so unwell having had two collapsed lungs and recovered.\n \nWhen mum was able to get back in bed, I understand she used the support over her head to pull herself up, on doing so, she collapsed and died. I and my family are scared that too much pressure had been placed by the nursing staff on getting our Mum out of bed and that this would have made her very anxious and may have contributed to her efforts to overexert herself when getting back into bed. The lady opposite my Mother called to me and said, \u2018your mum put up a good fight this morning'.\n \nWhen I and my family arrived at the hospital it seemed to us no-one had the decency to come and talk to us about what had happened to our Mother especially when she was due to come home just days later.

We were regular visitors. I have reckoned up at least 26 different days of visiting, sometime twice a day, and my sister and niece visited on most days when I didn't.\nChronology\nMy mother was admitted to St Helier hospital in mid 2013 and spent three weeks on Care of the Elderly ward A6. The reason for admission was the rapid onset of a lack of mobility; she was also suffering from urinary incontinence and moderate dementia. Her lack of mobility led to her being doubly incontinent almost immediately.\nAs her mobility improved, she was released to home with increased care package.\nShe was readmitted via A&E after 10 days, again to ward A6 as she had again stopped walking. Her mobility and dementia commenced a rapid decline in hospital. After protracted negotiations with Sutton Social Services she was discharged to an excellent care home in September.\nShe passed away, in the care home, two weeks later from Alzheimer's dementia and a urinary tract infection.\nMum's treatment in hospital\nWe were asked about my mother's eating preferences \u2013 she had never liked soup or yoghurt, so requested that she should have alternatives. In spite of continually repeating this, she was still being supplied with soup and yoghurt, which mostly remained unconsumed, until she was discharged.\nThe hospital wouldn't syringe her ears \u2013 a procedure carried out by her GP regularly \u2013 hence her hearing became an issue and probably added to her increased withdrawal and isolation. The olive oil drops in evidence when she was first admitted had disappeared from view by the end of the third week (my sister tells me she found them her bedside cabinet, where they remained).\nMy niece cleaned and trimmed her fingernails on her visits \u2013 no attention seem to be paid to this or her toenails by the ward staff \u2013 they seemed to be happy to treat an ailment but not care for the patient. When it was confirmed that the hospital could not provide a chiropodist, it still took persistent questioning to find out if I could arrange an external chiropodist to visit. Her toothbrush remained in her bedside cabinet, apparently unused, throughout her stay. There is a lack of many of the support structures that would improve life for patients on the ward, except for hairdressing (paid for by the patient; but which strikes me as less important than some other aspects) but not general hair washing.\nThe tea lady told my sister that mum was quite chirpy in the morning when she was sitting up. However, on each of the few occasions she could visit at 2pm, the start of visiting, to try to see mum while still up she was already in bed and the notes said she was put back to bed at 2pm. This was also my experience \u2013 when arriving early for review meetings, mother was much brighter and sitting out of bed.\nVisiting is discouraged outside the published hours, although I was never challenged when attending meetings outside these. Surely in Mum's case it would have been beneficial for a relative to help at mealtimes?\nMother's deterioration was constant, with apparently no adjustment to care/treatment even when it became obvious to all that she was rejecting the drugs (spitting out pills and throwing away liquids), not drinking or eating properly, therefore becoming malnourished and losing weight. Despite her obviously losing weight (she was never overweight) over a period of many weeks, it was only on the day that agreement was finally reached on her care home place she had been placed on a drip, which kept her in hospital for another 3 days.\nUnderstanding the patient\nMy niece and her daughter witnessed mum's transfer from A&E to the ward. In her own words:\n\u201c We could hear grandmother screaming when we entered the ward. I could hear the nurses talking to her: the nurse said \"don't kick me or I'll kick you and stop being such a baby\" she also said don't bite or I'll bite you back\". At this point I intervened and explained I was her granddaughter and advised I had heard what they had said and that I didn't think what they had said was very nice. The nurse the nurse said \"well she was scratching biting and kicking\". I said that still doesn't excuse the way your talking to her she has Alzheimer's and is confused by what's going on and she has very thin delicate skin. I also explained that I had my daughter with me and we'd both found it very distressing the way that they were treating her.\nI helped calm grandmother down and they put her into the bed without saying anything more.\nI spoke to one of the nurses afterwards and said that it might have been useful to read her notes before they'd tried to transfer her. She said the notes hadn't yet come up from the previous ward. Considering she was being transferred to the elderly ward I would have thought they would be more used to dealing with Alzheimer's, confused, elderly, scared patients.\nI didn't make a formal complaint at the time as I could see from the faces of the nurses id confronted that I'd not made myself popular and I was worried that this may affect grandmother's ongoing care. \u201d\nThere appeared to be a general lack of understanding of the condition of most of the patients on the ward. The majority of patients, all elderly ladies, seemed to be suffering a degree of dementia, confusion and fright. A number of times staff were observed asking indirect questions of patients such as \u2018are you experiencing any discomfort' and \u2018when did you last have a bowel movement' \u2013 both of which were met with blank stares.\nMuch time of staff is spent writing in and reading the patients' folders \u2013 one at the end of the bed and the other kept in a \u2018locked' filing trolley (rarely actually locked). On approaching a bed, it is not immediately obvious what the patient's name or their state of health or mind is. This results in a blanket approach to all patients: as the staff and doctors seem to change rapidly they cannot quickly understand if the patient hasn't heard, doesn't understand or is ignoring questions or requests; all of which I observed with my mother.\nIn order for staff to quickly identify with patients' condition, needs and communication abilities there should be a very clear and obvious statement their abilities and requirements at the bedside \u2013 presumably in the bedside folder \u2013 rather than the opaque tick lists (which I managed to find hidden amongst the many pages of records in the bed folder) or in many pages of handwritten script in remote folders. Why are patient's names not in plain view at the bed?\nPatients have a large orange call button to press if they need help. My mother didn't understand what this was, could not physically press it herself and when I operated it (whilst in a separate bedroom for MRSA cleansing) it was 9 minutes before anyone came.\nPatient Information Station\nOn the ward there is a large illuminated sign by a cell of desks with a \u2018Patient Information Station' sign. Often there doesn't seem to be anyone there to ask questions \u2013 and even if there is, if you don't interrupt someone you are ignored. Quite commonly you are asked to wait for someone else to (not) answer your questions or wait while the \u2018secret folder' is pored over for any useful information, usually with little success.\nMy sister reports: we never received a missing discharge letter from the first three week stay \u2013 it was requested by the GP and social services. I asked several times and I stood at the \"station\" for about 10 minutes one day while one of the nurses tried to find it, first in the secret files then on the computer, when eventually she said she had found it, between two of them they couldn't work out how to print me out a copy, eventually they agreed to sort it out later and post it to me and it never arrived.\nWhen supplying information or making a request on the patient's behalf it is written in the folder \u2013 my experience was that this is never actioned \u201cCan you arrange for my chiropodist for my mother? \u201d was written in the book twice \u2013 eventually, when asked, the house doctor spent 10 minutes finding the sister to get the answer that the hospital can't arrange that.\nThere seems to be no strategy for communication with relatives/carers. It was very difficult to find out anything about mum's treatment, diagnosis or condition. There are no doctors available during evening visiting hours which is when working relatives can attend. It seems a different model of ward is required for those unable to communicate for themselves.\nWard Staff\nIn spite of printing out the uniforms section from the hospital website, it was nearly impossible to identify the level of nursing staff and identify a doctor. Many of the nursing staff in dark blue uniforms referred me to another in the same uniform when I requested information \u2013 even when at the \u2018Information Station'.\nI found the attitude of many of these nurses towards me to be intimidating, as if I were a nuisance getting in the way. In one instance when asking a question the answer was so grudgingly given as to be positively rude. Often they did not engage with the patients, not introducing themselves or even saying hello when approaching the patient, for whatever reason. Many had thick foreign accents which exacerbated understanding difficulties, adding to the issues most of the patients had in coping with their situation.\nA quote from my niece \u201c\u2026on one occasion the bed smelt of faeces and there was some on her hands, sheets and in her nails. I asked the nurse to clean her up and she said she was dealing with another patient first. I was there for a good 20 minutes before she came to sort her out. She looked at Diddy and said \u2018oh it's her I'll need to get some help with this one'. I had to leave at that point while the nurse went to find another nurse. I overhead the other nurse say I've got the medication to give out she'll have to wait.\nIt shocked me that often in the evening there would only be 2 nurses on ward for all the high dependent patients they needed to care for\u201d\nThere was never a sense of business on the ward. Things were done slowly and intentionally: reading files, walking about with bits of paper, looking for someone, talking on the telephone. The atmosphere from these nurses generally was one of resentful tolerance of visitors and patients. The more junior staff on the ward had a more caring attitude and seemed to be the people doing all the real care work.\nAt, I assume, shift handover time (during evening visiting hours) a group of four or five nurses in dark blue uniforms would drift along the foot ends of beds and discuss, with reference to a single sheet of paper, presumably, the patient in the bed. The patient was rarely acknowledged and I certainly wasn't. A thoroughly depressing experience (with all the writing and reading of the \u2018secret' folder, why is that not used at this point? )\nDoctors are indistinguishable from visitors, making a meaningful interaction with them difficult. The patients appear to be attended to by a small team of unidentified doctors at any one time \u2013 the only name generally offered was that of the consultant, whom I managed to talk to on the phone but never saw on the ward. I did have a deep conversation with a doctor after she visited the bed, when I had offered some information on my mother. However, I only saw this lady once or twice again. My mother asked me on more than one occasion \u2018who's that' when a doctor was trying to elicit information (or blood) from her.\nMood on the ward\nThere was generally a feeling of depression in the ward. Very few of the patients were capable of reading and were not encouraged to engage with each other in any way. The only entertainment provided was via the \u2018pay to view' TV system, which supplied free BBC radio stations and the hospital radio channel \u2013 which played a selection of mostly pop music. However, given the age and abilities of the patients, none of them were, as far as I could tell, capable of operating the system. Indeed I had to help one of the staff turn the radio on for a patient. The pay to view TV, apart from the appalling expense (\u00a310 for 24 hours from when bought), was difficult for my daughter, who is very IT literate, to operate.\nThis resulted in a very sterile social and sensory environment \u2013 further adding to the isolation, confusion and anxiety of the patients.\nPatients would recover more quickly and be more cooperative if they could feel happy in their environment. A central entertainment system, with communal TV and music appropriate to the age group would help this, as would a form of social interaction between patients and staff.\nVisitors, who could make a difference to the atmosphere, are not encouraged. There are no facilities on the ward \u2013 I could not find water tap or visitor toilet, I was never once offered a drink, even when they were being provided to the patients. The coffee bar is eight minutes and the shop six minutes walk from the ward, down and six floors. A long time away in a 2 hour visiting slot.\nThe hospital website states \u2018Visiting is restricted to 2. 30pm - 5pm and 6pm - 8pm to allow time for patient care and meal times', but patient care seems to carry on in visiting times and help at mealtimes could be useful (as above), so why be so restrictive?\nWith the feeling and approach of the staff on the ward, we were worried that complaining formally during her stay would further prejudice the staff attitude to my already very vulnerable mother. I did approach the PALS service at the very beginning of her first stay (about the sombre mood of the ward and the TV system) but could not structure my further comments in order to approach them further.\nThe contrast with the care home was stark and shocking: a happy, vibrant atmosphere, with music, chatting and many caring staff - I only managed to visit twice (no restriction on visiting hours and happy to let me help with meals) \u2013 both times I was asked if I'd like a drink and it was bought to me.\nOther points\nI witnessed some records, notably those pertaining to meals and position in/out of bed, being updated after the event. Two days' records missing one day and filled in the next.\nThe \u2018patient information'/nurses station was extremely cluttered with signs/notes/posters stuck on the walls and windows \u2013 some of which were two years out of date. Many of these were reminding staff of tasks which would appear to be a normal part of their responsibilities. This added to the gloomy and unstructured feeling of the ward.", "On a Saturday recently my friend rushed me to A&E. I had a severe headache, had been vomiting non stop all day, was shaking uncontrollably. I could barely keep my eyes open due to the pain that lights were causing me and was struggling to walk. \nMy friend (who works in the hospital) knew that there was something seriously wrong however on arrival at A&E she tried to explain my symptoms to be stopped and told that 'its not really appropriate for A&E'. \nShe was then handed a leaflet about NHS24 which the receptionist explained was the procedure she should follow next time. We were then pointed a room to call NHS24 as the receptionist claimed there was no way she could get my details on the system unless we called them - complete nonsense. \nAs my friend called NHS24 I continued to vomit all over the floor as we hadn't even been given a bucket even though she had tried to tell them I was being sick all day long. After 30 minutes we were then allowed to sit in the A&E waiting room for about an hour before being seen. \nThankfully the doctor that saw me identified in less than 15 minutes that I likely had meningitis and I was rushed up to admissions to receive treatment. It seems that going to A&E really was appropriate considering how ilI was. With my temperature being at 40 by the time I was able to be seen, the time wasted calling NHS24 was not needed. \nLuckily, on this occasion, a patients life was not severely affected but I fear that in future this could very well happen if reception staff are not trained on how to deal with people that arrive. To also make blatant lies about not being able to get my details on the system unless I called NHS24 was utterly inappropriate and the member of staff I feel has been negligent in their behaviour on this occasion. \nPeople do not arrive at A&E to be judged - perhaps if this happened any other night than a Saturday night I would have been treated with a bit of care and concern. \nIt was lucky my friend was able to take me to A&E and call NHS24, if I had to go on my own I would simply not have been able to call them - I was seriously ill. In this scenario are patients just told to leave because their illness 'isnt really appropriate for A&E'? Other than this my stay in hospital went well. Both doctors and nurses provided a high level of care and put me at ease throughout my illness.", "Dear Pr0spect\nWhat a frightening experience for you or anyone to have to go through. I am really sorry that we did not manage your attendance at A&E as well as we should but thankfully you got a high level of care from the doctors and nurses and I do hope you are feeling very much better.\nI will discuss your experience with the Head of Service for the Emergency Department and also the Clinical Director for the Medical Division in the Hospital. Once if find out more I will be back in touch.\nThank you for taking the time to feed-back and our sincere apologies for how we made you feel when you most needed our help and expertise.\nMaimie", "I was admitted to the Peter Hodgkinson Centre with severe depression following the loss of my baby. I was told that I would have a named nurse to support me and draw up a care plan and also a daily 1-2-1 with a nurse on duty. \nThis is what actually happened. My named nurse would have a brief chat with me while passing me in a corridor and would always promise to draw up my care plan the next time she was on duty as she was too busy now. I finally received my care plan a few days before being discharged. I was in hospital for 4 weeks. \nA list would be put up in the dining room informing patients who their 1-2-1 would be with each day. I actually received three 1-2-1's during my stay as the nurses always said they were too busy. This didn't actually bother me as I was too depressed to want to talk anyway. However I did witness other patients crying and distressed, begging for a nurse to talk to which I found horrendous and inhumane. \nI felt my consultant who I saw once a week would speak down to me and seemed to treat me like some kind of naughty school child. During 1 meeting, I was so anxious that I could not speak as my mouth became so dry. When I said that I needed a glass of water, my consultant told me that I should have had 1 before the meeting.\nA couple of the nurses were nice and supportive but the majority did not seem to be in the slightest bit interested in providing the required care and support of which they are trained and paid to do so. I was even called a stupid cow by 1 of the night nurses and subjected to constant threats of having personal items taken away from me.

I was then diagnosed with IBS (irritable bowel). By June my Hb dropped to 8 and still the various GPs said IBS. \nI went to A&E in August and \"constipation\" they said, and sent me home with 2 suppositories. Several emergency paramedic and A&E visits later, 2 hospital stays, ultrasounds, OGD and colonoscopy I was told under heavy sedation that I probably had bowel cancer. That was Oct 2014. \nSeven weeks after a right hemicolectomy, I'm still awaiting chemotherapy for Dukes C adenocarcinoma with lymph node involvement.\nI had to ask my GP practice to stop permitting my pharmacy to collect the IBS treatment for, as noted, my diagnosis is cancer.\nI'm scared, only 49, widowed and a single mom of 1.\nI simply wish that all health care professionals remember to think outside the box each time they see a patient.

Her partner phoned the ambulance service, and was told to leave it for 20 minutes and call back if no improvement.\nMy mother stopped breathing and her partner called the service once more (some few minutes after the initial call). This time he was taken seriously and an ambulance arrived about 15 minutes later, yet despite the efforts of the paramedics, my mother passed away. \n\nI would like two questions answered please: \n\n1. Is it SW Ambulance policy to tell people who call for emergency assistance, that they should wait for a worsening of symptoms and only then call back? Can I have the name and contact details of the person who agreed to this policy please? I wish to speak with them personally to try to understand the reasoning behind this. \n\n2. Why did it take 15 minutes for an ambulance to eventually arrive at my mother's bungalow? Was there an abnormally high call rate? were you understaffed?\n\nI would really appreciate some honest answers here. And I really do not want to be fobbed off with a 'lessons learned' narrative.", "I want to share the experience of my mothers stay at an inpatient ward in Queen Charlottes Hospital in Hammersmith. What she was subjected to was in my opinion one of the most disgusting and inhumane experiences in her life. She was in recovery on an inpatient ward after an operation. The surgeon was absolutely fantastic, and the operation was a success. The aftercare however was something I wouldn't put my pet dog through.\n\nShe was subjected to lack of care and due attention by a particular nurse and to call her a nurse would be a stretch of the imagination. My mother was kept on morphine and sleeping for large amounts of her time in the ward. My mother overheard her speaking and belittling her to the other nurses and saying- I don't understand people how have legs and the means to walk, and chose not to. She then instructed other nurses to not walk my mother to the shower room as it was too much effort to use the harness, and to just give her a bed bath. When the care assistants asked,shouldn't we walk her to the shower? , they were instructed by the nurse to do as they were told.\n\nBeing an independent woman, and always on her feet, she found the morphine overbearing and just needed a little help to walk. From walking up to the shower room before her operation, she was left weaker and unable to walk just 7 days later from lack of fluids, food (from not being able to settle her vomiting) and constantly being given morphine as a panacea for all her requests for relief.\n\nMy mother then had a UTI and asked for antibiotics, as the pain was unbearable. The pain was so severe, that my mother was shouting out her own mothers name whilst in pain. We then called a nurse, who sent a care assistant 20 mins later. They said they couldn't do anything as it was beyond their jurisdiction. They then called the same nurse in question and asked my mum why didn't she just have the morphine when she was told earlier. My mum responded that she wasn't in pain then. She then asked how long the results of her urine test would take to come back. The nurse completely disregarded this and said, you should have taken the morphine when we told you. My mother asked her, how long the morphine would last as she was given 2. 5ml earlier, to which the nurse responded, I don't know, we just give it when you need and everyone is different.  My mother asked what time the last sub cut was given, to which the nurse responded I don't know, I'll just give you another 2. 5ml. When asked shouldn't she investigate the cause of the pain, she responded, no, pain is our first attention, the rest just follows.\n\nFinally, before her transfer to Charing Cross hospital, my mother was inspected by a doctor, who was shocked to see that her stitches had not been removed as instructed three days prior. \n \nMy mother then said that the wound should be dressed as it starting oozing and seeping as she was on blood thinners, and the heal time takes longer. The nurse who was fully aware responded that there is no need for a dressing, it will stop itself. As a consequence, her nightdress stuck to her skin.\nOn transferring her to Charing Cross, the nurse and doctor were horrified at her treatment, wounds, and the fact there she was not given her afternoon medicine on handover. They said it was fundamental nursing to dress a wound to stop infections. My mother then burst into tears, and she was consoled by the doctor and nurse in charge, and was assured that her care was now the upmost priority. My mother said she wasn't lying as she wants to walk and get better, and proof was there for everyone when the physiotherapist in Charring Cross helped my mum walk with a frame in that week for 3 days in a row.\nAs a nurse with 45 years experience, and working and paying tax in the UK for 40 years, she was shocked at her ordeal. Is this the standard bearing care and support from our \u2018flagship' NHS?\n\nMy mother has recently passed away due to Cancer which she has been fighting for the last eight months. It is upsetting and horrendous that she had to face such an ordeal in her last few weeks of life. My feeling is that I am utterly disgusted that this person is allowed to practice as a nurse, let alone have verbal contact with patients. People are in hospital because they are sick or trying to recover, away from their families and familiar surroundings. To have to be faced with someone who calls themselves a nurse that is in my view inconsiderate, with no empathy, sympathy or even a shred of emotion should not even be allowed.

It is always difficult to persuade the service to come and assess the patients.\nThey will flatly refuse to see a patient unless they are \"medically fit\", irrespective of the Royal College of Psychiatry guidelines which state that patients who have medical problems which do not affect their mental state are fit to be assessed. The service will often insist over the phone that our patients are \"not medically fit\" despite senior A&E clinicians who have physically seen and examined the patient deeming them to be medically fit. In my opinion it is absolutely unprofessional to draw such a conclusion over the phone without having seen the patient, especially when a senior clinician experienced in the relevant field has deemed so otherwise.\nYesterday I had a psychotic patient expressing clear delusions, with a history of psychiatric admissions, who was established on a atypical antipsychotic so was highly likely to be known to the local Mental Health service. After establishing that the patient was medically fit via an extensive examination and review of blood tests, I contacted the service. \nI was told that \"we can't look up any information because our computer system is broken\". I was rung back an hour later being told that \"we're not coming to assess the patient because we think it's probably a UTI\". \nThey had not seen the patient, had not taken a history and had not consulted the blood results. I had to divert staff from a serious case in the Resuscitation room to obtain an unnecessary urine dip, to prove to Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Trust Access and Assessment Service that my patient was not suffering from a UTI. The urine dip was negative, so I rang the service back and after some resistance got them to agree to assess the patient. Upon arriving, they then decided to send the patient home and assess them the following day instead.\nThe service staff I have met have come across as bone-idle and obstructive. They have discounted expert opinion from other senior clinicians in order to avoid having to come and assess patients. They have asked for extra unnecessary tests to be performed to delay having to come out. \nI have never had a helpful experience when referring patients.", "My dear friend is now very unwell with Leukaemia and when last weighed was 3 Stone 4 pounds. She is unable to move from her couch and is in constant pain. Her late husband abused her over many years but was particularly good friends with her GP and discussed her care multidisciplinary care plan before he died of an alcohol related illness. For some reason she has been put on a violent patient scheme but has never been assessed or given any treatment. She now can barely eat and drink and has apparently gastroenteritis although that is not a confirmed diagnosis but I would expect this is a symptom of her illness. Unfortunately it is unlikely she will live a great deal longer.\nWhat is sickening is that her GP refuses to visit her, she has no services or equipment and she is being refused any direct medical assistance and she is powerless to change her GP because of this status she has been given. She is very bright and astute and clearly desperate for some palliative care. A woman who has given her life to helping others should not be treated in this way in her last few weeks or months.", "I feel my dad was let down badly by the treatment for his lung cancer.\nWhen he was diagnosed he was told it was not possible to operate and he then had to wait for a further appointment to discuss his options.\nThis took a few weeks and I accompanied him during this visit.

I felt we were treated like a number and when I asked why it was not possible to operate - I was not told that it was because dad was not fit enough but that 'we just don't do that when we are unable to cure the patient'.\nDad then had to wait more weeks and in the end he actually passed away before he even saw the Oncologist.\nI even asked our local GP to chase the appointment and called Raigmore to also chase but as the Oncologist was on holiday no one could see my dad to help.\nI feel that if we had been seen quicker and possibly offered radiotherapy my dad would have had a slightly longer time with us.\nWhen he did pass away we had no MacMillan Nurse and no support and we ended up caring for dad until his last with the support of the local Paramedic Team - who I have to say were brilliant.\nSince then I know of other patients with the same diagnosis as my dad was given who have been lucky enough to have seen the Oncologist and have been offered treatment.

His symptoms were dismissed as minor, no further investigations were ordered, and so his condition was left for a full year before a proper diagnosis was made. He was finally taken more seriously, and urgently referred to hospital for more tests. However, by this time he had stage 3 bowel cancer, and after chemotherapy and two major surgeries he died seven months later. He was 28.\nThe first GP diagnosed a \u201clikely internal pile\u201d with no onward referral for investigation. They advised my partner to return if \u201c++ bleeding/pain/masses\u201d. This advice was not very helpful and I feel he should have been told to return if bleeding persisted at all, heavy or not. As it was he felt the small amount of blood found in his stools over the next few months was nothing to worry about.\nHe returned for the second visit 6 months later regarding his ongoing diarrhea and bleeding. He had lost more weight and was experiencing significant pain. The doctor noted that my partner thought he had IBS because a sibling had the same condition, and prescribed Fybogel and suggested a food diary to find trigger foods. The doctor did not carry out any examination to check whether my partner's layman's self diagnosis was accurate, no ongoing monitoring was discussed, nor were any further investigations requested. My partner was left feeling that his condition was not medically significant and he should not worry about it.\nIt was not until he saw a third doctor and presented with emergency symptoms of anaemia and a raised temperature that he was rushed to hospital where they carried out a colonoscopy and after a month's stay discovered he had bowel cancer, which was so advanced it had eaten through his bowel wall. An operation was carried out to remove a section of his bowel and he came home after a further month's stay. He then saw an oncologist who recommended 6 months worth of treatment but the cancer returned within 4 months with metastasis to the liver and abdomen. A second operation was carried out somewhat successfully but the cancer continued to spread and my partner tragically lost his life in November at a local hospice.\nI feel that there were missed opportunities by the GPs for monitoring and further investigations which could have picked up the cancer in its much earlier stages when it may well still have been survivable.\nIt is not my intention to make trouble for the GPs involved or to ask for compensation. I feel very strongly that my partner's relatively early age at onset is what left him undiagnosed: I fear his GPs assumed that he was too young to have bowel cancer and dismissed this possible diagnosis when making their differential diagnoses. I have heard lots of similar stories about other people being misdiagnosed due to their age too. Maybe GPs need to make onward referrals for colonoscopy, or at the very least make a monitoring plan for patients with a similar presentation so that further possible unnecessary deaths are prevented in the future as bowel cancer is a curable disease if caught early enough.\nI believe these safeguards need to be put in place urgently to help stop this awful loss from happening again to another family. Clinical guidelines for younger people with cancer symptoms are needed urgently.", "I'm very sorry to hear about your experience here. From your description there is clearly an opportunity to improve the care your partner received and learning so that other people don't suffer.\r\nIt would be very helpful if you could contact me in confidence so that I can follow this up.\r\nMark Spencer, Medical Director for Quality (mark.spencer@nhs.net)\r\nDavid Finch, Area Medical Director", "We're very sorry to hear about your partner's experience, our sympathies are with you.\r\nI'm from the charity Beating Bowel Cancer and we're working to raise awareness of the condition in all age groups.

More information about the charity can be found on our website: www.beatingbowelcancer.org.\r\nWe're always keen to hear of patients experiences around GPs and cancer referrals, so if you'd like to get in touch to discuss further, please email me on elspeth.mcausland@beatingbowelcancer.org.\r\nBest wishes,\r\nElspeth", "We are pleased to hear that your experiences of our antenatal and NICU services was so good, especially during such a traumatic time for you and your baby, and that your baby is now doing well. However, we are disappointed and concerned to hear that your experience of our post-natal ward was poor.\r\nWhilst we appreciate it is very difficult for mothers with babies going to NICU, all women (following a caesarean section) will need to be initially cared for in the dedicated ward bay following surgery. This is for safety reasons and so close observations can be carried out. However, we endeavour to move women in your situation to their own room as quickly as possible once they are stable and a side room is available. We apologise if you felt there was a unnecessary delay in this taking place.\r\nWithout knowing the full details of when you stayed with us it is difficult to comment, but we have made recent improvements to distributing pain killers on the ward. We now run four hourly drug rounds and if a woman misses the round for any reason (such as visiting their baby in NICU) they can ask their nominated named midwife to give the medication separately. We hope this will improve the process for women in our care and ensure that everyone on the ward receives painkillers in a timely way.\r\nAgain, it is difficult to comment specifically without reviewing your notes, but we are sorry the care you received after discharge was not better planned. Sometimes if a woman is visiting her baby in NICU and unlikely to be at home for the community midwife to visit for postnatal checks, we will arrange for the follow-up appointments to take place on Joan Booker Ward instead. Usually we would \u2018handover' the care of women who have experienced high blood pressure (as part of pre-eclampsia in pregnancy) to their GP two weeks after discharge and any further checks would take place through the GP surgery.\r\nOverall, we are sorry that some aspects of the care we provided fell short and I would welcome the opportunity to discuss everything with you in more detail. If you are willing to do so then please contact me directly.\r\nKind regards\r\nDeborah Parkinson, Lead Midwife\r\n01932 722392", "Thank you for taking the time to get in touch with us, and I apologise for the delay in responding.

There were twins but no heartbeats. The sonographer was very blas\u00e9 about it and told me to book a ERPC that afternoon. I was devastated. Her attitude really upset me - obviously for her it was an everyday occurrence but my world was falling apart. Since this happened nearly 3 years ago, I hope staff now will have had better training to deal with painful news more sensitively.\nAt the EPAU the nurse told me I already had enough children. The anaesthetist also upset me. I'm sure he meant well but he seemed extremely flippant and jokey and I became extremely stressed going into theatre. I was already in a distressed state and I felt that he was making fun. It just felt really inappropriate. \nLater on the ward I was left haemorrhaging for many hours and was left alone in the bathroom despite already having fainted twice from loss of blood. Due to being left so long I needed a transfusion of 4 pints of blood which in my opinion would not have been necessary if I had been monitored properly and dealt with more quickly. To be fair, the ward staff were very nice, just too busy. ", "My Dad went into Whiston hospital on a thursday night, he was ill but not too bad. He was placed on 5a over the weekend and he was given antibiotics and responded well. He was getting close to full fitness (for him) but on the Saturday night the week after he went in he started to say some strange things. This to the people who knew him was a red flag, we all knew he was in the early stages of infection.\r\nOn the Sunday we were called in by staff asking if someone could come in and calm my Dad down as he was very agitate, we took it in turns to sit with him over a 12 hour period and we only saw a student nurse come in on 3 occasions, each time we pleaded with them to find someone who could start him on antibiotics or do something knowing it was going to only get worse. It had been over a week since he had gone in and every time we asked if it was possible to see a Dr, each time we were told that the Dr's were very busy and couldn't come to see us.\r\nMonday and Tuesday had gone by and my Dad still hadn't been started on any medication, we got told on Tuesday that he had a fall the night before, he was hallucinating and was really confused. Anyone who knew my Dad knows that when he is well he's sharp as a tack but with him being put on 5a which is a ward for the elderly I got the feeling the staff just saw him as a confused old man.

I have a concern about my wife's posture in bed from an aspiration view point and her skin condition due to lack of bathing and creaming\nPoint 2 - on visiting her at 13.00 I noticed that she had soiled herself in an open pad. I asked a nurse to check. I then notice that due to the inappropriate routing of her peg that it was covered in feces. The nurse said she would log this, cleaned my wife up but left the peg routed under her nightie. I pointed out the safer route is via the neck opening in the nightie. This needs to be recorded as my wife could well develop additional problems due to bad practice i.e. inappropriate pads being used or inappropriate routing of the peg. What I also expect to happen is that the Y adapter is changed and the peg checked by a professional\nPoint 3 - my wife has not been given much of her medication. This needs to happen as indicated. Medication documentation have been lost, duplicated and recovered. This clearly needs to be reviewed as my wife's condition requires regular use of the medication. I have done what I can to provide medication and tables for when and what to administer.

She had complex health needs, was 23 years old and ventilator dependent. As her mother I was also her main carer, she was transfered from another hospital as an emergency with a blocked shunt and was unconscious. She went straight to theatre, then to intensive care. She still remained unconscious and prognosis was dire. I was only allowed to visit during the five hours visiting time, despite being with her usually as her carer 24 hours. There were no chairs for visitors, I had to ask for an air mattress for her, this wasn't supplied for 30 hours. We were never spoken to by a senior neurologist, her drain in her head stopped working and I had to ask staff repeatedly to call a doctor. When a junior Dr did eventually come and confirm this they gave us an option of doing nothing about it. On the second day there (my daughters last) I took photographs of her, only to be stopped by a nurse because my daughter hadn't consented! However no one actually asked me about her care or medication or legal status as we parents both had lasting power of attorney. I followed a member of the public in one visiting time and the curtains were drawn around my daughters bed, I went in to find a nurse taking a photograph of my daughters five year old pressure sore, who consented for this to be taken? Her gown that she left her previous hospital wearing was not changed during her two and a half days, she was freezing to touch and when I pointed this out the nurse reluctantly agreed and went to find a bear hugger, coming back to say they were all in use! I slept on a bench in the relatives room for the two nights, only to have the lights put on full and all the windows thrown open by a very rude domestic at 6: 45 am who told me and another relative with a dying husband to get out of the room. Even though my daughter was dying no allowances were made for me to be there, the nurse in charge said they could not set a precedent otherwise all relatives would want to be there. Luckily the Lane Fox unit were happy to have my daughter transferred back to them where she had a dignified death surrounded by staff who cared.", "My first mmc happened in March 2013 and I can't complain about how I was treated other than that when I had to go in to the epu for a confirmation scan, I was seated in a waiting room with happily expecting mums to be with heavily pregnant women wondering past.\nMy second mmc was discovered at the beginning of December and was made even more of a nightmare by how I was treated and the horrendous following weeks.\nAt the beginning of December, I went in to the epc for a routine scan only to be told that our beautiful baby had passed away around a week before. We were given the whole yarn about how miscarriage is very common, which I personally find very heartless. I didn't care about how common it is, I was devastated that it had happened to us!\nI was already well informed about our options because of our first mmc and chose to have an erpc. (I hate that term. This was our baby! Not a \"product\" of conception! Smm is much more tactful and should be more widely used).\nBecause our scan was on a Friday, we had to wait till Monday for the surgery. I was on edge and basically terrified that things would happen naturally in this time but in the end they didn't.\nWhen I went in for surgery on the monday I had to sit, crying and in obvious distress in a full waiting room of other people before the surgeon saw me for the pre-op questions stuff. He was flustered and covered in beads of sweat and the first thing he said to me was \"So you're in for a caesarian today then? \" I don't have words for how hurtful this was and it made me doubt the surgeons capabilities, but I so just wanted to get the physical aspect out of the way I just tried to push the concerns out of my head.\nAfter the surgery, while I was groggy and in so much pain I had been administered morphine, the surgeon came to tell me that I had \"lost more blood than they had hoped\". Though it wasn't explained why or what this meant/impacted etc. I was too 'out of it' to question this at the time.\nFollowing the surgery I developed a post op infection and a uti, despite my impeccable personal hygiene and following the scant aftercare advice I had been given to the letter. For the first ever time in my life I was prescribed antibiotics which made me very confused, suppressed my appetite, gave me diarrhea and vomiting and kept me awake at night.\nAround two weeks after the surgery, the hospital rang to tell me that they had tested what they had taken out of me but weren't able to detect any pregnancy tissue at all! They were telling me that the surgery was a complete failure. Not only that, but they were going to keep me waiting a whole week before they could fit me in for a scan and that said scan would be on Christmas eve.\nI was pretty certain that I hadn't miscarried naturally since the surgery and so had to cope with the thought that I had been carrying around our dead child inside me for weeks and that I had been through surgery for nothing. I also had the overwhelming fear that if something was found to still be present when I was scanned, then I would have to undergo a mva under only local anaesthetic.\nOn Christmas eve we had to wait in a waiting room with women waiting for their 12 week scans with heavily pregnant women from the maternity wing above wondering past. By the time we finally got in called in for our appointment, 2 1/2 hours late, I was a nervous wreck!\nThe scan itself showed that there was nothing in my uterus. The sonographer and the gynecologist present believe that the erpc/smm had actually been successful but that the lab had tested the wrong part of what was taken from me!\nAll of that stress, worry and fear all because they didn't think to carry out their test on another part of what they had taken from me! ? !\nFollowing this scan, it was a further two weeks before the hospital would release our babys remains to the funeral directors so that we could have a funeral and say our goodbyes properly.\nSince this ordeal, I have been having difficulties with anxiety and mood swings. I barely sleep and generally feel like I'm not coping very well. I've been to my gp about this, hoping that I could be referred to a counsellor. My gp told me how common mc is (because that heartless, meaningless rubbish never gets old! ) and that it can take a while to feel better afterwards. I was basically being told that I don't know myself and am not qualified to say that I don't feel right.\nI will be making a formal complaint to our local hospital trust when I am feeling stronger. There are so many aspects concerning the \"care\" I received that I object to that it is difficult to know where to start!\nThere have been some wonderfully caring and compassionate caregivers that we have encountered through this whole thing, but unfortunately, their goodness does not cancel out all of the painful, nightmareish hell that was inflicted upon us by so many others.", "We do take any concerns about patient care seriously.

Whereupon the ICU consultant informed us over my wife's bed in an open ward that they (the MDT) were placing my wife on the 'Liverpool Care Path'. We were subsequently moved to a private medical facility, where my wife spent six months in rehabilitation.\nI raised a complaint via PALS which the trust acknowledged.

Ever since lodging my formal complaint early last year, when it came to almost everything I had to raise, the senior manager in charge of investigating my complaint treated me extremely unfairly/unacceptably (probably because part of my complaint was in connection with an unacceptable letter which had been signed by the person just before I lodged the complaint). \nWhen I raised this situation to the attention of the Trust's Chief Executive it made no difference. Because it repeatedly happened staff members were not coming back to me on a timely basis, when I was writing this Trust relevant letters, I was put into the position of having to contact the Parliamentary Ombudsman and asking their advice/alerting my MP. I was advised by the Parliamentary Ombudsman to send SLAM a request for a final response letter. Not long after addressing this request to the Chief Executive, making it clear that I wished him to respond to me, I was later told by letter that the matter was being dealt with/reviewed by other staff members (although the situation did not call for it) and then told in the final letter response I received (which was from a different person) that one of the other senior staff members involved was saying that it was their view, after looking through my earlier letters to the Trust, that there were no outstanding things that needed to be answered/explained by the Trust - although it should have been obvious to anybody that this was not the case.\n\nAs a result of all this, I am now having to ask the Parliamentary Ombudsman Service to get involved. Had this Trust dealt with my complaint in a fair and reasonable way, by accepting full responsibility for the things they did which were wrong, there would be no need for me to do this - but as they have chosen not to do so, they have put me in this position. I think that the way that I have been treated by them is appalling.", "I have a back condition and my spine is very stiff, so when I slipped and fell flat on my back, I was very concerned that I may have seriously damaged it. \nAn ambulance took me to A&E at East Surrey Hospital. There I explained to everyone about my concern about my spine, and I explained at length about why I believed my spine was vulnerable to damage. The Doctors kept me in for 30 hours, and gave me xrays and a CT scan, and I was eventually assured that there was no damage to my spine and I was sent home.\nThankfully I asked my Rheumatology Consultant at the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases in Bath to have a look at my xrays and scan. He did this and immediately he spotted I had fractured a vertebra. So I went to see the Orthopaedic Consultant at East Surrey Hospital, he had another xray taken, and immediately spotted that the fracture in my neck was so unstable that it was unsafe for me to even go home. I was admitted immediately and four days later he operated to put a plate in my neck.\nHad I not gone for the second opinion, and just taken what the A&E told me, then I could either be a quadriplegic or even dead.", "Dead Redhillchilipepper\r\nI am sorry to read of your experience and understand your concerns.

I am disappointed with the 'service' he has received. It took three months to initially assess him, and I feel that his care has been appalling and sporadic at best. \nMy son is a suicide attempter and a serious self harmer, and the care he has received from very pleasant but extremely overworked and under valued staff, especially at crisis point, I think is negligent and dangerous. \nThe crisis service in particular is at its worst at the times when it should be at its best, weekends, nights, and evenings. There are bad points absolutely too numerous to mention, and the care for carers is no better at all, in my experience although I save the service a considerable amount of time and money and resources by being my son's carer (I do not mind of course, I love him - he is my son).\nI also am undervalued, left in ignorance, and most of the time not spoken to at all, to the point I have ended up in the service myself, which could have been avoided.

The police removed all my items that could endanger me and gave them to the staff, who put them in an unlocked drawer. I suffer with amnesic episodes and was seen by a member of staff removing my belongings and this went unchallenged. \nI had access to a lot of medication and took a massive overdose, which was only realised when the police came to escort me to the ward, as I did not want to be in hospital. They could not wake me. I was then admitted on a ventilator to ITU. It took 3 attempts at trying to get me off the ventilator, until I was able to breathe for myself. \nThe police raised an allegation against the staff of abuse by neglect and this was upheld at a safeguarding adults investigation and subsequent meeting.

The request was blatantly ignored. One doctor argued with me in front of my my relative and said family can only stay with relatives if they are dying. I later met with this doctor who informed me our relative was not dying.\nOur relative lost use of one arm many years ago and their right shoulder had been broken some years ago, because of this our relative struggled to cut up food open containers etc. My sister and I made this known to staff and requested that we stay to help our relative eat and because of their lack of mobility and poor eyesight we asked that they help with medication. This request was refused and we were told that we would have to leave during medication and meal times and that Nurses would assist. At this stage I was already concerned about the care and conflicting information on the MAU. On more than 1 occasion I found our relative sitting in front of a cold tray of food with the food uncut, and tops left on desserts and drinks. When I challenged this Nurses replied that they were busy and they would get round to it. This seemed quite typical in terms of what we saw.\nOur relative was then sent to Ward 22 where they stayed for approximately 2 weeks. Our relative was discharged without an aftercare plan despite them living alone.\nOur relative had also developed a pressure sore on one heal on ward 22. (we think this is more evidence of poor care). The night they got home, our relative fell on the stairs on the way to bed and she was readmitted to ward 32, we were informed that the pneumonia had not cleared. Our relative was eventually discharged with a full aftercare package and still requiring a nurse to dress her pressure sore. They were readmitted again to Ward 15. The pneumomia had not cleared.\nIt was at this point my sister and I decided we should note some of the incidents we observed.\nOn numerous occasions Tablets were left on the table in a dispensing cup Having restricted use of their arm and had poor eyesight our relative could not take their medication unassisted. Despite telling staff about this, it happened time and time again.\nWe requested a meeting with the doctor and the Consultant. Again we raised our concerns about poor treatment and our relatives fear of hospitals and doctors and it was agreed there should be 3 way communication.\nWhen our relative had water retention and her ankles were swollen. The footstool provided was far too high and it was causing pain. The physiotherapist said they would provide a lower footstool.\nWe noticed that Mum was not eating but the food chart stated that our relative was eating almost everything. We informed the nurse. We were told they would monitor her food intake.\nI informed the nurse our relative was in severe pain and was tired, was visibly weaker and appeared to be deteriorating. I asked if the oxygen levels had been tested and I was informed they were OK.\nI spoke to the deputy ward manager and told our relative was still not eating, they were tired and weak and breathing seemed laboured The Deputy Ward Manager told me they were not too weak and that had walked to the toilet alone using her delta frame.\nWe observed that all of our relatives tablets had again been left on the table in the dispensing cup. Mum had been put on oxygen and had deteriorated further. A Nurse brought a drip and hung it over the bed lamp She informed us that our relative had a chest X-Ray and had pneumonia on her lower left lung. Although a cannular was due to be fitted for IV antibiotics early afternoon, it was not fitted until late evening.\nWhen we met with the consultant we asked the prognosis - given the fact that we were told on the MAU that our relative was dying. We were informed that they were poorly and may require an operation on her kidney.\nWe informed him about tablets constantly being left on the table, he said he would speak to the ward manager\nI asked why I was ignored when I had told the nurse I suspected or relatives oxygen levels had dropped and was subsequently proven right there was no reply\nWe informed him that our relative had deteriorated and their speech was not right and the fact they struggled to get to the toilet with a frame and assistance was a long long way from how they were before admission. He did not comment\nWe also informed him that our relative's legs were swollen but despite this no footstool had been provided\nOur relative had not eaten all of her food but the food chart said that it had been eaten. Tea was being counted as fluid (despite the dehydrating effect of caffeine) and our relative was only having small sips of tea. The chart incorrectly recorded the time the cannula was fitted.\nWhile we were there a nurse had asked our relative what they had eaten - They could not remember, it was at this point we realised our relativess food intake was not being monitored.\nIt was noticed that the antibiotic drip had finished and was uncomfortable. We asked for it to be removed in the afternoon. At 7. 15pm I had to ask staff again to remove the same drip. The footstool provided with was on the opposite side of the bed.\nNurse said our relative was lively - this was a lie, their speech was slurred and they were very grey in colour and was lethargic.\nWe met with the consultant and informed him of our grave concerns\nDoctors kept referring to Mums TB - Our mum had NEVER had TB\nWe highlighted that up until admission our relative was able to walk, they were independent despite their impairments. We highlighted that their speech was slurred and they were unable to stand unaided the movement in the left arm had deteriorated and they were drooling from one side of her mouth.\nMy sister asked for our relatives oxygen to be put back on and a Nurse did this. Later the doctor pulled me to one side and told me that ONLY nurses should put the oxygen back on. He was implying that my sister had done this and it was against the agreed plan of care. I informed him that a Nurse had put the oxygen back on. He said nothing in reply.\nTablets left in the dispensing cup on the table but the Nurse informed us they had observed medication being taken. This was untrue.\nOur relative had not had any of her ensure drink. they were clearly upset and had been crying. Our relative informed me that the urologist had told them he was going to put a drain in their kidney \"early next week\". I spoke to nursing staff about this - they were gathered around the table having a chat. They informed me the Urologist had not seen our relative and they were confused. I spoke to the doctor who informed me nothing would happen until the pneumonia had cleared. Once the pneumonia had cleared, they would move our relative to the rehab unit and they would be treated as an outpatient for her kidneys. I went to explain this to our distressed relative, but the patient in the next bed said that she had heard the doctor and our relative was was right. I went back to tell the Nursing staff and they laughed and said \"we have more than one confused patient on the ward' I found this comment particularly offensive and left the ward sobbing as the pressure and stress was becoming too much to bare.\nOur relative had a very sore mouth, it was dry and cut and it was too painful to eat. I asked the Nurse if our relative could have porridge I was told porridge was not on the menu but used a low salt menu to get Mum her porridge.\nOur relative still had difficulty eating their mouth was still very sore I asked another nurse about porridge, she brought a soft food Menu - this had never been offered before.\nI arrived on the ward our relative was sobbing. They had been told they were having a nephostromy tomorrow. A Nurse confirmed this. Again despite numerous requests to be present whenever our relative was seeing a consultant our requests were ignored. We had even put the request in writing.\nOur relative had been put back on oxygen The doctor informed us that they had pus in her kidney and the kidney wont clear while the pus is there so a nephrostomy was essential.\nOur relative was taken down for her Nephrostomy. The surgeon informed me that they had TWO pressure sores, one on each heel and told me that she was completing an incident form as one wound had gone close to the bone. She asked me to ensure that the staff on the ward dressed the wounds.\nI had to remind The nurse to dress the pressure sores\nOn ward 15 on 2 occasions our relative contracted the Norovirus, yet doctors and ward staff were frequently observed not following the correct hand hygiene procedures when they were walking on and off the ward and between rooms.\nMy sister and I complained about the standard of care in writing to the Matron and even though she met with us they later said there was no record of the complaint.\nOur relative was moved to Ward 2 Much better standard of care! They were given a chair with a leg rest and was offered a soft food menu, without us having to ask. A red tray so given for for assisted feeding.\nOn ward 2 we didn't keep detailed notes as the standard of care was good.\nWe were informed our relative would be home in a few days.\nOur relative got another infection. Doctors tried to insert a drip into but couldn't find a vein. A senior doctor told us our relative was close to death and they thought it best not to take them to intensive care and scare them by putting \"lines in the neck\" He said all of this in front of our relative who was terrified so said they didn't want to go to intensive care.\nOur relative was moved into a side room. The doctor told us they would die in a day or 2. On the first day we tried to give sips of water but the nurse said we were best not giving anything to drink and just to use swabs in the mouth. After 5 days of no food and drink, Our relative was still alive but was in a great deal of pain. My sister and I queried the withdrawal of treatment and we were asked to speak to a palliative nurse. The palliative nurse informed us that our relative was on a care pathway and this slow death was normal and could take up to 2 weeks.\nOur relative was in agonising pain for 10 days and this to our mind was caused by the Liverpool Care pathway. It got to the stage when we were unable to hug them, or comb their hair or hold their had. Our relatives body began swelling - we were not warned of this and we had to remove a ring from their finger as they were turning blue. Fluids were leaking through their hands (we were not told about this either) after 10 grueling days our relative died. This was not a painless and peaceful and kind death this was torture.\nWe sent a letter of complaint to the hospital and received an 8 page replay apologising for their shortcomings and telling us things had been put in place to prevent it happening again.\n\nHistory repeats itself:\n\nYesterday we visited a very ill friend in hospital on ward 15 and this is what we found/were told about:\nShe was left unwashed as nobody even bothered to check if she needed assistance\nHer tablets were left in a cup on the bedside table despite the fact her memory is poor and her eyesight and mobility are bad she could not reach them and did not know they were there.\nDespite lack of balance and poor mobility our friend was lying on the edge of the bed without the cot sides up\nShe was unable to use the control on the bed and the emergency call button was out of reach.\nShe was left undressed as she was unable to put her pyjama bottoms on and a member of staff had told her she could not assist but failed to get her any help.\nHer wash things and toothbrush had been left on the bed because she was unable to reach her own locker\nHer hands and fingers were swollen and her fingers were blue but no one has bothered to take off her wedding ring\nHer feet were swollen yet her legs were not raised.\nShe struggled to drink out of a glass without assistance yet no beaker has been offered.\nNurses sat at their station chatting and ignored people waiting to see them.\nMy sister and I were distraught this brought back horrific memories about the poor treatment of our relative and we have major concerns about the treatment of our friend.\nIt is obvious that the 8 page apology was merely lip service to appease us.\nNot only has this hospital failed but I feel it's complaints procedure has failed.  I now feel it has proven to be a complete waste of time.", "These are serious complaints which will be investigated by our team.\r\nPlease call us at 0151 529 3287 or email us at customerservice@aintree.nhs.uk or visit https://www.aintreehospitals.nhs.uk/PatientInformation/Patient-Advice-and-Complaints-Team/Pages/default.aspx so that we can discuss this further with you.", "Thank you once again for your comments - it is really important that we hear about the experiences of the people that use our services both good and bad and make improvements where we need to.

My complaint email has been returned undelivered by Thornbury. However, here is a copy of my complaint.\nI was referred to Thornbury hospital by my gp for a gynaecological operation. With Thornbury hospital being a private hospital, I was expecting the care to be outstanding. However, I was sorely disappointed from and I feel there were so many minor and major issues I picked up on during my experience that I doubt Thornbury wouldn't pass the friends and family test.\nI have bullet pointed some of the issues I came across:\n- at pre-op assessment, I informed the nurse that I believed my large ovarian cyst ruptured recently as I had suffered severe pain. I asked her if she could speak with the consultant regarding this, as I had had a CT scan the morning after suspected rupture. The nurse told me that there was no need, as if the cyst had ruptured, I'd be dead by now! However it was found that my cyst had indeed ruptured. My abdomen was full of blood according to my operating consultant, which has caused internal damage, which may have been minimised had the nurse not dismissed my concerns.\n-upon admission to the ward, I was informed that I would be going to theatre at midday, and I would be informed of any delays or changes. I was not collected for theatre until nearly 4pm. I was not informed of any delay or changes!\nThe practitioner who collected me for my surgery, checked my consent form with me, which is correct procedure. However at the end they asked me, do you understand any of that, because I don't!  I don't believe this sort of statement would put any patient at ease immediately prior to going to surgery.\nMy 1st night at Thornbury, I was in a lot of pain following my surgery. I asked my nurse for some analgesia. She agreed to get some strong analgesia for me. 15 minutes later a different nurse who I had not met before entered my room and gave me an injection in my leg! I can only assume this injection was an opiate, however I was not informed about what it was. However, it seemed this new nurse I had not met previously did not check my patient details, allergies, or my vital observations prior to administering the opiate drug.\nA couple of times during my stay, I accidentally set of the nurse call system, due to the placement of the button. Both times a member of staff entered my room with the statement, what do you want?  When I explained that I had not meant to call them to my room, their attitude was incredibly rude!\nUpon seeing my fluid intake and output chart the following morning, I noted the night nurse had just made up how much I drank and went to the toilet! As it was completely inaccurate, and the nurse hadn't asked me once how much I'd drank or gone to the toilet. I informed the day nurse of the inaccurate documentation that morning.\nI had an incredibly sore throat following surgery, which can be expected, however on examination of my throat, I going quite a nasty injury to the back of my throat. (For which I have pictures of. ) I informed 3 nurses about this issue, and not one of them would check the injury as requested or inform the anaesthetist of an intubation injury.\nI am prescribed medication, which I take daily. I brought this medication in with me, and informed the staff. The prescription was written up on my drug kardex. I was not once given my routine medication during my 2 night stay at Thornbury.\nThe first day following my surgery, I was given a meal. Whilst eating this meal, I realised I could taste Bell Peppers (which I am allergic to) despite having an allergy band stating this and the kitchen staff being informed of my allergy! My meal was taken away from me when I informed the staff of their error and I was given an antihistamine thankfully. However I was not offered any meal replacement!\nI found nearly all the nurse staff to be very rude when speaking to me! I was made to feel an inconvenience to them. Even my relatives commented on the rudeness of the staff!\nI could not wait to get out of Thornbury hospital! I did not feel safe or well looked after. I must say, it was an absolute stark contrast to the care I was expecting. It has taken me a month and a half to even come to terms with writing up my letter of complaint. However I feel it necessary to do so.", "Dear Tori8980,\r\nThank you for taking the time to post your feedback, which obviously makes for an upsetting read.

Suffice to say that a few years ago, I was treated in such a way by my physio that I was humiliated and degraded in the corridors of RD&E hospital.\nAt the end of that appointment, the physio said that there was no point in seeing me until I could carry out specific walking based tasks. I was actually seeing this physio for treatment of a condition, which had taken most of my leg functionality (both legs) and rendered me unable to walk without at least one crutch. \nThe physio made it perfectly clear that I should not go back until I could complete these tasks, by saying that seeing me was a waste of clinic hours that could be better used by others. This physio told me that I should just walk normally. The pain from the effort of it all reduced me to tears in that corridor. I asked for a second \"stick\" in order that I might achieve the impossible task I was being set. I suffer from somatoform pain disorder, among other things, so this was no easy feat. It was after failing at this task that the physio made it clear I should not return until I could do things their way. Wasn't that what I was there for? To get help with all that? I feel that I was effectively discharged by the physio at that appointment.\nSeveral years on, the continued unsupervised use of a crutch in my right arm has led my shoulder to serious harm; I use a wheelchair now when things are too difficult and am currently receiving treatment elsewhere for rotator cuff injury and other damage which prevents me from using my right arm much at all. I believe that I am now more disabled than I was before as a result of the failure of treatment by that physio.\nI wrote to the Chief Exec of Wonford hospital about all this, and the response is almost laughably inadequate. I have yet to see any solid proof that my complaint is being taken seriously or that any kind of investigation has taken place at all. I requested a copy of my complaint record and received copies of the letters exchanged between us and a couple of insignificant emails between staff. Not a shred of any investigation records, which indicates that the Trust's own complaints policy is not being followed and my complaint not being taken seriously. What's more, the administration/management of the hospital have taken the view that since nobody else has made a similar complaint, my experience can't have happened. The latest response suggests that trampling on someone's rights is ok if the person concerned didn't mean to. Considering the Chief Exec et al are ultimately accountable, if I prove the hospital to be in breach of my rights, I would have expected a deeper level of concern.\nI am at the stage now of deciding on the legal route or the ombudsman. I think I'll go Ombudsman first, otherwise the legal route will close off that option. I think also the CQC should be made aware of all this.\nAnyway, I just wanted to get my 'story' out there, because the hospital don't seem to be taking it seriously. Thanks for reading.", "Thank you for sharing your story and I am very sorry to hear of your concerns.

On admission found to have lost 2 units of blood and dehydrated. He was already suffering from a serious heart condition and type 2 diabetes.\nFollowing a transfusion, he was placed on a general ward, taken off a heart monitor and placed in a side room. After 2 days his blood pressure was partially restored, but continued to decline gently, despite anti-hypertensive medication being withdrawn. No record was kept of fluids in or out and, despite being diabetic, he was allowed large bars of chocolate and a mars bar. The food served was not checked against food ordered \u2013 vital in diabetes.\nThe ward seemed adequately staffed, but those on duty were in my view too busy chatting to each other, or having meetings, to efficiently monitoring patients. The hospital was using an out of date record chart (filled in sloppily) and the nursing notes were poor. He was left alone, unmonitored, in his side room for long periods, despite having attacks of breathlessness at night. After a week he was moved from to a general bay. Despite his heart condition, no room was ever found for him on the heart ward and no cause or explanation was given as to the original significant loss of blood. The ward, although clean, was littered with tatty notices and felt more like a nursery than professional hospital. The only professional looking notices were from the physiotherapy department. Doctor and nurse communication was awful.\n\nEventually the cardiology team, having fiddled with his medication, declared him fit to go home, despite the reservations of his relatives. (They had declared him fit with his first heart attack six months earlier, only for him to be re-admitted by ambulance a few days later). No proper assessment of his home circumstances was undertaken.\n\n36 hours after discharge, whilst in the care of his relatives, he suffered a further severe attack of breathlessness and his heart stopped in the ambulance. The crew were marvellous and, on admission to another hospital, he was placed in intensive care and given a blood transfusion to replace further loss of blood. At the time of writing, the other hospital has him being properly monitored and is arranging a transfer to Swansea for decent investigation as to the loss of blood.\n\nTwice in the past six months Neville Hall have discharged the same patient who nearly died days later.

She never seemed to receive the treatment she went in for and died within 4 days.\nI have started a complaint and was promised feedback etc within 2-3 weeks and it is now 4 weeks. My emails are apparently being ignored by senior staff. All emails are being forwarded to my Solicitors.", "I have a history of self-harm and suicide attempts over the past few years. It wasn't until 2014 when I took an almost fatal overdose that I was placed in the Becklin Centre as an inpatient. \nI can't remember the first 2 days because I was too 'out of it' and (as told by other service users) I kept falling over and that certain staff members were dragging me around the ward. The first day I can remember (2 days after admission), I self-harmed and the nurse who was working with me on that shift bandaged me up and talked to me until I felt stable and the urges had gone. However, she is one of very few that treated me that way. On other occasions when I self harmed, I was told that, and I quote \"you're silly and you will regret those when you're older and have to explain them to people\".\nI am very quiet and smile a lot (coping mechanism I developed during my childhood) and I felt that I wasn't listened to or taken seriously at all, even though I told them this. I felt other service users who were less patient and more loud/aggressive got what they wanted (e.g. cigarette breaks, a chat, etc) rather than those who asked politely and were told to wait several hours. For me it was usually a chat because I was distressed. Sometimes the help never came.\nOn a different, but similar note, I have noticed that several members of the Crisis Team are very rude. Recently I told them I wanted to kill myself and felt like I would do so had I left the hospital at that point. They said \"Okay\", and then discharged me. \nI then left the hospital and jumped in front of a car on a busy road. The car did a sudden stop and asked if I was okay. I said I'm fine but was crying and then he drove off. I then lay on the floor hoping a car would hit and kill me, but then a man got out of his car and picked me up, just as the police and then ambulance arrived. \nI was taken back to see the Crisis team who took 5 hours to arrive, so I was told that if I tried to leave the hospital I would be put under a Section and police were all outside the room. So I waited 5 hours, just for the crisis team nurse to say \"Hi, you're discharged. You can go now\". I felt this was very inappropriate given the state I was in. She didn't offer a chat or any other service.", "My experience of ward D1 at Royal Blackburn hospital was like a waking nightmare. My mother was treated as if she had dementia, when there was no previous diagnosis or clinical evidence. I felt that they used dementia as an excuse for the symptoms of their own failings, like her dehydration, an untreated infection, and poor nursing. \nShe was not given life-saving treatment, when there was overwhelming evidence, (subsequently revealed in her medical notes) that she had sepsis. Ward D1 is an MRSA isolation ward and early treatment of sepsis is essential. At that time, she was denied food and fluids on a bogus claim of dementia, when it is known sepsis changes cognitive function in not only elderly patients but patients of any age. \nWhen it became septic shock, the facts were covered up and in our view she was denied the care she needed, based on their supposed interest in her quality of life.\nI feel this ward really needs serious investigation as I believe that patient safety has been compromised and in my case my mother died as a result of what happened there.\nA formal investigation recently acknowledged that my mother had died of sepsis, almost three years after her death. Why did the form after her death say that the family were happy with her care, when it was known I had called in safeguarding? And why is septic shock or sepsis not mentioned on her death certificate, but instead an infection without clinical evidence? Why was sepsis never at any point mentioned to the family?\nWe are in the process of establishing a patients' forum to call for a full investigation as soon as possible into standards of care at the Royal Blackburn Hospital that have been hidden and overlooked.", "The Coventry & Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust have provided me with psychiatric care services for several years. I am informed by my treating consultant psychiatrist my mental health diagnoses include bipolar affective disorder & PTSD. I attend regular outpatient clinic appointments with consultant psychiatrist approximately once each 3 months. The community mental health team visit me at home once each fortnight however visits maybe less frequent. I am visited by named community psychiatric nurse & social worker.\nFrom late October 2013 to March 2014 I experienced mental & physical ill health \u2013 elevated mood, sleep disturbance insomnia, respiratory problems. Local community mental health team CMHT know I have experienced recurrent chronic mental ill health for several years. They visit me to monitor my mental health status to ensure I remain in satisfactory mental health living in community. My community psychiatric nurse CPN wrote to my general practitioner in January 2014. CPN recognised I had respiratory problems & compromised physical health which she attributed to my keeping pets. Community psychiatric nurse did not comment on my mental health in this letter.\nIn late March 2014 I attended appointment with independent consultant psychiatrist employed by Nottinghamshire mental health NHS Trust. A close friend accompanied me to appointment who contributed information about my past behaviour during psychiatric consultation. I have known this consultant psychiatrist several years. Independent consultant psychiatrist's report detailed that over previous 3 or 4 months I had experienced hypomanic illness. Supporting evidence: insomnia; over talkative; irritability; overspending. I purchased children's toys for my pet parrots & relatively cheap jewellery from eBay. This was first time I had purchased any items from eBay. \nIn January 2014 I took out 4 bank loans to continue to finance my spending as I had used up my savings. At the time, I did not consider how I would repay loans, I was just happy banks had allowed me to borrow money even though I was not employed. I struggle to make loan monthly repayments as I am not in paid employment. Independent consultant psychiatrist at appointment gave me advice regards management of my debt recommending I contact a debt management charity \u2013 Step change \u2013 for free advice. Independent consultant psychiatrist gave me other useful information regards management of my mental health & financial circumstances. Independent consultant psychiatrist suggested he write me a letter to give to banks detailing loans were taken out at times of mental ill health.\nI have experienced mental health difficulties which were immediately recognised & addressed by independent consultant psychiatrist. In contrast my treating psychiatric team Coventry & Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust provide me with no support regards management of my financial debt.\nAfter independent consultant psychiatrist recognised my financial difficulties were attributable to mental ill health I tried repeatedly unsuccessfully to gain support from Coventry & Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust staff. Coventry & Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust staff instructs me financial debt is (a) my responsibility, (b) loans were taken out with my consent knowledge whilst I had mental health capacity, (c) staff do not live with me so cannot control my finances (d) my situation is better than living in Syria (it is not clear how this analogy equates to my circumstances) (e) staff knew I was ordering parcels on line & considered this my normal behaviour \u2013 staff continued to state this knowing my car was full of parcels as house had become full parcels. In my view Coventry & Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust staff did not address other changes in my behaviour that they commented on such as \u2013 (a) I started smoking I do not usually smoke (b) I spent more time on line on social forums & a few gambling websites. I do not usually use gambling websites.\nI tried to gain support from Coventry & Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust staff via\n- Contact CMHT staff\n- Contact crisis team staff\n- Email consultant psychiatrist\n- Contact complaints department via phone & email\nI have received some supportive advice regards management of my situation from local Coventry police, rethink charity, step change charity, general practitioner & my Councillor which I appreciate. Otherwise my attempts to gain support are futile.\nI have requested Coventry & Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust discharge me from further follow up with psychiatric services. It is unhelpful for staff to instruct me I chose to take out significant debt which I cannot repay. I have never been in debt in my life & find my situation overwhelming, degrading. I do not want to receive any further psychiatric care from Coventry & Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust staff who I find judgmental, critical, and non-empathetic. Coventry & Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust provide a service that is unfit for purpose\nConclusion-In my view:\n\n(1) Coventry & Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust have redefined definition of hypomanic illness. Overspending is no longer a symptom of bipolar affective disorder.\n(2) Coventry & Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust practice & deliver mental health services to patients \"out on a limb\". The services delivered by Coventry & Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust vary considerably from those provided by other NHS trusts\n(3) Provision of support for mental health service users is becoming increasingly difficult to access perhaps in part due to financial cuts by coalition government", "Dear George53\r\nThank you for posting your concerns.

My story begins with me trying to access the care I needed for my medical conditions which require careful management from different clinical teams. \n\nBecause of all the difficulties I made a lot of attempts to contact the hospital to resolve crucial questions about my treatment. The hospital reacted by labelling me with \"unacceptable behaviour\" and putting in place a management plan to manage my attendance at the hospital. This letter made reference to violent and aggressive behaviour, which was completely untrue. It would be hard for me to sum up all the impact this has had on me both in terms of sorting out my treatment but also the psychological impact of it all, which is still going on for me. As a result of this management plan information was shared with other agencies including the police and I suffered from very negative attitudes and verbal intimidation from staff and others in my local area.\n\nI followed through a formal complaint and also took my case to the Ombudsman who upheld my complaint. It has been a really hard road to get there, and my story has been featured in the HSJ and also in the local press because I have been determined to make sure the issues here were addressed.\nIt transpired in all this that I was sent a letter which was not accurate by the trusts own admission. This letter was sent to other agencies and I still am feeling the impact of these actions. Also the trust restricted unfairly my access to the hospital.\n\nSo I would urge trusts to ensure that where issues arise about accessing treatment, they do not as in this case default to a process which did not address the individual circumstances and resulted in significant damage psychologically as well as great cost to the trust and time taken up with other agencies. I lost all services at Milton Keynes Hospital, all referrals made by my GP were declined, it was extremely dangerous when urgent treatment was required. I travelled miles to another hospital for emergency treatment, anyway from friends and family. My parents always supported me during these difficult times. It seemed that a standard type letter was sent out without checking it was fit for purpose.\n\nThe trust insisted there was an ongoing police investigation, after discussing my concerns I have been told by local police force this was not sure. The trust lied and caused distress. I never thought a hospital that cares for patients, could ban a patient for making complaints. The CEO said they have learnt a lot after receiving a letter from Ombudsman. I should of never been banned.\nI hope this does not happen to anyone else if they make complaint about poor care.", "Thank you.\r\nI will look forward to meeting you.\r\nKindest regards\r\nDr Ben Mearns\r\nClinical Lead for Acute & Elderly Medicine", "We are very sorry that your concerns have not been addressed to your satisfaction.

They falsified records (which they have admitted to). I received 2 statements from 2 doctors which I think are false and I think can be proven they are false.\nWe were told they would do a external independent investigation but this ended up only a review by a nurse who actually works at the hospital. In this review she finds many wrong doings but amazingly concludes she can find no negligence even though she states that the records have been falsified.\nMany more things I could go on with but will it do any good as it appears that they will tell falsehoods to back themselves up. These people who are paid to save lives and give care should be made accountable for their actions.", "Dear redrose\r\nWe were really sorry to hear about your experiences of your mother's care three years ago.

Then they were seemingly covering it up until it all came to light when medical records were accessed. The staff on the ward at the time showed no compassion, and have to be the worst people my family has had to deal with.\nThe hospital trust has definitely not showed any duty of candour to my family. They also seem to find it acceptable to have nurses shrugging shoulders when asked questions on my mam's care because they can't recall as they didn't even have time to fill in her general medical notes. \nThe trust has acknowledged approx 25 failings in my mam's care in the one week she was in hospital, for the treatable reason she was in for. Knowing a loved one's death was potentially avoidable is the hardest thing anyone has to cope with. In my opinion these people should not be allowed to be still working. Wonder how many more take the fact that someone dies naturally on face value when actually they possibly didn't.

I should be banging a drum for the excellent work done there & my dad should be a poster boy for all that is good within the NHS, instead he will be remembered by us for the mistakes and lack of care & treatment he received before he died.\n30 years ago he was given about 2 weeks to live, after a major operation & to the surprise of his surgeon (Mr Sugden, a man that our family will forever be indebted to, a man that was a God in the eyes of my father) he fully recovered. After this my dad wouldn't let a bad word be said about the NHS.\nA few years ago my father had a routine procedure, when he contracted something we were described as \"a bug in his bloodstream\". They couldn't get the infection under control & after almost 8 weeks they had to transfer him to The Southern General for 3 & 1/2 weeks then almost 3 weeks at Kirklandside Hospital. When he was discharged he needed 24 hour care & we were told he would never walk again. With the excellent care from the ISIS Team, his GP & physio we managed to get him walking about 30 steps unaided.\nFollowing another minor procedure he was sent home from Crosshouse with Campylobacter.\nHe recovered from this only to be admitted to Crosshouse with a minor turn. For some reason his medication was withheld, his heart rate spiked at 228, they gave him his meds & his heart rate normalised.\nHe was due to be discharged when he had a fall, they said he could have a brain bleed but they didn't scan or X-ray him, his was in a virtual vegetative state for 9 days, he picked up again, they said \"he might have an infection coming on\". They sent him home with E-Coli & to make things worse they sent him home with E-Coli resistant antibiotics!\nHe was readmitted & I wouldn't know where to start documenting the care & treatment (or lack of it) They failed to get the infection under control and he died. The nightmare continues, they wanted to issue a death certificate from a doctor that knew nothing about my dad & had only started that morning.

While she was walking to the door, she fell over and banged her head. I was up in her flat and saw her down on the ground after she had fallen.

If she had not fallen, she would not be there.\r\nI don't want anyone to get into trouble here but I think it's important to make sure this doesn't happen again.

The photo I have of my dad a week before he went on Brearley Ward and a few days before he died are so heartbreaking. He looks like he's been mistreated and locked away somewhere with no food. \nTo make matters worse when I went to collect his death certificate and was talking to a coroner who assisted with his post mortem we told them how my dad was 3 weeks previous. The coroner told us to go ahead with a complaint or we would live with regret. Did they see how malnourished my beautiful dad looked I wonder?", "I feel that Tameside hospital caused my pensioner mother to become so ill and immobile she has never recovered enough to return home.\nMy mother was not physically ill or injured when she went to Tameside hospital, she was suffering from a form of psychosis. Earlier in the year she had spent two months on the mental health unit with the same problem. However, she made a full recovery without additional medication and continued to attend the unit as an outpatient.\nFive months later the symptoms returned and she was badly in need of psychiatric care. In late August 2013 she rang the police who arranged for an ambulance to take her to the hospital.\nFrom the moment she entered Tameside hospital she became a victim of what I feel were serious mistakes, followed by covering up and lies. My mother became so physically ill (while I feel they were ignoring her psychosis) that she was on a medical ward for a month. Then, still unwell she was moved to Grange view which is owned and run by Tameside hospital for a further two months. \nEven then my mother was not well enough to go home. Following three months of hospitalisation, lack of exercise and an ignored fall she never regained her mobility. She lost her voice when she had an allergic reaction and that too has not returned. She became deconditioned, depressed, withdrawn and unable to communicate. She was sent to a care home, where she remains in this state of deterioration. Sadly my mother will remain there for the rest of her days.\nTameside hospital had her medical notes for reference. In addition, I gave the doctor from a&e her mother's medical history. I explained that my mother was a psychiatric patient and not physically ill. I gave details of her mother's medication including a penicillin allergy.\nHere are some examples of the unacceptable way my mother was treated by Tameside hospital:\n( a ) refused to acknowledge she was a psychiatric patient, and have the psychosis she was presenting treated.\n( b ) refused to contact her psychiatrist despite assuring me they would. (The only reason her psychiatrist became remotely involved is because I made direct contact with his office. This was when I discovered my mother was being discharged after 72 hours. I told the hospital that my mother was not leaving until she had been treated her psychosis. It was unsafe for her to leave. That was the reason she was brought to the hospital)\n( c ) informed by staff the mental health unit was full, with a waiting list of three weeks\n( d ) put her on a general medical ward, where she did not belong. Not only was she treated medically badly, she was humiliated by the situation, as some of the other patients considered her odd behaviour to be a source of amusement.\n( e ) given four consecutive doses of an antibiotic to which they knew she had an allergy.\n( f ) antibiotics were unnecessary anyway as all her tests results were clear\n( g ) collaboration by the staff who did everything possible to cover their mistakes\n( h ) failed to inform us about the mistakes, and that she had been given penicillin.\n( I ) prevented her from attending a much needed appointment with her psychiatrist.\n( j ) prevented her from seeing a social worker.\n( k ) she had a fall which left her badly bruised\nMy mother became very ill. She was immobile incontinent had breathing difficulties and lost her voice. For four days, I was frantic with worry as I watched my mother's health deteriorate and had no idea why. Yet the staff knew why, but did not say.\nI read her medical notes, and discovered my mother had been given penicillin. I confronted the nurse in charge, who refused to accept my mother was allergic to penicillin. This nurse became angry when I was said my mother was most definitely allergic to the drug, but still refused to add it to her notes. Days later when she developed a rash was this nurse was forced to admit it. However, the nurse still would not include it in her notes\nWhen I questioned the staff they denied all knowledge of her mother falling. However when she was admitted to Grange view three weeks later, the bruising was still bad enough to warrant photographs being taken by the person in charge.\nI made a formal complaint to the hospital, which was made up of twelve complaints. I also asked them to fund my mother's care costs, which is the least they could do. I was disgusted by their response and their refusal to fund my mother's care.\nThe hospital exaggerated their apologies for the minor complaints, in an attempt to overshadow the more serious matters which have been denied.\nTameside Hospital have played a huge part in my mother's quality of life being reduced to zero. She has given up, and although she is not dead, she may as well be according to her. She repeatedly tells me that she wishes she were dead.\nI do not give up easily, and will continue my plight to seek justice.", "I can't seem to get any care now from the Lister either X-ray pathology or accident and emergency.

I was alone as always when I come to the Lister and A+E - always alone - whether it's with an overdose or feeling suicidal or having cut through tendons or deep cutting my arms, I was left on a trolley last year in the corridor and was found having fallen off the high trolley onto the tiled floor fitting from a overdose by a dr who heard happened to see. I never complained, was covered in bruises in the next few days from the fall, I could have - there were enough witnesses to it and I was in Rescus for the next several hrs. I am always alone as I have no family or friends - \n\nI live alone and have never smoked never taken any illegal drugs never had any partners or any poor messed up children as I NEVER EVER want to harm ANYONE even unconsciously - I was harmed so so terribly as a child.

It was last November 2013 I finally was taken seriously enough for the trust to run an MRI Proctogram.\nThey diagnosed Mucosal Prolapse. Told me to live with it as operation would be very painful. Took second opinion at UCLH Colorectal surgeon who also seemingly misdiagnosed.\nGP referred me urgently to see the lead surgeon at St Marks Bowel hospital. Was diagnosed with full thickness rectal prolapse requiring Laparascopic ventral rectopexy. This centre of excellence coordinated several other tests which resulted in confirmation of slow transit study confirming I had an extremely slow transit of my sigmoid colon and entire colon. In order for a laparoscopic ventral rectopexy to be done they have advised not to resect my sigmoid colon as it could leak. They have also have advised to think carefully re operating with slow transit problem as operation could result in my colon becoming worse re evacuating although prolapse repaired. In addition there are other factors to beware of re bladder problems post op.\nWhy I ask myself did St Mary's Hospital fail to run extra diagnostics? Why did they fail to correctly take the initiative time to look into matters more thoroughly?\nI can honestly say that the lead surgeon St Marks knew her stuff.\nShe also commented that St Mary's may not have the necessary expertise when it comes to dealing with complex bowel problems.\nWhy is it that two NHS Colorectal surgeons failed at UCLH colorectal team and St Mary's team to correctly carry out more tests to evaluate further?\nIn my experience there was poor medical testing at St Mary's Hospital Paddington for Colorectal Imaging, poor method of examination, poor knowledge of handling my specific rectal bleeding matter and no taking the time to think out of the box re diagnosing.\nI experienced total mayhem internally re administration as I discovered after preassessment for my exploratory op Last Nov 2013. There were no preassessment papers for surgeons available on the morning of op. This all seemed very disorganised.

I am known to have bipolar affective disorder and receive psychiatric services from Coventry & Warwickshire Partnership NHS mental health trust.\n\nA little while ago I phoned West sector community mental health team CMHT. This team provide psychiatric care to me. I asked to speak to manager via mobile phone (my landline is not working currently).\nI wanted to speak to them prior to bank holiday Monday break.\n\nFinally around teatime the manager spoke to me briefly via mobile phone. They said they had been in meetings all day so could not talk to me earlier. My conversation focused entirely on why CMHT have decided staff treating me must visit me in pairs. I receive care services from social worker, community psychiatric nurse, support worker. I told manager I am not dangerous I do not carry a weapon. I feel uncomfortable knowing I can only be visited by minimum of 2 people. The visit feels formal rather then informal. In the event only one staff member is free to visit me I miss my scheduled visit from CMHT staff member.\n\nOn Friday afternoon managers reply via mobile phone perplexed me. It was a judgemental, discriminatory, unrefined, non empathetic response I received from the manager. 2 staff must visit you as staff report you give them different stories & you alter story. I asked manager what they meant. They told me you know what I mean. I asked if they meant I lied and he said yes. I told manager I didn't lie & to give me supporting evidence for their allegations together with name of staff making allegations. Manager made no response. I repeated my question & got no response. Manager then ended conversation.\nI have decided to terminate my receipt of psychiatric service provision from Coventry & Warwickshire Partnership NHS trust West sector CMHT.\nMy GP agreed tonight to provide me with community based psychiatric services. This is to replace CMHT psychiatric services.\nI have spoken to several organisations over last week in an attempt to determine my rights. Local police, local councillor, GP, RCN, A&E dept. The episode has distressed me considerably.\nI attended my local psychiatric services to obtain psychological support, general daily living skills type advice, therapeutic recommendations, specific medication related advice.\nI definitely didn't attend local psychiatric services to receive verbal abuse, false allegations & a severely heightened stress. I would have been in great difficulties if my local police had not stepped in to support me over the bank holiday weekend. I greatly appreciate the opportunity they gave me to be logical, reason & reflect with them regards current events. The police helped me put my life events in perspective.\nIn my opinion psychiatric patients should not be told they are liars, fraudulent, thief's on a friday afternoon on Friday immediately before bank holiday weekend. It is obvious mental health trained staff are going to be in short supply & GP'S on leave. This type of action is knowingly causing distress to patients; however it is also likely to increase use of A&E unit or local police service maybe psychiatric crisis team unit.", "My mum had the misfortune of spending nearly 7 weeks on ward 15.

Then all the services were cut and she stopped getting visits and the GP didnt know that all the support had stopped.\nShe has got very ill again ( last year she was in hospital 3 times). The police come. The police and the ambulance call the mental health crisis team who don't come out as they are too busy. She wont go to A&E and the police can't make her, so they have to wait for the crisis team, who don't come or leave her.\nWe are very worred and we rang Camden Council, who told us to ring the Crisis Team in Camden, who told us that as she does not have a worker or a team they will not see her. Apparently people who are very mentally ill cannot see the crisis team if do not have a community team. They know her because people keeps telling them and she has been in hospital. And she neglects herself and there were 2 fires in her home because she was very very ill.\nThe police say the crisis team refuse to come out because our neighbour refuses to work with them or mental health workers and she has complained about them.\nThe police now come and don't call them sometimes as the police say they are useless and better the police calm the situation rather than call mental health crisis teams who don't come as she then disappears.\nShe is very unsafe sometimes and is letting strangers in to her home who take her things and then she gets paranoid and refuses to let anyone in. We are neighbours and so no one listens to us. Her family say they gave up asking for help as even when she was hearing voices telling her to kill herself they contacted this mental health Trust and no one came out (this happened lots of times and when they were children trying to care for her).\nNow she is ill again. Her friend had to remove dangerous items from her flat. There are people taking advantage of her. the mental health trust know this as we know people have contacted them. The police know and say mental health services are useless. Her family think mental health services at this trust are dangerous. Camden Council know because someone in the street had to contact them to make her home /garden safe and told them she was in need of help.\nShe has tried to kill herself 3 times and nearly died on other times when too unwell to know she is unsafe.\nI feel that the crisis teams in camden and in this trust are useless and dangerous. To tell someone they have to go or take someone to A&E is appalling and dangerous and how if the police can't make her can anyone else?\nShe thinks mental health workers are trying to kill her.

It can be difficult to treat someone if they do not consent to receiving care. However, in these circumstances the Crisis Team will work with the carers, families and other professionals to arrange alternative treatment if it is required.\r\n- The crisis team will not exclude someone from care because they have made a previous complaint about services or about any individual worker.\r\n- The crisis teams work closely with the police. Should the police come across an individual who is mentally unwell and in their own home \u2013 they can make a referral to mental health servicea (including the crisis steam) who will respond to the referral. The response to these referrals is swift and we work extremely closely with the police on these issues.\r\n- It is common for neighbours to raise the alarm should they be concerned about an individual by calling the Housing Office, the police or indeed an ambulance or social services.\r\nI really hope this is helpful and please contact our teams on the numbers above.\r\nThank you\r\nKarl", "As a family, we feel totally disappointed in the Mental Health System within Foundation House, Taunton.

I was put onto a drip to try and stop my labour but after several hours I developed chest pains and so the drip was stopped. \nI was constantly monitored and that evening I went into full labour and our son was born early the next morning. The neonatal doctor and nurses were there to attempt and intubate our son but all we kept hearing was that he wasn't viable. This went on for 13 minutes and eventually the Dr and the team stopped trying. The midwife wrapped our son up and passed him to me. I could see his chest rising and falling and shouted out that he was breathing and the Dr said that he wasn't. Dr and team then left the delivery room. Myself and my husband were angry that nothing more could be done and we expressed our anger to the midwife. The midwife left us to have some private time with our son and we had to wait and watch our son die which took 50 minutes. \nDr came back into the room and told us we were very lucky that the neonatal team came to try and save our baby because at 23 weeks they usually didn't bother and then left the room. We were both in complete shock that a Dr would even say to anyone what we had just heard. When the midwife came back into the room, we told her what had been said and she seemed astonished at what was said. We left that afternoon after taking our son to the chapel. The midwives could not have done any more for us than they did. They were very competent and professional but also sympathetic. \nOn the following Monday the lady from the bereavement team came to see us and talked to us in great detail about what would now happen and the services available to us. We talked to her about our experience in the delivery suite and she seemed ashamed that that was how we had been spoken to. We wanted to put a complaint in into the way our son had been treated or not as we feel. However we were told that if we wanted to do that then the death certificate couldn't be signed and our son would have to have a post mortem, which was something I didn't want to happen. Our son was perfect and we didn't want him cut into. We had consented to umbilical testing and my placenta tested and felt that that was enough. \nIn the eyes of myself and my husband we don't think that the Dr in question had done all they could to save our son because all the doctor kept saying was he's not viable he's not viable over and over again. We have been back to see my consultant and got the results of the tests carried out on the umbilical cord and placenta. The results were they found a large blood clot in the placenta and they feel that could have started my labour off prematurely. We expressed our feelings of future pregnancies and how I would be treated and a care plan has been put in place. \nI haven't been able to do this before now as I have really struggled to come to terms with our loss and only recently, after a complete meltdown, felt I needed to do this to help me move forward. After thinking back to the beginning of my pregnancy and my first appointment with the midwife and then Dr at Chorley Hospital, I was told by the midwife that I was high risk of blood clots and would probably be put on clexane injections every day from 16 weeks. However when I went into see the Dr he said I would only need clexane injections after the birth or if I was bed ridden. So I feel that if I had the clexane injections my story might have been so different. \nI am absolutely terrified now of future pregnancies and having to go to Preston Hospital for the birth.

No one is addressing this however. \nWe have had 4 different answers from the same nurse about the same question as she actually doesn't seem to know the answer. I have also been made aware that they are short staffed to the point they can't cope. In my opinion my grandad is going through suffering he shouldn't have to if some staff did their job and took notice.", "Dear Moomin85\r\nWe are concerned to note your comments and would suggest that the family ask the ward sister to put them in contact with the Matron, who will try to resolve concerns in the first instance.", "Dear WillowTree\r\nWe understand that your mum's death was distressing for you and your family and are sorry you feel the care we gave her was not of the standard you expected of us or that we would wish to provide.\r\nAs you know, we undertook a detailed investigation into the circumstances surrounding your mum's death and we shared the results with you.

She was then referred to Stapleford Care Centre with a mental health doctor, with the Iris team being bought in for assessments on mum late last year. There was a brain scan set for the new year. The Iris team I felt created havoc with everyone, myself and my future daughter in law did most of the care for mum, the Iris team didn't complete communication book we set up, left tablets out that we had set up in blister packs etc They were forever on the phone to me contradicting each other in what I was being told. For example, I was told not to buy mum any biscuits (this is virtually all she was eating at the time, even though I provided meals, fruit etc) as not good for her. So mum then didn't eat. Then I would get another one call me, saying they'd been out and bought biscuits to encourage mum to eat. \nThese were the 'higher end' people within the team not the actual day to day carers. There were so many issues you wouldn't believe. They said mum didn't assess badly. I don't know why. One of the assessors wouldn't even let us take notes. Why not? I begged to differ as mum was not in a good way, she wasn't looking after herself in anyway whatsoever and didn't know basic things. I got a call saying they were putting a 3 wheeled walker in for mum (she had a \u2018zimmer' she didn't use) I asked them not to put it in whilst I wasn't there but to leave until I was with her to show her how to use. To help make sure she would not fall (I work full time) but they put it in anyway, with notes stuck on pictures frames saying \"Use Frame\". I was surprised they did this for a dementia patient. \nWe were on the way back from City Hospital with my father in law (who has since died) to get a call from my daughter to say the carer had contacted her (we only live across the road from my mum) and she couldn't get in. Mum had left the key in the door and she was lying on the floor in the kitchen, shouting \u2018help me'. My daughter and the carer went to a neighbour to go over to mums back garden as we pulled up. My husband broke in to get to mum, who had fallen over the walker and broken her hip.\nShe was taken by ambulance to QMC for a plate and screw operation.\nAt around the same time there was a meeting set for the results of the brain scan with the mental health doctor at Stapleford Care Centre, I had a battle for this to go ahead without mum but they agreed. Five of us went to the meeting, to be told mum had moderate to severe vascular dementia, but as she was now in hospital, she would be taken off their assessment. Anyway, mum's hip was operated on but her mind seemed worse, the nurses at QMC spoke with me, mum was walking a little but doing things like switching all the lights off in the ward. I appreciate physical wards are not set for dementia patients. They explained the best thing for the best outcome would be rehabilitation at Lings Bar hospital. \nMum went to Lings Bar Hospital. Well, I don't know where to start and rehabilitation is not the word I would use. Mum was left sat in a chair with a buzzer under her bottom that went off every time she moved. She went downhill quite badly. She had severe leg pain which they scanned as concerned for  DVT but nothing on scan and so nothing done. They are supposed to elevate leg but every time we went (one of us daily) it wasn't. An assessment was done there without them saying anything to me as I found a brown envelope with details in it. Mum had been hiding tablets left with her, we said this to the staff many times. I continually got calls off the staff at Lings Bar saying they couldn't settle mum. This was often late in the evening and asked me if I would speak with her. I did but it didn't help as mum needs to have her hand held and see people. She also had a fall there but not given much info except a call to say fallen but OK. \nOne day I received a voicemail at 7. 30am whilst at work saying mum was aggressive and abusive and could I go and sit with her as they couldn't get their rounds done as having to spend time sitting with mum.  I was appalled to hear this message and tried calling back but to no avail as I couldn't leave work as it was my busiest day. The day before when I went to visit, they were all talking at the nurses' desk while mum was shouting for the toilet and she was ignored. So I took her myself.\nSeveral meetings were called then cancelled; eventually there was a full team multidisciplinary meeting. At this meeting the physio, a ward manager, the occupational therapist (who I had not seen or spoken with), a social worker from Lings Bar who had been given mums case on the day. \nI was in despair as six of us went up for this meeting and in my opinion no-one would listen to what we were saying, the outcome being mum couldn't come home with care as it would not be safe (I do agree on that point) but they said residential care only. I strongly disagreed with this as mum was on about her fourth water infection by this point. Her mental state seemed affected by this and she wasn't walking at all. They had not allowed her to even try to walk. She hid her tablets and wasn't eating. \nI felt I was not listened to and it broke my heart. I said I wanted mum in the right place and a forever home. I didn't want her moving again a month down the line. I was told that wouldn't happen. I was then left to tell mum myself what was happening. I felt it was as if the staff were then pushing to get her off the ward. We felt very pressured and we were told to go and look at residential care homes. We knew nothing and were just given a booklet! \nThe first home we went to was lovely but it was beyond our means (mum is not self-funding). I spoke with the social worker who said the home who refused her would not speak with him or the ward as to why they refused mum, so he had nothing to go on.\nAfter several calls I was told to go and look at a home the social worker had called and, if seemed nice, they would get an assessment done. We went the next morning and they assessed her that day and mum moved in. The care home called to say mum had eaten and walked. All seemed OK but I was concerned as mum didn't settle at all, she didn't seem to fit in. \nAt the beginning of the following month mum seemed again to get worse. She was not sleeping, was  very agitated and everyone was concerned. The care home said they would speak with her GP after the bank holiday. I received a call from the care home, they had the mental health doctor from Stapleford Care Centre to see mum, who had put her on a lot of medication and were sending her to hospital. I asked where and was put on to speak with the mental health doctor (this is not mums GP)who said she was going to King's Mill in Mansfield. I asked why there and was told there were no beds at the City Hospital assessment unit. I said I didn't want her going that far away as we live in Chilwell and that City Hospital would be difficult enough without being in Mansfield especially as hospitals have restricted times. The mental health doctor said it might be better if you didn't see her. I could not believe it at all. I lived across the road from my mum and saw and cared for her virtually every day until her fall at home. Then between us someone went every day to the hospital and the care home and to be told that.\nI said I wasn't having mum in there at all and the doctor said what are you going to do about it? I was so upset. We stopped our conversation and about an hour later I had a call from the care home that they had spoken with mums own GP and she was going to Bestwood Ward, in the St Francis Unit that evening. Mum went there quite late that night. Mum was assessed and taken off some medication. Obviously this is a secure unit and there are still assessments taking place between the mental health team and the mental incapacity team. Speaking with several members of staff I now know that what I felt wasn't right, really wasn't right.\nMum has been let down so badly. No wonder she is so bad as she had been moved 4 times in 10 weeks. We went to visit mum and were called in to see the consultant doctor of Bestwood Ward, along with another doctor, a nurse and someone else. They were trying to explain about getting legality behind mum for keeping her there and had altered her medication to try and calm her without over-sedation. However she now had an irregular heartbeat and there were concerns as to how to treat her with weighing up risk of heart problem against risk of stroke if warfarin was used. It is heart breaking.\nWhilst at Bestwood there someone came who was a 'best interest assessor' to try and get a DOLS act behind mum to keep her there legally. I did agree with this. They asked me all about what has been going off. It appears mum should have gone to B47 of QMC after her operation as this is a specific dementia ward at QMC, and that Lings Bar do not have sufficient dementia specialists to deal well with dementia patients. She asked me about the meetings and who attended. I told the DOLS assessor that the social worker was and what I had heard from them. I said I hadn't heard meeting was confirmed or not, I told her the name of the social worker that the mental health assessor thought it would be. The DOLS representative gave me lots of great advise and advised me to speak up and find out. \nI still hadn't heard anything at all so I called the number I had been given from the mental health assessor which is a unit for the NHS in Mansfield. I asked for the person who was not there so I left a message. I heard nothing so called back and someone answered who again I explained to that I needed to know about a social worker and if meeting was happening or not as I needed to book time off work. They gave me a mobile number for the person. I called it, for the mobile number to have been changed. I called the new number and left a message saying I needed information (as above). I received a call back from this person saying, meeting still not confirmed, it wasn't the social worker who they thought it would be but they didn't know who it was or even if there was one.\nAgain I was stressed and I was very concerned this was going just how the bad meeting was at Lings Bar and I needed time off work to book. This went on for a while until I said I wasn't at all happy and really concerned for mum's outcome yet again and I was getting frustrated. They were aware of what we had been through before. They gave me the number for Nottinghamshire County Council adult social services and told me to call them on Thursday. I called Thursday and was passed around and around, as no one knew anything. \nI left a message for someone to call me back \u2013 the title of this post was the 'best interest assessor' who I knew wasn't the correct person. They called me back and I apologised that it had ended up at their door as I knew it wasn't their responsibility. They checked all the notes etc and said the referral had gone to Broxtowe but no social worker as yet assigned and they believed that they weren't given cases until a Tuesday and this is when mums meeting was supposed to be. They said they could not however guarantee anything would be done but the said they hoped for my sake that it would. But safeguarding patients take priority (I do understand this). Hence the meeting did not take place that week. \nBestwood and assessors have all said mum will not be going back to the care home she was in as it wouldn't be suitable, however payment would still be made to them until the change of home was made, so mum will still be paying her big chunk too. Nottinghamshire Council told me the contract was between them and the care home and therefore I couldn't cancel it and they couldn't until someone higher told them to. All this when where she is I cannot get often enough in their visiting times and have to pay laundry service for her clothes at \u00a310 a time (every 2 days) whilst it seems to me the care home is sitting pretty. I can only get 2 sometimes 3 times a week without booking time off work.\nI feel so guilty that mum has gone through this. She hasn't had the chance to settle anywhere whatsoever and there will be another move soon. I really could cry for how much mum has had to go through. I would do anything for my mum, I don't have much money, I haven't got a loud voice and I am now in despair for my mum. It just seems (in our case anyway) that mental health is not important. My father in law who recently passed away had a physical health problem and has had the best of care in comparison. It really is so unfair.\nBestwood ward is fantastic, the staff know their patients and they communicate, but I understand this ward, along with Daybrook, is closing in about 4 weeks. The aim is to set up more care in the community by IRIS teams. I hope no one ever has such a bad experience as mum has been put through with the Iris Team and all that followed.\nOn a plus note, this evening I have received a call from a social worker for mum, lots of advise and support, the care home will be cancelled and have meeting set.\nSo hoping mum can now have the proper care she deserves and a forever home.\n", "So I was bang on my due date with my second baby when I went into labour, my contractions were painful and very regular getting progressively closer. I went into the hospital at 4 cm dilated (I managed to hold out to 7 cm with my first baby), the pain was just too intense. I was examined and given 2 paracetamol, upon explaining to the midwife that I needed something stronger she just looked at me and said that it was too early. \n15 minutes later and more very painful very regular contractions I buzzed again, it took ages for anyone to respond eventually a healthcare assistant attended and I asked for some pain relief, she explained they were short staffed and went to find a midwife. The same midwife attended and said my labour wasn't progressed enough to have gas and air, she did not examine me and left. \n20 minutes later in tears and scared I buzzed again, I was practically screaming and I begged for pethidine or anything they could give me I just needed something. She said she'd give me gas and air and would go get some pethidine as well but would need another midwife to sign for it. \nEventually she came back and they gave me the pethidine, immediately afterwards I started to push, she was washing her hands and I told her I needed to push. She told me not to be silly and at this point I lost my temper, I told her I was pushing and I could not stop it, low and behold she examined me (only the second time since arriving on the labour ward) and I was ready to push but my babies head had come down behind the cervix leading to the midwife having to physically push my babies head back up the birth canal and manoeuvre it in front of the cervix, the pethidine had not taken effect yet!\nIt was during this time the midwife told me to 'be quiet and shut up' 4 contractions later my 9lb 7oz baby was on my chest and I was in complete shock. A family member of mine is a midwife but had opted against being around for the birth in case of complications, she came in about 15 minutes after I had delivered, she was holding the baby talking to my husband and I was on the phone to my mother, I suddenly felt wet and warm gushing from my vagina. I ended the phone conversation and told my family member I thought I was bleeding, she pulled back the sheets and pulled the emergency buzzer, I was then surrounded by lots of people having injections in my legs, medication pushed up my bottom, cannula in both hands and my stomach massaged frantically. I remember the pad under me being removed and the blood pored into a jug in the bathroom, I was in complete shock and shaking. \nOnce the bleeding stopped the medical team disappeared as fast as they had arrived leaving me with my new baby and husband and feeling like crap. I was left in that room until morning when I insisted that I get moved to the midwife led unit in Alnwick where I would be given some TLC. \nThe birth has traumatised me I am due to give birth to my 3rd child in 7 weeks and I am so scared that the same thing will happen, I thought I had dealt with how the birth had left me but I obviously haven't.", "Dear Madam,\r\nCan I begin by saying how extremely sorry and saddened I am that you have had this experience during the birth of your second baby.

You can contact us via PALS@ngh.nhs.uk.", "What I am about to tell you, you may find upsetting. But this is what has happened to me. It may not be the experience of others and if you have had a good experience in a crisis, I am sure you can share it in the workshops this afternoon. If by what I say, I may trigger you then this is not my intention please try and not judge me too harshly and please don't tell me that I did these things just to be an attention seeker- there are better ways to get attention, I can tell you, than trying to kill yourself.\nI spent my working life as a probation officer. Following an assault in Cyprus I developed post-traumatic stress disorder which then developed into a deep depression, and since then I have been diagnosed with rapid cycling bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder. I am, what you might call, a repeat offender, in that in the last 13 years I have experienced numerous suicidal crises. I want to give you a composite of what happens if you have a mental health crisis.\nSo\u2026. You may have been dealing with suicidal thoughts for some time and have tried to keep yourself safe using various means, like distraction, being around others, going to public places, taking tranquillisers and sleeping tablets. But what if all the tablets have been used up and its night and you can't go anywhere to be safe? There may come a time when your energy to fight these thoughts is so low you don't think you can resist acting on the thoughts anymore. In the past when I have got to this point I have started drinking alcohol with a wish to either pass out unconscious or die. Because If I can't pass out I will not care enough to keep fighting the thoughts and can try and kill myself. As you will \u201clet my god decide if I should live or die\u201d, a form of Russian roulette with the fates. Some of my suicidal acts have been planned at other times impulsive. I am not proud of what I have done, as after each attempt I have felt feel humiliated, embarrassed and ashamed. I have caused pain for my friends who have felt helpless, confused, powerless, frustrated and angry.\nWhen you try to kill yourself you are not thinking of the consequences, you just want out of life. At times, you may be aware that you are a danger to yourself. Once when I asked for help to keep me safe, my social worker asked the crisis team to come over, they said they could not come to my home until the next day at noon, I did everything I could to stay safe for those 24 hours. When the crisis team arrived I said I was not safe, I had thought of killing myself and not wanting to burden others with my cat, I said I had even thought of killing my cat. This thought scared me and I did not want to kill my beloved pet. The response I got from the man who was there was that he shouted at me that I was \u201cselfish\u201d. I said I was not selfish, if I was selfish, I would have just done it and not thought of the pain I would cause others.\nThey told me that I didn't need to be in hospital and tried to dissuade me from asking any more, so I called my support worker, who told them I had been very depressed and would never normally ask to be hospitalised and that I needed to be in hospital, that I was NOT safe. They told her I would not be taken to hospital and besides there were no beds available anyway, but that they were planning to call the RSPCA to have my cat taken away. They were more concerned with the welfare of my cat than my welfare, how ironic!\nAnother time when I knew I was at risk I phoned the crisis team. I said \u201cI am at risk and need to be in hospital\u201d they said to take a tranquilliser and phone them back in 5 hours if it did not work. Well 5 hours is long time to wait if you're suicidal. But I did phone them, (after all I always keep my promises) and told them I had already taken an anticoagulant and cut myself. They did nothing. They did not even call the police to do a welfare check. I did not die as you can see but only because I had not waited long enough for the anti-coagulate to work.\nAnother time I told my community psychiatric nurse, I needed a respite bed, somewhere to be safe, where I could talk or just be. But the only respite bed in Suffolk was booked up months in advance.\nSo, you're in crisis, you've been fighting the thoughts of killing yourself all day and it gets to the evening. Your community psychiatric nurse has told you to phone the crisis team when you're at substantial risk. When I have done this in the past some of their comments such as \u201cgo have a cup of tea, a bath, go for a walk, watch TV, \u201d have only brought me more frustration and anger. This escalates the situation. You phone the Samaritans, or you may call the crisis team again and they say \u201cI'm sorry I only have a few minutes to talk to you as I have an assessment to do here at the hospital, so put your worries in an imaginary box and you'll feel better\u201d.\nYou may call the Samaritans again, who are really lovely people, but they can't give you advice. You don't want to call friends because you don't want to burden them or worry them, besides it's in the middle of the night. You already feel such a worthless human being, not even worthy enough to breathe another person's air. You are desperate and so you attempt to take your life, you've had enough, you just want out. You may be discovered by accident, or have a rational, lucid moment and call for help, you may wake up alive, and either way\u2026 other people now know.\nYour friends might try and persuade you to go to accident and emergency. If they can't persuade you, they might call the police to do a \u2018welfare check'. You might be able to persuade the police you're safe.\nOr your friend might take you to accident and emergency where you're put in a room. Your friend can't cope, your banging your head literally against the wall. The Sister in charge of Accident and emergency department is insisting the mental health team attend but they say to her \u201cput her in the cells, she is drunk and only has herself to blame\u201d. The Sister is refusing to call the police, she won't let a mentally unwell person be put in the cells. Your friend might plead and beg for you to be sedated but you're not. Because you need to see the crisis team first.\nYou might phone the crisis team and if you have already hurt yourself they may send an ambulance or tell you to get yourself to accident and emergency (I have tried this before when in a taxi and tried to jump out of it, my friend stopped me). You might even be persuaded by the Samaritans for them to call an ambulance. Your neighbour may have seen you in the street and called an ambulance, and they may wait for an hour and a half for one to arrive.\nOnce you get to accident and emergency you may be seen by a doctor who says \u201cdo you feel hopeless and helpless\u201d, you say \u201cno\u201d, because once you get released you plan to finish the job. But you can't go once the doctor has seen you, as you have to wait to see the mental health team, this can take hours. The longest period I had to wait was 12 hours when the mental health team \u201cforgot\u201d I was there, but it can take usually up to 6 hours. You are not given any tranquillising medication while you wait so your desperation and agitation increase, the stress may cause you to start hallucinating.\nSomeone once told me they passed out from taking an overdose and a nurse told their friend \u201cwell what did she expect she took the tablets she will wake up eventually\u201d. You wake up - still no assessment- you have a panic attack and run away. Or your friend is told that they can go, as you will be admitted to psyche ward, and they go, and you're on your own, waiting and waiting, you get frightened you, run away. Or you may be guarded by security staff, who get annoyed by babysitting \u201cyet another mental health case\u201d. You may be left in cubicles and surrounded by over stimulating beep sounds and the hustle and bustle of a busy department you can't cope with the noise so you, run away.\nYou may see the mental health team after a 6 hour wait, you are stammering and can't get the words out, they say \u201cif you can't speak to us properly, we won't talk to you\u201d- your crying, you run away. The mental health team may guilt-trip you into going home because\u201d your cats not fed\u201d, or they say \u201cyou self-manage so well\u201d.\nAccident and emergency staff may come up to you and berate the mental health team for taking so long. You know you're making them frustrated. You feel guilty so you, run away.\nYou may be guarded by the hospital staff waiting for the mental health team, you over hear one nurse say to another \u201cI've been brought down from theatre to do this stint\u201d, you feel so guilty that you have caused this that you, run away. You might be prevented from leaving by accident and emergency staff, so you wait some more and more and more. You can't bear it anymore, you wait for their back to be turned and you, run away.\nIF you run away, the accident and emergency staff have no option but to call the police, it's their policy. En route to your home, you may have hid in peoples gardens so that you won't be caught. If you continue to hide in peoples gardens the police will put up a helicopter to search for you. So you go home.\nThe police arrive at your house and try and persuade you to open the door. Eventually they threaten to break down your door. You don't want to upset your landlord by the damage to the door, so you let the police in. They might act kindly towards you or they may, out of frustration, start phoning randomly the contacts in your phone, telling people that you have not seen for years, that you're suicidal. They may contact the mental health team who tell them your sister is your next of kin. If, for example, your sister doesn't pick up the phone (after all it is 2. 30 in the morning), they will go and wake her up. She will be angry, and phone you the next day to tell you that the \u201cpolice have better things to do than waste their time on you, when they could be catching criminals\u201d, she never speaks to you again.\nThe police, at your home, may try to convince you to go to the hospital. They call an ambulance, all your meds are taken out of your house, your keys, phone and your cigarettes. You're so afraid that in the ambulance you stand up to make to jump out the back. The Paramedics say, \u201cKeep breaking sharply that will make her sit down\u201d, they keep calling you Catherine, but your name now sounds like \u201ccathy run\u201d. So you manage to jump out of the moving ambulance and the police car is following. They jump on you and hand cuff you and put you back into the ambulance. You arrive in accident and emergency, in handcuffs, embarrassed, feeling like a criminal.\nOr the police, at your home, may try to persuade you to walk outside your home, then carry out a section 136, (you can't be sect 136 at home). They put you in the police car. They call the mental health team who say \u201cif she has drunk alcohol we won't see her till she is alcohol free\u201d so the disgruntled police have no option but to take you to the police cells.\nAt the cells you get searched, have your personal items removed and put in a cell with a mattress on the floor. If the police man is a friend you went to school with, they may sit at the door of the cell talking to you kindly, telling you to ignore the voices and making conversation to distract you from the voices in your head that are telling you \u201cyou should be dead, you failed, next time hang yourself\u201d. You will then be breathalysed repeated until free of alcohol then, 6 hours later, you are taken to the section 136 suite at the woodlands unit in the hospital.\nYou then have to wait again, without medication, for the assessment team. You may have headache but no one will give you Paracetamol, there is no doctor to prescribe it. You don't get offered a drink and you are put into a brightly lit room that is over heated. No one comes to talk to you to ask you why you tried to kill yourself. You may overhear the lone nurse there, telling their colleagues on the phone, \u201d she is agitated but ok\u201d. You try and keep it together, as so far you've been treated like a criminal and just want to get home. You ask if you can have a drink. The nurse sighs as if you're a nuisance and gets you a drink of water, you wait for the assessment team. You ask if you can go to a low lit room because the bright lights and extreme heat are making you feel worse, so they put you in a freezing cold bedroom next door. You try and calm down, your shaking now with the cold and come out to ask for a hot drink You are tutted at by the nurse who reluctantly makes you a hot drink. Its now3. 30am. You're exhausted, you just want to get home, get to your sedating meds. You may ask for your property as you don't know what you have got. Cigarettes? \u201cWe can't give you the package with your property in it\u201d says the nurse.\nThe mental health assessment team arrive and ask you questions that make you angry. You try and convince them you're safe to go home. You're so tired and agitated. They offer you the home treatment team but they can't explain what the home treatment team will do for you. They let you go, but you have to ask them if they can call for a taxi as you have no phone.\nSometimes if you ask for it, the taxi can be paid on account or if not offered it, you walk home. You may have to break into your home or wake your neighbour, up who has a key to the house. It's now 4am and they are not best pleased.\nYou get home but they have taken all your meds, so you can't help yourself calm down. You want to phone the hospital for your property but the number is in the mobile that you can't find because they didn't tell you they took it. You try and look for your cigarettes but they didn't tell you they took them too. You might be lucky and have another phone at home and you might be lucky if the hospital security guard brings round your property at 5am, or, you might be unlucky and never get your property back.\nOn another occasion when taken to the 136 suite at Woodlands there were no mental health staff available. The police said as there were no staff, I needed to be taken to the cells. I begged them not to take me, so they waited with me in the 136 suite until a mental health worker was free. It took hours.\nIf you wake up alive on the medical assessment ward or the surgical ward, you may ask to be NFR (not for resuscitation). The Doctor will put you on 72 hour section and then you will be watched constantly by a nurse, who is very kind and will say things like \u201cwhy did you try and kill yourself you have so much to live for\u201d or, \u201conly god should take a life\u201d, or \u201cwhat will your friends think had you succeeded, they would have been devastated\u201d, you persuade the nurses that you were foolish, you did a stupid thing and wont to it again, you need to make THEM feel better.\nYou may be seen by a psychiatrist who suggests you need to go into hospital you tell him \u201cbut I have a borderline diagnosis my experience is they won't put you in hospital\u201d, he says \u201cyes but you do have a bipolar diagnosis and you should be there, but the crisis team have to see you first\u201d. They (the mental health crisis team) come and guilt trip you into going home, \u201cwell your cats not been fed for over 24hours now and you do have an appointment with your G. P. tomorrow which you should keep\u201d. Your carer or friend may phone them and say \u201cshe is not safe, don't discharge her\u201d. But because you feel so guilty that the cats not been fed, and made to feel a nuisance, you tell them you will go home.\nThey may offer you a crisis bed but that would only be for 2 nights, that's 30 hours, and they tell you you won't have your treatment reviewed there. The carer is told \u201c\u201dwell Cathy has chosen to go home and only SHE is responsible for her safety\u201d. The carer is left feeling angry, worried and frustrated.\nWhen you wake up alive in the surgical ward you might not have your clothes on, you're in a hospital gown, and you don't have any property. You can't phone someone because you have no phone and can't remember the numbers on it. The medical ward may say that you are medically fit to be discharged. You go home in hospital scrubs with a bag of blood clotted, cut up clothes and no shoes or socks. You call the Freephone number at the hospital for a taxi, and because you have no money on you, the taxi driver follows you into your house for his money. You have no meds, they've been taken by the ambulance. Your traumatised, you clean up the blood stained carpet and cry.\nIf you have tried to kill yourself in a public place, the police may section you. If the police have sectioned 136 you, the police may have to wait for you to be medically fit to be discharged, as the mental health team won't see you until your medically fit to be discharged.\nThe police may have to change shifts 3 times for the length of time it takes for them to be able to hand your care over to the mental health services. It's been over 14 hours now that they have had to \u201cbabysit\u201d you. You are awake the whole time and hallucinating. They may be kind to you, but very frustrated by having to be with you. You pick up on this and feel very guilty.\nAt Accident and Emergency you may be placed in cubicles and only feel safe laying or kneeling on the floor, this way you can't sink any lower. Someone passes the cubicles and remarks to the police officer sitting outside \u201csomeone should tell her meccas the other way\u201d. The doctor arrives, you can't get up from the floor. The police officer shouts at you to get up as the doctor is here. You can't, only the floor is safe and cool, so she grabs the back of your collar and drags you up.\nOne day I phoned the access and assessment team for medication advice, and no one answered so I left a message on the answer phone. They did not phone back. After 45 minutes I called 111. It says on the poster \u2018if you need urgent advice but it's not an emergency call 111' - Don't phone 111 if you're in a crisis and only need medication advice. If they ask you why you want medication advice and you say you are having suicidal thoughts and just need to know how much more anti-psychotic or tranquilliser you can take, don't phone 111. Because they will always send an ambulance, even though you tell them you don't want or need one. The ambulance arrives, the first responder arrives, and the police arrive. You are telling them all you just need medication advice and don't need to go to hospital. They will tell you their job is only to get you to hospital. You go to hospital in the police car and sit in the waiting room flanked by two police officers. Everyone in the waiting room is staring at you, your stress levels have gone up to such a point you become delusional and start hallucinating. You think you have been brought to the hospital to heal the sick. The police leave. There are too many people to heal so what do I do\u2026yeah your right. YOU RUN AWAY.\nSo what has helped me keep alive your probably asking.\n1. The Samaritans, they will listen, and offer to phone you back in an hour or the next day. If the local office is open they will tell you that you can go down there and meet someone face to face.\n2. The police, who sit with you while you wait, who want to help, but they are not social workers or doctors or mental health professionals. There are the kind ones, like my old school friend who talked to me, persuaded me to get in the ambulance, gave me a cigarette and told me that I wasn't wasting their time.\n3. My support worker, who says things like \u201cwell you can't kill yourself you need to sign my time sheets on Monday\u2026\u201d and my friends who remove the knives and pills from the house.\n4. My reasons to live list compiled when I am well. Those things that I have not yet done.\n5. Medication. Many a time I've taken sleeping tablets and tranquillisers to knock me out and provide the respite from the thoughts that only sleep can bring.\n6. My GP who shows care and empathy, never judges me, and wants for me to get well. Who will see me urgently and frequently, or his colleagues who will phone me when he is not there to say they are concerned about me.\nBUT there are those nights when, alone, frightened and terrified that you may not resist the urge any more\u2026 there are\u2026\u2026\u2026 those nights\u2026\n", "Apparent lack of care and many errors resulted in tragedy.

The ambulance paramedics were brilliant & they assessed my mum quickly & determined she needed to go to hospital. We got to hospital in the morning (8am) & were there most of the day while they ran tests. They then wanted to discharge my mum &, as I was helping her dress, she collapsed into my arms. My sister told the consultant that she wasn't happy about mum being discharged & they said she needed a drip. \nShe rallied & we took her home.\nHowever she continued to be very unwell overnight & so we took her to our GP & told her what had happened at the hospital. My mother had extremely low blood pressure & the GP phoned the hospital & virtually had to beg them to see her as they didn't seem to want to know. The GP argued it was a failed discharge. \nWe took my mum back to A&E and the doctor we saw seemed very dismissive, saying that if it wasn't for the fact my mum was in the day before, they would be sending her home. \nMy mum by this point had yellow eyes which even I had noticed. I ended up telling the doctor that I lived with my mother & even though I was not a doctor even I could see she was very ill & could they humour me by taking her in. The doctor reluctantly admitted my mum who deteriorated overnight. \nIt turns out she actually had gallstones trapped in her bile ducts & sepsis & was seriously ill. Even though I was very disappointed with her treatment in A&E, & apart from one really rude member of staff in the Acute Medical Ward, I could not fault the treatment of the staff on level 9 digestive diseases where even the consultant came in on his day off to operate on my mum. \nShe has since made a complete recovery despite her treatment in A&E and the fact that if they had sent her home I think she may have died.", "Gave birth to my third son at 7. 01pm, my husband was not given the option to hold his new son and told he had to leave by 7. 30pm.

Next morning when the midwife/nurse done her rounds when she realised I was bottle feeding she replied oh you don't matter and turned her back on me. My notes were never transferred from labour ward so I was not discharged until late afternoon when they eventually found my notes. At home it was becoming more painful to urinate and felt like something was hanging out.. very scary. My husband passed a mirror and I found a wad of gauze stuck inside me from the stitches the night before. Absolutely disgusting that it had been left there and how dangerous it could have been if I had not found it. I told the community midwife when she visited and she said she would speak to the sister on ward but that was all I ever heard.\nI'm currently due my 4th baby in feb 2015 & am refusing a hospital birth as my last was so horrendous.

The services you refer to are not run by us, but by Coventry and Warwickshire, so I am afraid we cannot respond to the points you have made.\r\nWe wish you well for your future and your ongoing care and treatment.\r\nNottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust", "Since writing my last story which refers to events of last year I have again been seriously unwell and have again been refused access to out of hours mental health services and the only reason I was in a better position to deal with this relapse than I was that last year I took matters into my own hands and made a medication crisis plan with the head of pharmacy in a meeting with her in July last year which I set up myself. Without this 45 minute meeting I would have been in exactly the same position as I was a year ago and probably would have ended being sectioned again.\n\nI recently I walked out of a meeting with a social worker when he told me he had assessed me as having no need of social work and in a crisis I could access the crisis team. This social worker has written an assessment that says many things that are simply untrue as he did not know me so did not know how I present as unwell and it seems to me has been highly selective in what he chose to include in his assessment. He also begins by saying that there are no capacity issues but he does not say how he knows this. I did not understand that what he was doing was an assessment as at the time I was being sent appointment letters I was actually too unwell to be able to read or retain any information so all I could do was look at the information in bold which gave the time and the name and turned up at this time. \n\nAlso at my appointment with the consultant at which he was present and was the first time I met him I was told that we would be working together on a care plan and this is also what it says the in letter to my GP. I think I have right to be confused that he then told me what he was doing was an assessment. No one has worked with me on a care plan since I wrote my first story, despite the fact that under the Welsh assembly measure I have a legal right to a care plan. My advocate has been faxed a copy of a document that is supposedly my care plan, however it is complete blank apart from 2 pieces of information, one of them being my current dose of mediation which is already out of date. Although producing a blank document may in some sense satisfy the legal requirement this is hardly in the spirit of the measure.\n\nAt the appointment where I first met this social worker I told my consultant clearly that I had needed to implement the crisis plan I had made with the head of pharmacy and was therefore on the maximum dose of medication and not only that I had also needed the maximum dose of lorazapam. I thought giving a consultant psychiatrist this information would be enough for her to realise that I was seriously unwell. Apparently not as she did not offer me a follow up appointment simply telling me that I was doing very well. In all my subsequent contact with the social worker I assumed that he knew I was seriously unwell and dealing with a psychosis however when I spoke to him on the phone following a terrifying bank holiday weekend during which I had started to get insight into the fact that he I had been paranoid and hearing voices he told me that I had been completely well while I had been under their team. This made me feel even worse to realise that they as a team had not picked up anything that had actually been happening to me and made me feel even more frightened. \n\nI found the phone call completely unhelpful so I went to the team to try and see the duty worker even though at the beginning of my psychosis the lead CPN had ordered me to leave the building when he and a member of his team had been unable to even introduce themselves without resorting to rude bullying tactics which I have complained to the nursing and midwifery council about since they frightened me so much when I was already unwell. And they went on to deny me access to the crisis team that day but they did not actually know what was happening to me as as I have said they were not even to able to introduce themselves.\n\nI was denied to the duty worker on the occasion after the bank holiday being told she was dealing with an emergency. I was not told that I could wait. I would have accepted that I might need to wait a long time and that she might not have much time but I was flatly refused access and only offered another phone call with the social worker who I had already found completely unhelpful and felt really let down that he had not understood that I was unwell in any of my previous contact with him.\nI have also been to A and E twice during this last relapse. I was trying to be very clear with professionals about what I could and could not deal with. I was having serve short term memory problems which is something that happened to me for the first time last year. This has serious implication for how I can deal with a relapse as with this problems it is very difficult for me to manage my medication safely myself.\n\nOn the first occasion I had been forced to call an ambulance as my phone call to the GP out of hours service had resulted in them saying that if I could accept a call back due to the fact that my phone was faulty I could not access their service. I tried to ask if they could send a taxi for me to attend their service in person but they refused saying they did not have the authority to do this. I tried to ask them to go the person with that authority to ask them but t hey refused leaving me no option then accept of calling an ambulance.\n\nThe paramedics were extremely rude, hostile and unhelpful. They could have helped me resolve the problem in my home if they had been prepared to be kind and calm. They could have helped me locate my medication and sort out what I had taken and what I had not. Instead they were rude and bulling and angry with me for calling an ambulance and wasting money. As I have already explained I was forced into doing this. They told me there was nothing they could do as there were other places for people like me and if they took me to A and E there was nothing they could do for me there and they would just send me home. This is not true that there are other places for people like me, this an offensive, stigmatising and degrading way to talk to a mentally ill person. We still do access the health service in the same way as everyone else, through GPs and A and E. I waited for hours in a private room and I did feel calmer and safer that I handed over all my medication and although I would have to wait I thought I would get appropriate help. When I did see a doctor he told me all he could do was send me home. I was alone and very ill. Having waited that long why did he not refer to he duty psychiatrist? He was simply confirming what the paramedics had said that all they would do was send me home. How on earth is someone in my position supposed to get help? I was then supposed to wait for a taxi but I found the environment I had to wait in too chaotic and scary so I said I would walk home as by that time it had started to get light. However I was not really safe on my own and a very good friend who gets up early drove to a bus stop and came and took me home and helped me phone the GP when they were open.\n\nThe second occasion it was the out of hour GP who arranged an ambulance as I had taken an accidental overdose which I think is evidence of how hard I was finding it to mange this situation myself which by that point I think had gone on for over 2 months. On that occasion the paramedics, both female was totally professional and kind and helpful. They told me that if they took me to A and E they could try and arrange for me to wait in a private room which is what I had done on the previous occasion. I understood they could not guarantee this as many things can be happening in A and E but they said it was actually fairly quiet for a Saturday night.\nThe room turned out not to be available but I agreed to wait as the waiting area at that point was empty. I wanted and saw a male nurse and did my best to explain things to him. I found him hostile for no reason. He asked for the name of my next kin which I gave him along with a comment because my dad has the same name as a famous person and I wanted to clarify that I had given the correct name. His response was to ask me very coldly the same question again. I had already answered and I found this very intimidating.\n\nI waited again but other people were now waiting as well and because I was still unwell which is one reason why I had made the mistake with my medication I found it harder to wait and the other people asked me questions like how long had I been waiting and I found it hard to interact with strangers in the state I was in. I then got called by a female nurse who said she was doing to do a heart trace. Her manner was bullying and as she started to touch me and do what needed to be done I started to cry, not just a bit but real sobs and this was because of my 16 years experience of terrible treatment from nurses within this trust, some of which are mentioned in my previous story. She did not stop or offer any reassurance, instead she just said in a bored bossy voice why are you crying. I said because I did not like people touching me when I am not well. She responded by saying why are you saying you are unwell. To me this just shows how inadequate the care is. \n\nI was there because I had taken an accidental over dose of anti psychotic drug and a nurse who is supposed to be trained professional was unable to make the link that I might be psychotic and hallucinating, hearing voices, having any number of experiences that might make it difficult for someone I don't know to touch me. I felt like saying why are you a nurse if you have no compassion or sense. She said well we're just doing this and continued even though I was sobbing really badly. As soon as she finished I was still crying so I asked where the toilets were. She showed me and I tired to compose myself so I could wait again in the public waiting area. I could not regain composure and when I came out I thought someone might notice that I was very distressed but all that happened was that there was now a queue for the toilet so they were annoyed with me for being in there so long. I tired to wait but I also knew that if I had to wait hours and hours in the long run this would be bad for my mental health because I knew that what I really needed was sleep. \n\nI went to the nurses station and waited a respectful distance away but I was ignored until someone came back from a break. I tired to explain that waiting a long time would be bad for me and if this was going to be the case it would be better for me to leave. I was not trying to queue jump. I knew there could be any number of things going on that I did not know about. I just wanted to know if I was going to have to wait hours so I could make the decision to leave if this was going to be the case. She said she would let one of the doctors know and get back to me. More and more people were now arriving and I was finding the waiting room area really hard to be in. No one had got back to me so I went and asked again if it was possible to wait somewhere else. They said no it wasn't. In the end I made the decision to leave without seeing a doctor, partly because I knew waiting hours with no sleep would be bad for my mental health and partly because the unfeeling hostile attitude of the nurses was making me feel very afraid and reminding me of all my negative experiences, especially those in hospital last year.\n\nI had a planned appointment with my consultant soon after this and explained that I had taken an accidental overdose.\n\nAt this appointment I also tired to explain that I had psychotic symptoms probably that point for about 3 months. My Dad was with me and said he thought I did make it clear. The social worker was also present and by that time it had already been decided that I would have no input form social work and I was not well enough to put in writing my thoughts on the assessment. lots of it was just downright wrong and also in my view it was incomplete as we did not have time to discuss the practical needs I have running my home where I live alone. And partly there was no time because I spent a lot of the second appointment trying to explain that I had been psychotic and I said that I might well have told him everything was wonderful at the first appointment but that is because I was manic. None of this discussion is included in the written report of the assessment. There was also a female staff member present who I think was introduced the first time as a social work assistant. However no one introduced on the second occasion which was a few weeks later. It seemed to be assumed that I could remember who she was. However I could not as I had been unwell the first time I met her.\n\nI have now been given access to psychological input and although this is very useful and helpful I do feel angry that I have to wait 18 years for this despite accepting a referral from my consultant when I first came out of hospital when I was 20 for a service that involved a psychologist and another professional visiting the family at home. I had to wait 6 months for this as the service was facing a cut which although did not happen caused a 6 month delay and ultimately they were no help, only being patronising and I regret it as this was my first contact with that team and it ultimately led to the serious professional misconduct which resulted in a CPN resigning. I only have the opportunity for this psychologist input now because I am not being seen by the team for my area. If I was I would still only have the option of the same psychologist. I asked again for psychological input approximately 15 years ago and all I was received was 2 or 3 sessions and I felt patronised again as I had by him before and after these appointment out of which I got nothing he discharged me again. The psychologist I am seeing now who I am finding very helpful has now told me we will be working together for at least a year. Although I am glad and grateful for the opportunity now I will never get the past 18 years back and it is too late for me now to have a family which maybe could have been possible if I had had this type of input earlier.\n\nDespite everything I have written here I still have no care plan and my GP has been told when she contacted my consultant to ask how we are supposed to handle a relapse that there are many drug options and she will not commit to anything now and will see me on an emergency basis if I am unwell. This is basically a disaster. She does not understand how quickly I can become very unwell and if I become unwell again at a weekend as I did last year we will be back in the same situation. Also I would very much like to know what she thinks these many drug options are since a referral to the academic team around 2 years or so the only options were the drug I am on now or clozoapine. This makes me wonder if she is saying this without being familiar with my medication history? This has already happened with another consultant who told me confidently we could try a drug I had already tried 10 years previously but had been unable to tolerate it.\n\nThe ombudsman are now investigating my complaint regarding the events of last year.\nHowever I feel forced to post again with the events of this year as I feel the standard of the mental health services I am being offered, apart from the psychologist are so low as to be completely useless to me. However my illness is serious and I am fearful of ending up sectioned again or if they take as long to section me as they did last year I could die before they get round to it and if I am going to end up sectioned on a regular basis my quality of life will be so low that I may decide suicide is a better option. And I know it is all unnecessary as I did keep myself out of hospital for 17 years when I had the right input from dedicated professionals.\n", "I was under a surgeon for 17 years, then when something happened b4 and after my operation he discarded me like I was nothing. I had 3 hip replacements and 1 hip revision. The last time, they didn't seem to know what they were doing. I was screaming as the doctors put a tube down my neck and a needle in my spine. I was supposed to be asleep when they did it. I ended up in intensive care for 5 days at wigan hospital, as there was no resus team at the weekend. \nAfter leaving intensive care, they moved me to a gynae ward. They didn't know what to do with me. I had to show them how to lift me. Then the next day, I had to phone Wrightington and pretend I was someone else and got through to my ward so they would send an ambulance as they had declined all day. \nSince then I have had no apology. I got thrown off the list and now have PTSD and have tried to commit suicide twice. I am terrified of hospitals now, so what happens to me when my hip needs doing again? \nI hope they are proud of the suffering they have caused. A family ripped apart by my fears. 3 years and I've never slept a night through because of nightmares and am under the mental health now.

Most of her time has been as an inpatient on Ward 5 where there is no permanent Consultant. The system in place changes the Ward Consultant every Monday. This has resulted in numerous changes in treatment for my sister as one Consultant changes the decisions made by the previous Consultant. It's as if they all believe the previous decisions are wrong and they know better than their peers. This has resulted in a total lack of continuity of care, poor standards and quality of treatment. I'm convinced had the doctors not consistently changed medications etc my sister's condition would not have deteriorated to the extend it has or in the time it has.\r\nIn addition she has had no less than six moves between Shottley Bridge and Durham. On one occasion she was transferred to Shottley Bridge where, shortly after arriving the staff there needed to send her back to Durham as she has an infection that they could not treat. On another occasion she required treatment at Durham and even though there was no bed for her Shottley Bridge transferred her to Durham at 5pm. She then spent NINE HOURS in casualty before being moved to a cardiac ward at 2. 30 in the morning. Why was she transferred when there was no bed? Surely sense dictated she should have stayed at Shottley Bridge until a bed was available.\r\nI think the treatment and constant movement of my sister is absolutely shocking and more so because of her age. I'm sure this would not have happened to a younger person. I sincerely hope that no one else I know has the misfortune to require the so called services of this trust.\r\nI tried to post this information on the trusts website only to discover the required verification email did not arrive. Therefore the information is not on the trusts site - so even the opportunity to inform other people about the situation did not happen.", "I am sorry that you are feeling isolated and alone, if you would like to contact the PALS department on PALS@lpft.nhs.uk or telephone 01529 222265 we can look into your individual case for you.", "I am writing this letter to complain about the treatment that my mother received at Queen Alexandra Hospital. Living in France myself I didn't' know anything about the hospital.\nMy mother aged 75 was diagnosed in January 2014 with cancer of the ovaries, she saw a surgeon who decided with her to operate, it seems that when she did the tests for the anesthetic and heart, they found a problem. Her blood pressure was high and she had an enlarged heart.\nShe was told that she had to follow a treatment first for the heart and then they could operate.\nThey operated a few weeks after, perhaps too early as she had 2 heart failures during the operation and complications. I was contacted by my niece to come quickly as they had given her 24hours to live.\nI went as quickly as possible, when I arrived in the intensive care she was in a coma [artificial I think] it was touch and go for a few days but she finally woke up and here is where her nightmare started.\nWhen I first arrived a consultant came to see us, to explain what had happened, I was told that she might not pull through. the cancer had spread and they had had to operate on the bowl too, leaving her with a stoma (a bag which is attached to the intestines) also we were told that she was too weak to have chemo treatment. The consultant kept saying she would be kept comfortable..... What a joke! !\nI tried contacting her surgeon, to ask for more information, I needed to know different things e. g. , could she travel to France to live with me, was the cancer spreading, why they had left her with a stoma bag ..The surgeon refused to communicate with me even when my mother said it was possible to tell me!\nMy mother was sent home, and home care put in place, which it seem was very bad, my mother was rushed back into hospital by a doctor after the results of a blood test, she was completely dehydrated and malnutrition (she went from a size 22 to a size 12 in 2 months)\nI can't understand why the day nurses didn't realize this! ! My mother complained about the stoma bag which leaked everyday burning her skin raw! ! Also everything she ate was just going into the bag and her body was having no nourishments.\nSo was this stoma bag the best solution? ?\nI don't know what she weighed and I don't suppose the hospital new either, ! Because in the end for them she just became a condition and not a human! !\nBack in hospital different techniques where tried to nourish her but without success, here again I tried to contact the new doctor who she was under, and finally I can back to England to see my mum and talk to the doctor;\nWhen I arrived in the hospital and I saw what state she was in, they had done another little operation with a tube feeding her directly, she was crying with pain as nobody had come to change her stoma bag which had leaked out on her skin (it's like battery acid).\nShe was begging the nurses to come and do it .........it comes to something when you have to beg ....in the afternoon when finally someone came, I heard her screaming while they did it as it was so painful and raw.\nAlso she told me that nurses came and took her bags and creams to treat other patients.\nThis time I saw her doctor who came in on a round with some other consultants, he started to say \u201chere we have a cancer stage 4 which is spreading...........\u201d\nI will never forget the image of surprise on my mother's face; I made an excuse to go outside and asked to continue talking in another room (as patients hear when you talk just outside the door..as she had heard one saying she will never go home).\nHere I managed to ask the questions that were worrying me, but at the same time I was under shock to learn she was at a grade 4. They also discussed my mother's going home, but in the state and pain she was in I couldn't agree to this.\nUnfortunately I had to go back to France to work, my mother then caught a lung infections, which seems to be also a problem with the tubing they put in to feed her. She was taken into critical care where they drained of her lungs, we spoke every day, and she seemed to be breathing better, the day before she died she texted me asking me to do something quick as, they had put another patient in her room who had dementia this person was shouting and had chucked the commode full of wee and faeces on the bed!\nI managed to contact a friend of my mothers who went up to sort this out. My mother died the next day, I only know because when I wanted to phone her my stepfather answered the phone.\nI had not been contacted or notified by the hospital that she had died and what had finally killed her in May 2014.\n", "I am very sorry to hear how distressing your mother's care was at the hospital and I would like to send my condolences to your family.\r\nWe would really like to be able to look into this further so would appreciate if you could contact our Patient Experience Team to provide us with some more details (e-mail: PHT.PatExp@porthosp.nhs.uk)", "Over the past few years, my mother has been in and out of many hospitals due to her being blind, having heart problems and being diabetic and the care has been really good. \nShe was recently admitted to Victoria hospital in Kirkcaldy due to a suspected stroke and to be honest the care she has received has been disgusting. It was strongly emphasised to the nurses that she is blind, as well as being blind she had weakness down the left side of her body. However, she was still left alone for simple things that she struggles with, pouring herself a glass of water, cutting up her food and walking from the bed to the toilet. She was left unattended to walk to and from the toilet, and for some reason the floor was wet. When she went to make her return to her bed, she slipped and broke her hip. She was then left the entire day in her bed before she received an x-ray.\nOver the weekend, the nurses were trying to force her to use a bed pan whilst she was in far too much pain to move. She was later moved to another ward due to her hip and whilst some of the nurses have been really good, there are still some who obviously do not care as much as they should for the patients.\nOn one day we visited, she was covered in food, as the nurse who gave her lunch failed to help her bring her food close enough or eat. The nurse left my mother without even cutting up her food and so my mother was left with no choice but to eat like an animal with her hands. Another day a nurse was doing a blood pressure check and then left her without taking the cuff off her and then left my mother while she went away for her break. \nMy mother started physiotherapy and a few days later one of the nurses was trying to force my mother to move on her own from the bed to the chair, my mother struggles moving short distances by herself due to being blind but has found it even more difficult due to the stroke and having broken her hip. The nurse was adamant that my mother could do it by herself and kept trying to force my mother to do it. Thankfully, due to my mothers stubbornness on the subject, the nurse decided to offer a zimmer frame instead of the hoist. Later when confronted about it the nurse tried to deny what had been said. So not only did she not treat my mother in the incorrect manner, but she lied to us when we have our trust and faith left in her to look after my mother. \nMy father and I are very upset and disgusted about the way my mother has been treated and appalled by the fact the nurses are incapable to fill out the board of information about her properly. They failed to mention that she is blind and that she is dependant on help when it comes to her mobility. We are even more appalled that nurses often fail to look at her notes. The nurse we confronted tried to argue with us that my mother is not a stroke patient, when it had been confirmed the day before. \nIf this is what the NHS considers to be good care, then I find it disgusting because they are not showing or giving the care patients deserve. Patients should be allowed their dignity in hospital, especially when they are putting their entire trust onto strangers to look after them when they are helpless. My opinion is that this shows that some nurses are doing their job very poorly.", "Dear Kavanghpanda17\r\nI am very sorry to hear of your mother's experience, I dont think that anyone would think that this is an account of good care or the care that we aspire to deliver.\r\nI would like to have the opportunity to investigate this and if you would like to contact either my office or the Louise Ewing in patient liaison then we will arrange to investigate what happened and then to take appropriate action.\r\nDr Gordon Birnie\r\nAssociate medical Director, NHS Fife", "Dear Kavanaghpanda 17\r\nI have shared your post with the Director of Nursing for Acute Services who shares Dr Birnie's concern.

I know it is because of diminishing funds because I engage fully with relevant organisations. They maintain their stance that it is in the name of improving quality of care.\nMy CPN/Care Coordinator has met with me regularly for many years and, has effectively supported me to manage my emotional Wellbeing. This is not a tangible science and the success to managing my emotional disability relies on having support from people who have come to know me well. I have managed relatively well with this support for 3 years prior to this, when I became disorientated, I was in and out of hospital, A&E, getting picked up by police, ambulances at my door, door being broken down, etc, when all it needed was a bit of TLC, encouragement and understanding from someone who knows me until I could pick myself up and manage myself. With the right care I can lead a productive life helping others.\nSeveral months ago I learned my care coordinator was leaving.  After months of negotiating amid my deteriorating mental state and trying to articulate my needs which are well documented on previous care plans and advanced statement, a totally inappropriate 'plan' has been presented to me in spite of my objections.\nI met 3 separate times with senior Trust officers to try and find a solution that felt right for me and I came away with a mixed bag of 'answers' none of which make sense to me and certainly do not solve my problem. During this time I have become very ill due to the stress and fear. It is clear to me that the managers and front line staff are all 'singing from different hymn sheets' and appear not to understand their own systems. The only one I believed to be telling the truth was my care coordinator who had to implement the changes.  \nPersonal health budget has been mentioned but no one understands it well enough to establish if it can buy the core support that I need. It feels like a 'red herring' and I am not well enough to think about it until I feel more stable.\nIn the meantime I've experienced several dissociative episodes of self harm when I can't remember full details. This happens when I can't manage my anxiety/stress. I saw a member of the crisis team who could not help me. The home treatment team frighten me because it always involves strangers who do not understand me coming to my home and I find this intimidating.\nMy CPN has now left and I am in a seriously bad state with no plans in place that I can relate to. I have a complaint registered with the Trust but meanwhile I feel in a dangerous state of unstable emotions. I try to articulate to get resolution but to no avail. I am very afraid.\n", "I have been a patient with this service in excess of 12 years. Not one of those years has been good. My very first appointment was with a consultant who failed to show up, I sat anxiously in the waiting area for an hour. I asked the staff where the doctor was and what was happening. They did not know and they did not seem to  care. This consultant told me at the second and last appointment I had with her, that she had misplaced all my notes from 7 years of work with a psychiatrist in London. Those notes were never found.\nAnd it went downhill from there. A series of poor locums, infrequent appointments, no care team put in place, Finally there was a particular doctor. He stayed for a while. Except he cancelled some 70% of our appointments due to either illness or holidays. I felt like the other 30% was spent with him complaining of a health complaint. His lack of native level English and ability to listen to me, his patient was sadly reflected in the laughable letters sent to my GP after the few appointments he turned up at. My condition continued to deteriorate. I became more housebound, more anxious, more depressed, more suicidal.\nThen I had one doctor who was a brief ray of light. He held my hand and promised to help me manage my condition - to help me improve life. He listened, he asked the right questions, he started putting a care team in place, I was given a CPN, he was bright and so patient centred. Then he left to go to another trust. My CPN went off sick. I was left wondering where he was and when he would be back. I could get no answers from Kingswood. I had no CPN and no consultant. The CPN came back - for one appointment and then disappeared again. I have not seen him since. I made phone call after phone call to Kingswood, Where is my CPN or a new one? Who is my consultant now? No replies. I finally asked my GP to write a letter. \nShe got a response from someone at the trust who finally rang me. We will give you a new worker when she arrives in a few weeks. So this worker of some sort (I never did find out what) arrived to see me at home. I found her manner awkward - very passive-aggressive towards me. She did not ask the right questions or very many at all in fact, She made me anxious and uncomfortable. We made another appointment. She cancelled. She wrote to tell me she had set up a review with a doctor I did not know. I received the letter on a Saturday for an appointment the following Tuesday. Problem - I already had a meeting for that day. I rang Kingswood. Please let my worker know that I need to postpone this appointment - I have another on that day and the notice is just too short. I receive an accusatory voicemail message, \"You didn't show up at your appointment with the doctor\". It seems that once again - my message had not been passed on. \n\nThen the worker left another message cancelling our meeting set up in a local coffee shop. She said it was against protocol. Well in that case my CPN had been breaking with protocol for over a year I pointed out in a message back. I had enough. I had been left without any care for unacceptably long periods and  I feel like the Trust had failed me miserably. My illness was made worse by their care. I left 4 messages in the past 2 weeks for the person at the Trust that rang me previously to arrange the new worker.  In the a last attempt, I wanted to change my worker and try to get things set in place. No response, no response, no response.\nToday I get a letter from the worker. You don't try to engage with us. You did not go to the appointment. (I think  this is a load of rubbish and bile because I have kept the logs of every phone call made to Kingswood. ) We have no choice but to release you back to your GP.\nI feel like I have been abandoned yet again. It feels like inadequacies and lies are all they offer. How do I feel? Well I will not be calling the out of hours service even though I need them because my trust, hope and hard work to improve - all gone. Shattered. There are tears and hopelessness left.\n", "In my view this death was avoidable.  He had an achilles tendon injury. Full groin to toes plaster of paris back slab cast fitted. It was heavy and extremely immobilising. There was no risk assessment, no scan, no anti clot meds, no information about dvt, no instuction as to warning signs to look out for. Nothing! Forcible repositioning of his foot after over 5 weeks of being in the equinus position, he nearly passed out with the pain. An adjustable boot should have been used, to do it gradually. Doctor told me  no guidelines in place for outpatients . Not true. I have found DVT prevention policy which in my view  should have applied to my husband.

Ignoring concerns about the patients well being by those who know her best.\n2. Ignoring her needs as a patient with a visual disability - why oh why give a visually impaired patient tablets in a tiny pot she can't see?\n3. How do you know she has taken the medication which could quite easily be dropped on the floor?\n4. Leaving her covered in food because she can't see to eat so that it dries on her clothes?\n5. Having no visual indication to ward staff that she is visually impaired!\n6. Discharge information in a font that she can't read.\n7. Discharge information that was factually incorrect and a social worker who laughed when the mistakes were pointed out.\n8. Misinformation to the nursing home.\nThe lady in question is valued by so many people, friends and family and she deserves better! Some staff when I visited were exceptionally kind but they were rather the exception. Too many staff were dismissive of her needs regarding her as a dementia patient rather than someone with poor sight.\nIt's not good enough.

The concerns relate to numerous failings from admission to discharge. The continuity of care in this locality is severely lacking. We have complained via pals and received a courtesy contact with no further follow up. However the issues require further investigation if this organisation is to implement its new quality improvement plan and listen to its patients and their carers.\nMy grandfather has not been treated with dignity and has received both poor care and to my mind possible clinical negligence.\nHe was admitted for a cardiac condition and discharged to home without any investigation of social circumstances, with a chest infection - he is 90, in poor health and was carer for his wife of 64 years with dementia. Because of the poor discharge circumstances this has meant my grandmother is now in a home. My grandfather was then told by a physician at a routine out-patient appointment, which he waited over 2 hours to be seen, that he was discharged from respiratory care. He has COPD . He was spoken to in a manner that in our opinion fails equality and diversity laws and almost amounts to blatant age discrimination. He was shown no compassion about his recent experience and coming to terms with his wife now living in a home. Despite sharing this information with the physician he was asked rudely why he wasn't in a home. This was said twice.\nSince then we have had numerous needs to call out for an untreated chest infection until a couple of weeks ago. He was finally readmitted via the GP but still had to wait in A&E over 4 hours to be admitted. He is now on home oxygen and has been diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis in addition to COPD - less than a month from the outpatient appointment review. As I write this he may have been readmitted or discharged following review by the community matron who arranged for x-rays and tests querying PE. Whilst an inpatient over the Summer he was informed of his terminal condition on his own with no information other than a gold standards framework leaflet. The family were not informed despite asking staff daily.\nThe discharge meeting was arranged without the family being involved other than a phone call giving 15 minutes notice. My grandfather had not told us about his condition. I found the leaflet yesterday and we learned the horror of his latest experience. He has had no specific support regarding end of life care since being told this news because of the apparent complete lack of care from the organisation.\nWe look forward to your response from a family who have now got first hand experience of the failings of the health and social care system of this locality after providing full time care for 4 months.", "Hello,\r\nWe wanted to let you know that your story got our Healthwatch Chair thinking about what would need to change in the system for your experience to have been different.

We were told it had worked and she only had a small growth left in her groin, it had gone in the liver and other areas, which they said was good news. \nmum felt ok for a month or so, then the terrible pain started, I had to call an ambulance on at least 3 occasions, and explain to doctors, nurses, and ambulance drivers what she had been through. the put her on a trolley as a and e was so busy for at least 5 hours then onto a surgical ward.\nThe surgeon there did a scan and said it might be gall stones! ! she returned home again with strong pain relief, the gp asked our local hospice if they could see her for pain relief, which they did, but she was made to feel as if she was a hypochondriac, as the original surgeon said it was not the cancer! !\nshe was eventually taken in to the hospice in august 2013, to sort out pain relief. \nwhile there one of their doctors asked for mums oncologist to see her. I took her from the hospice in a wheel chair as by now she was very weak.\nwe waited 4 hours in that waiting room. the oncologist was running late, and mum wasn't down to see one of the juniors! ! by the end of the 4 hours, the nurses had to move us into a private waiting area as mum was rolling around and crying in pain. this was torture to see.... as her medication had worn off. the nurse fetched mums oncologist who couldn't believe how ill she had become in just 2 months. The oncologist couldn't tell me if it was the cancer as there were no scans to compare it to. I said yes, she was in a and e 3 weeks before and the doctor there did a scan, he thought she had gall stones. thankfully I remembered that doctors name, the oncologist went to check on the computer and came back quite visibly shocked.   The oncologist held mums hand and said im sorry, the tumours are now on your spine and groin and all around, all I can do for you now is radio therapy to try to get rid of the pain in your back. we took mum for the radio therapy. it did help with that pain in her back.\nshe died in October 2013. I feel we lost her twice, and my god didn't she suffer, I hope the n h s can learn from this awful story, because throughout everything she went through, my mum was always smiling, cheerful and wasn't afraid of dying, I will never get over her loss or her suffering", "We have had few visits and contacts with doctors but on a Friday about 4 pm there appears to be a rush to the wards. Doctors who have never examined or spoken to the patient feel they have the right to discuss their cases which are quite advanced illnesses and then suggest DNAR with them. This has happened on both Fridays that he has been at the hospital. \nIt would seem that doctors are sent out to get as many as possible just before the weekend as the care on the weekend is even worse than during the week and they are busy. So this being the implication why not tell everyone they are dying and why not try a DNAR? Really we have been so distressed by this as we have known the patient for 60 years as a father and he has a wife of more than 60 years. \nDo older patients have to say they want to die? Why can't clinicians make a decision if a patient is very sick and slips slowly away in the ward?\nSome patients believe still in the will of God and such hard decisions contradict their faith at this vital time. I would interested to know if others have seen this Friday Phenomenon.", "I was told I needed a large kidney stone removed, otherwise it will cause serious damage to my kidney. I had the operation only to be told casually by a nurse, not the doctor, that there was no kidney stone. They sent me home with a severe kidney infection, which required an out of hours visit to the doctor.\r\nI wrote a letter asking for a copy of my x-ray and scan only to be told on an outpatient appointment, that the system was down and I could not view the x-ray and scan. I was also told that it was not possible for me to have a copy of my scan and x-ray, but I have it on good authority that it is possible to get copies of x-rays and scans.\r\nA poor experience.", "In my opinion the hospital urgently needs to be brought up to date. There are issues with areas that have no nurse call system in place. There is poor communication between medical and nursing staff and the morale/attitude of staff is terrible. All of which, as a health care professional viewing the hospital from the perspective of a relative of a patient, worries me a lot. The A&E staff and ENT doctors who saw my partner were fantastic but at ward level there seem to be serious failings (SAU).\nEg. Patient was left without IV paracetamol for 6 hours despite paracetamol being written up for 4 hours resulting in a raging pyrexia. The nurse explained that the doctor had not asked her to give iv paracetamol but it was clearly communicated in her notes.\nPatient was admitted with throat issues and struggles to speak. There is no nurse call system in place and was left for too long without being able to contact the staff behind curtains. If there was a problem she would be unable to shout for help. Why is there no nurse call system on SAU?\nPatient is diabetic and was on sliding scale. No attempt was made to silence the pump alarms or check the problem for nearly an hour after they started. The alarm was due to the insulin being all gone so patient received no insulin for almost an hour.", "My 82 year old father was admitted to the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, in October 2013 and he was very quickly diagnosed with end-stage stomach cancer. It was suggested that he be transferred to an NHS Continuing Care facility. Ellen's Glen hospital was highly recommended to us by a friend (and NHS worker) and so we were delighted when the consultant confirmed that a bed had been found for my father there. Up until this point, we as a family, had no idea of what services a Continuing Care Facility offered, we soon found out a high proportion of patients go there to die, which would mean that Continuing Care was in fact a hospice facility. Not so (and more of this later).\nOn transfer to Ellen's Glen, my father, although suffering from early-stage vascular dementia, was conscious, able to communicate, drinking lots and eating little and his pain was being managed by oral painkillers. His mobility was poor, he was unsteady on his feet and was deemed a high risk for falls. Within a few days it became clear to me (his daughter), that his condition was worsening, he was becoming weaker and experiencing more pain. On a number of occasions I spoke to staff members to highlight my concerns and asked for his condition to be reassessed, with specific regard to pain management and the issue of him falling out of bed when trying to use the bathroom.\nFamily members visited my father at different times every day and we all soon noticed a number of issues regarding staffing levels.\nThe staffing levels were clearly too low as many of the patients had complex conditions requiring intensive nursing care. Patient's buzzers were constantly ringing, with some patients also continually calling for help. Lots of changes of staff \u2013 which is very confusing and distressing for someone suffering from dementia. Staff sickness levels seemed to be high, meaning that bank and agency staff were continually being called in to cover. \nExactly a week before my father died, my family and I visited him. We found him in a distressed state, clearly in a lot of pain, and he had tried to get out of bed to use the bathroom. We called a nurse and asked for immediate pain relief. This took some time to organise. We expressed our concerns regarding my father's pain relief and lack of pain management and the nurse confirmed that they were aware that my father was hiding his oral pain relief \u201cas he didn't want to take it\u201d. Given that my father was confused, dehydrated and suffering from dementia, we felt that the staff should have been more responsive and we requested that a syringe driver be set up for him as his pain was clearly not being managed. The nurse said that wouldn't be possible, or appropriate and would start with injecting small amounts of pain relief. We spent some time with staff that evening, outlining our concerns, emphasising that my father was too weak to use a normal cup, and that he needed help and encouragement to drink. We were given reassurances that staff would monitor my father more closely and make sure his pain relief was administered by injection.\nThe next morning my brother and I visited early. What we saw will haunt us for ever. We found my father in an even more distressed stated, half undressed, in soiled underwear, hanging off the bed, shouting for help. There were several large ceramic mugs of tea and cups of water on his side table, which he was too weak to lift to drink.\nWe demanded to see a senior member of staff. The staff member apologised and said, \u201c I am sorry that you saw your father like that\u201d. We related the events and discussions of the previous day.  The staff member was visibly shaken and upset. They returned to speak to me in my father's room, and had been crying, it was obvious. In the meantime staff come and go, cleaning the room, cleaning my father and STILL we wait for pain relief. What is taking SO long? The staff who are cleaning my father are on the verge of tears, one says \u201cI am so sorry\u201d. They look ashamed and embarrassed.\nAnother staff member returns alone to reassure us. They have been wonderful, compassionate and caring in all my dealings with them. Now they look humiliated. Another staff member who is choking back tears.\nIt becomes clear to us over this period that the home was originally resourced based on simple nursing care needs for residents but this home now has people like my father with very complex palliative care needs. The home simply cannot cope with the demands now being placed on it.\nMy father finally received a syringe driver on the Friday, only to be told that there was no Doctor on duty at the weekend \u2013 only an on-call locum doctor who could be called in emergencies.\nWe asked medical staff to ensure that the drug levels would be adequate to sedate my father and ensure he would be pain-free. However, it quickly became clear that this wasn't the case. He was experiencing break through pain every 1-2hrs. This meant that our family had to stay with my father over the whole weekend to ensure that we could get staff to respond as soon as his pain broke through. It was a very stressful weekend as my father still wasn't pain free and we muddled through as best we could. At no point did any staff member offer to contact the on-call doctor to adjust the meds in his syringe driver. This was eventually done on the Monday when the doctor was back on duty.\nOver that particular weekend, 4 patients died at Ellen's Glen. One of which I witnessed coughing, and choking and his buzzer went unanswered. We found another patient collapsed just outside their room. She had been calling for help and no one came. I had to help one until my brothers could locate a member of staff. This took some time. We were so concerned about patient safety at this point that I took the decision to contact a minister in Scottish Government.  I spoke to their office and explained that due to the \u201cdangerously low staffing levels\u201d we felt that patient care was being severely compromised and that someone needed to intervene. We were informed that we should go through the relevant NHS channels to highlight our complaint.\nI would like to make it clear that without exception, every member of staff who came into contact with my father, was polite, caring, compassionate and clearly experienced in palliative nursing care. They all expressed the wish that \u201cthey could do more\u201d. However, the staffing levels at Ellen's Glen do not allow for the appropriate end of life care to be given. There just isn't enough staff or time to tend to the complex needs of so many patients. \nWe expected a dignified and pain-free end of life experience for my father.\nIndeed, that very statement can be found in the government guideline: Living and Dying Well: \u201c our aim is to ensure the delivery of high quality palliative care to everyone in Scotland on the basis of clinical need not diagnosis, and according to established principles of equity and personal dignity\u201d.\nWe only get to say goodbye once to a loved one and sadly the last words my father spoke, in pain and distress were: \u201chelp me, please someone help me, I'm dying\u201d.\nI will never be able to erase that horrendously, traumatic memory.\nThe facts speak for themselves, patient safety, human rights and dignity are being compromised due to inappropriate staffing levels. This is not just my opinion. May I direct you to the RCN report: Guidance on Safe Nurse Staffing Levels in the UK, where it states:\n\"in the current financial context there is a real danger that health care providers will look to reduce staffing as a means of achieving short-term savings - but without consideration of the long-term costs or risk to patient care. Fiscally-led changes to care delivery need to be risk assessed for the potential impact on staffing and patient care\".\nIf anyone within the NHS, Scottish Patient Safety, Health Improvement Scotland, Royal College of Nursing or any other official body would like to speak to me further, I would welcome the opportunity to discuss our experiences to ensure that no one else is exposed to needless suffering. Thank you.\n", "Dear Coe,\n\nFirstly, I would like to thank you for sharing your story:  it must have been a difficult thing for you to do.

At times this has been when I have been very unwell and vulnerable. \nAs I work for the NHS myself, I understand the pressures and financial shortcomings better than most patients.

I felt very lethargic and down. Was given beta blockers and sent home. \nNext day, another ride in ambulance to Grantham. Again kept in, same problems. Getting worse this time, given some red liquid in a small bottle with a spray and told to take two puffs when I had chest pain again. I asked two puffs like an inhaler and the Matron said yes.

I found this to be untrue. \nI was admitted to Good Hope Hospital maternity unit one evening in May 2013, suffering from contractions. I explained that I had a previous C Section and had a feeling that my scar may have ruptured slightly, so the pain I was feeling wasn't being fully picked up by the monitor. On doing an internal examination told I was 2 cm dilated and yet was sent home on the Tuesday.\nI was later re-admitted with same problem the same evening, after speaking to my antenatal consultant and requesting an elective c section scheduled for early June (a few days before my due date). This wasn't even taken into consideration by staff on ward! \nI told the staff I felt like I needed to empty my bowels, which after pregnancy laxatives I was able to do and yet still had feeling I needed to go requested internal and it never happened was sent home yet again. \nIn the very early hours of that Friday I was driven in absolute agony by my mother back to GHH, where it was discovered during an emergency c section that my daughter had not only caused my previous scar to rupture, but she also caused a uterine rupture (my bladder burst) which was almost missed!\nAfter coming around I was told that they thought I had a blood clot in left leg and while waiting to go for a scan, was told quite coldly by a consultant that I really should have been sterilized as another pregnancy could kill me!

I was referred to the CMHT, which filled me with hope of finally having multiple mental health problems treated, as I had reached the end of my rope and was actively suicidal.\nThe CMHT was a mess from the start. Ignoring the first referral until nudged by the GP (their excuse being that they had relocated to an office on the other side of the borough, highly obstructive to patients from north Lewisham seeing them), and eventually having me initially seen by a nurse who was grossly dismissive of problems (\"that doesn't sound like an eating disorder\", a sloppy conclusion reached when he decided to butt in partway through my explanation of what was happening to me) and told me I would not be seen by the CMHT but instead referred to Mind.\nOver a month later, I had heard from no one. The GP did not understand what had happened. My workplace occupational health eventually nudged the CMHT as my situation had worsened during their silence, causing me to lose a month of work and take a hit to my income. The CMHT had changed their mind and wanted to see me again, fulfilling my earlier request to be assessed by a psychiatrist.\nThe psychiatrist was fine - personable and reassuring, and largely understanding. He recognised that as I had been actively suicidal between visits that I was at high risk and needed to be placed on medication. I was told I could pick up a prescription from my GP that day. For a week, I visited and called the GP, whose receptionists and doctors were confused and had no record of this prescription being sent through. My condition worsened. I was suicidal, let down, and now sure that the very act of seeking help was a negative trigger that had to be avoided.\nWhen I complained to PALS and asked them to cancel a later CMHT appointment (I saw no use as this appointment was intended to discuss my experience with the medication I never received), I was discharged from the CMHT and left stranded. The explanation was nightmarish: the prescription for a suicidal patient had simply sat in their office for a fortnight before being sent.\nI received an apology, but frankly the damage has been done and that the apology came with a discharge letter was a slap in the face at my lowest point. Two months later, I am depressed, anxious, and no longer want to be alive. Disordered eating and poor self esteem is destroying my social life and all of the above is conspiring to ruin my career. The toll it is taking on my body is stressful and upsetting, and to compound matters I have been the victim of violent crime and despite suffering nightmares, fear and anxiety following the incident, cannot seek help because I am equally as afraid of the mental healthcare this borough provides.\nI believe treatment is vital for anyone suffering with mental health issues, and I would always urge others to seek help and seek it forcefully, remaining unforgiving of failure and demanding an adequate and timely response to their problem. My mistake was in being too forgiving and too passive (though when passivity is a hallmark of depression it seems odd for professionals to take advantage of this as an excuse to be lax), and I believe that this mistake will ultimately be fatal. I may never trust another health worker again.", "We are sorry that your grandfather's experience at our hospital wasn't what you would expect and are very keen to investigate.

It gets more and more heartbreaking.\nIn my opinion basic care on the ward is not there. It's just simple things like their bed has not been made for days so they are sleeping on a bare mattress. There's no encouragement to get up and showered. They are able to stay in bed all day and night, sleeping with the same clothes on for 2 weeks.\nWhen I have rung or gone into visit and complained, still nothing changes. There are no activities that would inspire you to get up: no OT, no fitness facilities, no talking therapies, no library to stimulate your mind. I have asked about this but they said the ward is closing so all these facilities are not available.\nMy relative has been in there since April. It is just so unfair. I feel they are not getting the best treatment. Just sorting medication is not enough. Patient's overall welfare needs to be cared for as well.\nI've been in touch with PALs and I've been asking continuously about an injected form of medicine. Once they are out in the community, they'll stop taking their oral medicine as has happened on every previous occasion. They need insight and support around this.

I would apologise for not answering here but I had hoped we could address the issues at the meeting.\r\nIn specific answer to your questions, the visits I mentioned are unannounced. There are two tiers of inspection one from an NHS Lothian Team completely independent from the Community Health Partnership and these happen approximately every 18 months. Then an internal team which has external people I.e. infection control, estates and domestics on it including a patient representative not from the actual inpatient area enables us to audit all areas on a yearly basis.\r\nThe audits are twofold on something we call a PQI or Patient Quality Indicators audit which mirrors the Health Environment Inspectorate inspections and Older People in Acute Care which is an audit developed nationally about the experience factors. We have also implemented this as, whilst Ellen's Glen is not an acute hospital, the experience factors are just as important in a more downstream facility.\r\nAll of these audits are unannounced. There would be no point in doing them announced as we would then not learn about improvements required. Each area then has an action plan developed around the areas of improvement and we then work to implement them.\r\nEllen's Glen is subject to National Health Environment Inspections and was added to the inspection regime when community hospitals were added.\r\nDocumentation on these visits is available and I would be happy to share it with you at the meeting.\r\nSecondly the \u00a3181,000 is being focussed on the three frail elderly wards to firstly help reduce variation I.e. improve skill mix of staff. However we do know this is not the full answer to challenges we have. NHS Lothian is introducing e rostering and safe care which will commence being rolled out from April 2015 and this will enable us to measure patient acuity and set staffing levels more scientifically than is currently the case. We run the national workforce planning tools yearly (this is mandatory from the Government). Mental health wards were done in August and the Frail Elderly wards commenced on the 6th October.\r\nFinally, as you will be aware a meeting has been set up with the Chief Nurse for Edinburgh CHP, the Clinical Nurse Manager for IPCC and a Chief Nurse from the Acute Division to meet with you and your brothers on the 14th November.\r\nI trust and hope that meeting will go a long way to answering your questions in more detail.\r\nYours sincerely,\r\nStuart Wilson", "I live in Bournemouth. 2 years ago I went for a routine smear test the nurse inserted the speculum and opened it till I screamed in agony.  she then continued to open it more whilst I was still screaming she left me on the couch going to her work station I do not know how long she was gone but I continued to scream I was paralysed and terrified I did not know how long this torture would continue. when she finally returned and removed the speculum I was so traumatised I could not speak. on leaving the surgery all the reception staff had grins on their faces. finally after more than 2 months I contacted the practice manager who ignored my suffering I contacted p. a. ls and n. h. s England finally the police who informed me that they know this sort of thing happens but as I had agreed to have a smear test they was nothing they could do.  When I first discussed this with my gp she offered to send me for counseling on the 3rd time I saw my gp I was finding it difficult to come to terms with what the nurse had done to me and was then told by my gp there was a 6-9 months wait to see a counsellor. all these investigations took up to 18 months\nI finally went to the ombudsman they told me they would investigate my complaint\nwhat did they do they asked my practice manager who is hired and payed by the surgery to interview the nurse who said she could not remember my showing any discomfort during my smear and as she had written nothing on my medical records\nthey believed her, the practice manager was admonished for failing to keep any records regarding my complaint and what other records had he failed to record\nthat has left me so very angry severely traumatised unable to have any intimate relations and certainly never ever and more smears\nI have done all I can but justice is not being done", "I have been accessing Merseycare since December 2013 & they have not listened to my needs.

During this time, I felt that she has been misdiagnosed, mistreated, ignored and been largely left to flounder. \nIn the last 4 weeks alone she has been sectioned, arrested, respite care and hospitalised, and still nothing. She has stopped her antidepressant as her psychiatrist failed to produce the reducing prescription. Her psychologist went on holiday and then on return got the date wrong, so 3 weeks and no support.\nCurrently she has not slept for nearly one week, has not eaten for nearly 5 days and still nothing is being done. \nA senior staff member from CMHT North Tyneside came to my wife's discharge from the section, which served only to provoke her. This was witnessed by an employee from the hospital, who was in disbelief at what they saw. \nMy children have had to move out as the situation is so bad, and still nothing. The support for my wife has been almost non-existent and support for her family and carer (me) is worse than non-existent. In all honesty, I feel that you are better off talking to a vet than these people. We have found their care incompetent and negligent, at best.", "Before I tell you this story let me inform you until two years ago my care from my gp and doctors were excellent. With deep regret I have to say the two severe traumatic experiences that have devastated my life and a minor incident by comparison has negated the goodwill I have felt.\nAt 61 years I have suffered scoliosis all my life but with good posture and the right exercise I have lived my life to the full. However in the last few years I have suffered abdominal and lower back pain. After ruling out any abdominal problems I was referred to a consultant rheumatologist at Christchurch outpatients in Bournemouth.\nAs soon as I had met this consultant I had a bad feeling. They asked me to lay on the couch raise both my legs straight about 2-3 feet up, then slowly lower my legs keeping them straight. I was totally unassisted, I felt my back arching and burning and screamed \"my back my back\" the consultant seemingly shouted at me in what I found to be a very aggressive way to hold my position. I then again screamed \"my back my back.\" My back then went into spasm I was shaking and thought I was having some sort of fit.\nThis is called a double leg lift which I have recently found out it is not recommended for even the young and fit and very dangerous for people with scoliosis and lower back problems. The consultant was 4 feet to my right shoulder and the nurse was behind me. At no time did the consultant come to my aid to check for any damage.\nI just wanted to get out of that surgery as I was in shock. I complained to my GP about this incident and cancelled all appointments with this rheumatologist.\nHowever I needed to be referred to another specialist because, not only did I have the original problem, I was also suffering from the additional pain caused by this person.\nI went one more time just to close my treatment with this rheumatologist.\nWhen I arrived they looked embarrassed and red faced, demanding to know why I had cancelled all my appointments. I replied there were many reasons why I had cancelled. I then told them my problems had resolved just to get them off my back. However just before leaving I asked them if they realised they'd damaged my back the last time I was there which they seemed to acknowledge. \nI wrote to PALs but was expecting the usual excuses and got them. I contacted the GMC. They looked into my complaint, then replied according to our consultant the double leg lift was an appropriate exercise. I could not believe this so asked under FOI what qualifications had this consultant to make such a decision on the use of the double leg lift.\nIn my particular case, two weeks later I received a reply on why they should not release this info but I could appeal which I have. I was also informed if this appeal failed I could appeal again. This is pen pushing at its' worst.", "After 5 misdiagnoses from my mother's GP surgery, my mother finally collapsed at home and was taken to hospital. On the second day at hospital she was diagnosed with terminal cancer. At the time we were told that an oncologist or consultant would see us as a family. This never happened. Two days in and my mother was taken to the geriatric ward, Wheal Agar. \nWheal Agar is a dark, hot ward in the bowels of the building, lacking in natural light. As we entered we heard the cries of dying people, the singing of the nurses and the smell of human excrement. This sensory experience did not change for the four days my mother was alive here. My sister said it reminded her of a third world hospital ward. \nSometimes it took ages to enter as when you pressed the buzzer, staff didn't come. I noticed other visitors helping each other out instead. We witnessed a shocking lack of dignity for my mother and other patients. We saw different nurses every day. Some didn't know how to move the bed, or change the drip, which resulted in mother's blood shooting out onto the grimy floor. Food was left on my mother's face after a small meal. She developed ulcers on her tongue and mouth but nobody seemed to notice. I don't believe my mother was washed until the morning of her death. I cleaned her limbs and face regularly. \nThe young doctor in charge of the ward flared red in the neck and started to cry when we asked why nothing was being done to relieve mother's pain and suffering. This astonished me and made me think that this doctor must have been very inexperienced. Thereafter, mother received some pain relief, but it seemed that an action plan of palliative care had not even been thought about. On one occasion, mother was moved into a different room without our knowledge. We found out on arrival. Clearly her level of distress was upsetting the other patients. \nA senior nurse was sent in by the young doctor in charge to discuss our request of taking mother home to die, which then descended into what we found to be an unprofessional argument. This was the first time we had even seen this senior nurse, despite the fact that we visited every day. At no point during the whole experience did a doctor, consultant or nurse find us to speak to us about mother. We had to seek them out for information or to inform them of mother's or even other patient's distress. We did not get the opportunity to remove mother from this ghastly place, she died here on the sixth morning at hospital. The senior nurse was seemingly triumphant in telling me and almost tried to physically stop me from seeing my own mother, but I already knew and I went in. \nI am horrified that my mother went through this. I was expecting a programme of medical care but this was entirely absent. I have discussed what happened with my GP who has recommended I complain formally, but it is clear that the current system is in favour of the medical profession not the patient or family aggrieved. \nThis ward was closed in 2012 but clearly reopened again and is running the same as usual. Even though I am Cornish and have an occupation here, this heartbreaking and grotesque experience had led me to think about leaving the county completely.", "Dear Southbank\r\nI received your posting today following your experiences in the Rheumatology department.

He slipped down a muddy bank and severed his little finger and partially severed 2 fingers next to that. He was therefore bleeding quite heavily. He called 999 to request an ambulance to take him to A & E and was told they could not send an ambulance as it was 'a minor injury'. His boss drove, using flashing lights, to let other drivers know the urgency and breaking the speed limit to get to Royal Surrey County Hospital. Upon admittance he was told the full extent of his injuries and was rushed (in a ambulance) to the Queen Vicoria Hopsital in East Grinstead for emergency 12 hour micro surgery to save his fingers. I would, like to know on what grounds the ambulance service at Royal Surrey County Hospital deemed this to be 'a minor injury' and why they didn't do their job properly?", "Dear homer tested\r\nI am so sorry to hear of your son's accident and the subsequent surgery he had to endure to re-attach his fingers - it must have been an awful shock for all of you, not to mention painful for your son.\r\nWhile we are not able to send an ambulance to every 999 caller, we would very much appreciate the opportunity to investigate the concerns you raise about your specific case.

Therefore keeping my moods and so illnesses in check.\nHowever last year after yet another failed treatment I was informed that I was being discharged without any warning or preparation. I would now have to mainly look after myself with support from my doctor.

As a female I knew it would be hard to get the GP to refer me for diagnosis ( see: https: //www. youtube. com/watch? v=ZBOTkvM1mJw ), but I made an appt in february and went prepared with EQ test results etc. The GP was very understanding and referred me to the IAPS team in sunderland.\nIAPS did an initial assessment and agreed I should be referred to the autism diagnosis centre in morpeth, where the waiting list was a year. At the end, the nurse who conducted the IAPS interview decided she could refer me via a letter to my GP, or I could refer myself. I asked the difference and she said-if you refer yourself you can put in all of your information. If you dont, your GP will forward my email and they wont get any of this information ahead of your assessment. I had 3 files full of information to condense into the letter but at that moment it sounded like the better option for me to do it (again, it is a typical autistic trait to make a silly decision 'in the moment). I never should have agreed as inability to do these things is one of my main difficulties- a big part of why I am being referred.\n9 months of panic later I finally managed to make an appt to see another GP at my practice as I wasnt coping with day-to-day life at all. I went unprepared this time, as I had been told there would be a letter from the IAPS team telling my GP where I had been referred and assumed this would be simple (Me: \"Please could you push it through as I havent been able to\". Doc: \"Yes of course\"). How wrong I was!\nAs soon as I said the referral was for Aspergers, the GP rolled his eyes and said-No, we don't do that. I explained the referral situation, and the fact I can't use the phone because I think I have have auditory processing problems which is why it has gone on so long.\nHe became very irate, literally throwing his arms around and leaning over the desk quite aggressively-Of course you can use the phone, you're talking to me fine!  I explained this problem with phones was very common among autistic people.\nHe implied only boys could have aspergers, which I informed him was incorrect. He then asked me about my job history, which fits with the experience of many with the disorder- top of my class with many awards but unable to gain/stay in employment because of interview techniques and social problems.\nHe also told me the fact I focus on researching autism was the problem (intensely focusing on a special interest is a symptom/coping mechanism of aspergers). He ignored or dismissed all of the other information I gave (I am extremely knowledgeable on the subject so could defend myself well against his dismissive comments).\nHe chastised me for using medical terms like \"auditory processing\" (again, part of aspergers is the inability to use certain, often more appropriate, language, so I found it very difficult to explain without these terms! I explained this but this obviously annoyed him more.\nBy this time I was crying hysterically (I was so shocked) and felt very intimidated but he argued with me for a full 20-25 mins.\nHe said I should just get someone to do things for me. I told him my partner could not help me as he had been diagnosed with Dyspraxia as a child and had similar problems, and had a full-time job to keep. He dismissed this saying that diagnoses like this were not worth listening to.\nI explained I was now allergic to so many things (immune problems and food sensitivities are yet another indicator of autism) that I could hardly eat anything and was finding it very difficult. He replied with-Have you lost a lot of weight? NO!  (He didn't weigh me and I am very slim anyway- I don't have any to lose). When I said I managed to survive by binge eating certain foods and over-indulging when I do eat, and he said -Don't we all? ! .\nHe said he should do some research on this subject as he did not know anything about autism (so why was he still trying to argue with me? ). When I suggested a source, he said -I'm not going to look. If I focus on it I'll just start thinking I have it too!  (I think this was supposed to be a sick joke about people \"googling\" symptoms and hypochondria)\nHaving given up, I asked if I could at least be referred for my bowel problems. It had taken a lot of effort for me to make this appointment. He refused, because apparently I had never had any bowel problems (I have throughout my life, and I have been referred for them previously from that practice). Because of his manner, the only information I felt comfortable giving him was that I often had blood when I went to the toilet. He dismissed this too.\nHe then started complaining that he had patients waiting, guided me to the door, still crying, and finished with-Make an appointment for 3 weeks time. By then you might have a job. I'm guessing from the fact I currently have no job, he thought I was trying to get benefits from an autism diagnosis? I am a carer and have just received inheritance which means I do not need benefits, nor would I even be eligible. I have claimed jobseekers allowance for only 3 desperate months in my entire life (I am 29).\nI have been trying to get help with paying bills for 3 months now but no advocacy services etc will make allowances for the fact I can't use the phone. I have been in touch with at least 5 of these services but NOT ONE has sent me a letter. Some continually phoned me despite me telling them I could not answer the phone, which caused me anxiety. I find this situation absolutely ridiculous because I do not even consider myself particularly vulnerable (I have a good vocabulary etc) yet I can't even get help. What is happening to deaf/non-verbal/Learning disabled people in my situation?\nI have been a complete mess since this GP appointment, unable to feed, wash, clothe myself or sleep properly. I was NOT suffering with depression before this appointment, but this experience has definitely sent me towards it. Thankfully, an autism support worker since referred me to the diagnosis centre in Morpeth, but there is still no sign of help from any advocacy services so my stress continues.\nNICE guidelines and the autism act 2009 state that there should be a clear pathway to adult autism diagnosis, but all I have experienced is a system which actually puts barriers in the way of people with autistic-like problems. It is disgusting the way I have been treated by many health professionals in the past and I am sad to see this is getting worse, not better.", "Thank you for your further comments.

On visiting my Mother on the late in December I was told she was now medically and surgically discharged. I spoke to Mother's consultant as there was a particular place within the Health Service I would like her to be taken to but was told this could not be done, I was given the reasons for this decision which I accepted.\nOn returning home that afternoon I began contacting Care Homes in our area because my Mother needed 24 hour care during a period of respite, I had discussed this with the Nurses on the ward and they agreed that this was a necessity.\nMid-morning of the next day in  December I received a telephone call from a lady on the ward. Her attitude was very blunt saying that my Mother had been discharged and \u201chad to go\u201d and was \u201cgoing\u201d. I tried to explain to this lady that I had been in contact with every home in our area and only two had vacancies and both of these were making arrangements to visit the ward and carry out their obligatory assessments. She would not listen to me, she continually talked over the top of me, and she was blunt to the point of rudeness or arrogance. She ended the conversation and put the \u2018phone down. I was given no information concerning my Mother's movements. Later that day I received a \u2018phone call from a Care Home telling me my Mother had been \u201cdelivered\u201d to them around tea team and asking me what all this was about.\nI'm sure you'll well understand that my tiny, frail, blind and deaf Mother was very distressed at being \u201cbundled out\u201d out in this manner and I've found out since that she told the ward staff she didn't want to go. I've also found out since that there were actually empty beds on the ward at that time so I cannot understand the apparent dramatic urgency of my Mother's removal.\nI was not in any way using the Hospital as a Hotel, indeed I had spoken to Nurses there telling them that if there was any extra care my Mother needed, she could not feed herself at that time for example, I was more than happy to pay for it. I am very unhappy about the way my Mother was moved but more than that I am extremely unhappy about the tone and attitude of the lady I've referred to above there was absolutely no need for her to have conducted herself in that manner.", "Serious failures in the community primary health care and respite or residential services in Amblecote. In my opinion it's tantamount to carer abuse. Despite pleading for fair and reasonable help and rest over a 30 months period, nothing has been forthcoming and as a result the carer has broken down with overload (perpetual 24x7 full time care) and the patient's condition is seriously deteriorating with very considerable pain and suffering.

District nurses now attend to assist him once every other day with toilet duties which initially was a huge help for my mum. However, recently the level of care has really deteriorated to the point with the district nurse managers are refusing to all the nurses to assist him the way he has always been used to and finds easy to cope with and expecting my mum to start doing this aspect of work again. I'm furious!\nMy mum is elderly with arthritis and simply can not do all the lugging about anymore. This appaulling level of cover undermines my brother's dignity and recently both my brother and mum have been talking about suicide as they simply are finding the stress of the situation too much to cope with and feel trapped, undignified and totally uncared for.\nI am scared stiff of one or both of them possibly taking such drastic action and I am disgusted that an occupation of care and trust has left two very vulnerable members of my family feeling completely uncared for and unable to trust the very people who are there to help. Why do people go into nursing if they don't care! I have now had to involve social services and inform the local mental health team in the hope that just someone will offer some dignity and respect to my brother who through no fault of his own, has had to endure a very personal intrusion with toilet issues for the best part of his life and now at a time when his mum can no longer assist is made to feel even more humiliated and consumed by the stress this has created.", "I would like to thank all the nice staff at Adferiad - they all know who they are.

Whilst much delay can be explained by her condition I have complained before (Mid June) with absolutely no response having been received to date. Perhaps I should have waited longer? I am sure that the CQC would have something to say on this and your monthly Board Meetings patient sections are in my opinion a complete waste of time to what you're actually doing.\nMy wife had a 5 hour GI operation recently. Mr Ramalingam and his team of surgical staff could not have been better, he phoned me with details of the operation and his Registrar came to the ward bedside and summarised what was to happen. We thank them all for their activities and feedback.\nHowever, the nursing care since she went to a ward (Kings A2) has been in my view appalling. The notes file at the bed indicated another bed number when I visited. My wife indicated people were looking at the wrong records. What is wrong here?\nThings culminated with her ringing me (very upset) to say that (a) following a colorectal procedure the nurse was demanding to inject Clexane into her abdomen (had she any idea of the procedure the patient had had? ) when it could have been injected into her thigh (b) that she could not get pain relief in the form of Tramadol rather than paracetamol which had proved ineffective at controlling the pain (She got 1000mg when I was there). When I was there I witnessed a nurse who thought she was on PAC rather than on a metered.\nAfter a phone call from my wife I rang and demanded that the Clexane was injected to the thigh and that Tramadol should be given (It had been written up by Dr) and was told that the nurse was a temporary and did not know that Clexane could be given in the thigh (Is this incompetence or not? ) and the Tramodol had to be written up as a CD drug (as an MHRA responsible person I know it is a CD(3) preparation) and this was just delaying things. In my opinion a completely unnecessary delay on the hospital's part. If a Dr orders things and signs dose, frequency, etc. then surely the patient gets them? Or is it the nurses / pharmacists rule OK?\nShe got the drugs sometime around 2330 but why did we have this exchange? Would she have got them if I had not rung? I suspect NO is the answer.\nAnyway Tramadol is a CD(3) drug and all the paperwork does not apply in a hospital.\nCan you possibly assure me that things will improve after this catastrophic start within 6 hours of arriving from the theatre?\nThis feels like an appalling situation when you are under review.\nI really dread the fact that my wife has to endure 5-7 days as an inpatient with your Trust.", "Thank you so much for taking the trouble to feedback your experiences to us yesterday.

He also started showing symptoms of IBS at around nine or ten months old after an upset tummy.\n\nHe was taken by his parents to his GP. He was given various potions for his skin, and some tummy treatments. neither worked.\n\nMy grandson was referred to Addenbrooks Hospital in Cambridge for his bowel problems, which is over 30 miles away from where they live. This meant an hour's journey, park and ride, taking time off work.\n\nThey treated the symptoms as for constipation, prescribing several doses of Movicol over a long period of time to which he had an extreme allergic reaction and his ezcema became even worse.\n\nIt took 4 months for his skin to heal, after, in desperation we went privately to a dermatologist - who was horrified and prescribed low dose steroids, which cleared up the skin and improved the bowel.\n\nWe are now facing real problems.\n\nAs Addenbrooks were not able to deal effectively with my grandson, insisting he was just constipated, the private doctor suggested we see - a Pediatric Gastroenterologist at Great Ormond Street Hospital. The doctor was not convinced that his skin and bowel problems weren't related, and  felt Addenbrooks should have recognised that, instead of just treating him for constipation. \n\nWe went to Great Ormond street Hospital in September. The doctor was horrified by my grandson's condition, and set out a suitable course of action, but stated that it was the responsibility of Addenbrooks Hospital, the doctor felt this should have been identified by them and treated by them.\n\nAs a result of our visit to Greatt Ormond Street to see the doctor, we were given to understand that the doctor would contact Addenbrooks and try to set the record straight which would facilitate an appointment to rectify their previously inadequate service. As the treatment advised by the doctor included colonoscopy and various other invasive exploration,the doctor suggested that they would approach Addenbrooks and explain things. The doctor believed that as Addenbrooks had messed up, they should accept to treat him.\n\nWe are not insured so cannot afford this, particularly as we were told the NHS have failed us.\n\nResult.... Nothing.\n\nThe doctor appears to have been unable to persuade Addenbrooks that they have failed to treat my grandson properly, and in any case as we went privately, they are refusing to acknowledge that my grandson can now be treated on the NHS. \n\nWe only went privately on the advice of another doctor, because Addenbrooks were so completely ineffective.\n\nMy grandson is still tearing his skin off, despite all the so-called accepted treatments and oils and ointments, which do not work. \n\nThe prednisolone the doctor prescribed cleared up the skin, and assisted the bowel problems, but another doctor felt that the steroids, despite being a low dose, would mask any bowel problems and make diagnosis difficult.\n\nMy grandson is still having to wear nappies because his bowel problems are extreme and ebb and flow like a roller-coaster.\n\nHis parents are at their wits end, as their GP will not assist as there was a private consultation (because we got no where with the NHS).\n\nWe have a five year old who is now suffering terribly, and a medical profession that seems to be completely unable to get it together. This has gone on for years, so we would appreciate all the help, advice and assistance that you can give.\n\nThe treatment and advice we have received from two doctors has been excellent, but we feel that as we were forced to go privately, we have now successfully managed to make our poor grandson ineligible for the NHS treatment he should have got in the first place.\n\nThere seems to be no effective means of communication between the private sector and the NHS.\n\nThe result is a little boy who, although not suffering from a life threatening ailment, is extremely distressed for most of the time.

I couldn't visit a couple of days later and when I saw my husband, I could barely believe my eyes. He was lying in a bed in front of the nurses' station that all and sundry were trekking past, dressed in a dirty hospital gown (he had clothes with him) with his bare backside hanging out for the world to see. \nHe was covered in bruises and complained of being thirsty and in pain. He had no drip or drink that I could see. The next day he again indicated he was thirsty, the best I managed to get out of the staff is 'he's got no signs of dehydration today'. I had asked the staff time and again if he had had a chest x-ray, having had broken ribs before. No one answered that question, though the on-duty doctor snapped at me and told me he didn't have a chest infection, which is a rather curious answer to a question about broken bones. \nWhen I called later in the day to see how he was doing, I was told he needs an MRI scan. I was under the impression that since a diagnosis had been given to me days before, he had already had one. The person I spoke with could not tell me about a diagnosis. The following day I was told he needs 'another scan' but wasn't told what scan or what for. A couple of days later he was being treated for a chest infection and though there by now was NBM written on his board, there were no IV fluids, nor ng tube. \nSince when this NBM had been on his board have no idea, as no member of staff thought it necessary to tell me. When I asked, the reply was didn't anyone tell me? He again was very thirsty and there was no oral care anywhere near him. It took staff 45 minutes to provide some and when I requested a spare set, I was told it is not possible to provide this as they had run out. When I called in later on, I was told by the person who was 'caring' for him that she had told my husband that he may never get any better because she didn't want to give him false hopes. A week after a stroke? \nNeedless to say by this time I was seriously concerned about my husband's welfare as he had lost a lot of weight and his condition was getting worse by the day. So I called the hospital early to see if he at last would be transferred to Kettering General. I was told in no uncertain terms that patients never get transferred at weekends. I told the person I spoke with that I would be visiting that afternoon with a medically trained friend and would have a word with an advocate as well. Amazingly a bed was found for my husband within a couple of hours and I was told that there is no need for me to visit.\nMy husband was transferred to Kettering General Hospital without his MRI scan, which a member of staff in Kettering told me Northampton well knew was needed. As I was there anyway, I offered to call the hospital to request it. Which I did, to be told by whoever answered the phone that should the consultants in Kettering require them, they will contact the consultants at Northampton to request them and that as I already have such a lot on my plate, I should not concern myself with these issues which in any case are none of my business. I told the lady that I was in fact calling from the hospital and would she like to speak with a member of staff who said she would need those scans. By the time the sister got to the phone, the person in Northampton had hung up. My husband was immediately put on a drip as he was dehydrated and was later on treated for re-feeding syndrome.\nAll this was deeply upsetting so I asked our MP for advice and he put in a complaint to NGH on my behalf. They were unable to complete their enquiries in the time they had allotted themselves, and naturally I didn't mind giving them the extension they requested. I finally received a response from them in mid January. The response to the first question was 14 lines of waffle. \nThe hospital took great care to assure me my complaint had been taken seriously. Is this for real? Every time I spoke to a member of staff at this hospital, I received a different reply and obfuscation seems to be the most appropriate word for this waste of paper of a response that I received, though fortunately senior staff has been made aware of my complaint. I was rather disappointed with this reply, so, as per instructions, I replied to the complaints department. I asked them to thank the hospital and explained that my understanding of how the answer would be more of an hour by hour report which would include his medical notes to which I was not allowed access to at the time despite having requested to see them, as well as his care plan etc, which I also didn't see and was denied access to. \nThe complaints department replied to me to say they will investigate, this will take 25 days and my husband's hospital records are not their department. The Access Office has sent me a four page application form which requires independent witnesses and demands a charge for the records which may be \u00a350 and does not include a \u00a310 administration fee. Whatever the fee turns out to be, it is to be paid upon request prior to the release of any documents. I have lost count how many consent forms I have provided them with so far. \nIt is stressful enough to have one's healthy husband turn into a disabled one in matter of minutes without having to fear for his safety in a hospital and then receive replies like this when you want to know what happened. This reply really beggars belief and I'm sorry I bothered to ask. I'm very disappointed and what really concerns me is how many stories like this -and much worse- I've heard since October.\nMy husband is still in hospital, as he has been since Boxing Day, in a ward totally unsuited to his needs, without the therapies he should have been receiving, still waiting for a bed, though thankfully it now looks like the transfer closer to home for some well-deserved and long-waited for rehab might actually take place. You didn't expect there to be a date, did you: )", "I started therapy over two yrs ago at the Crawley centre.  I think it is a money making scheme with only staffs interests.   when I started there I believed the staff would help me but behind your back its different. people often turned up smelling of alcohol only for others to take the blame.  I feel like they mess with your meds.  I needed to change mine due to side affects I asked to see a doctor you would think this was easy ....no.   so after asking and asking for someone to speak to concerning my meds i took it upon myself to withdraw.   this was awful when they finally see me I was a mess but they wouldn't give me medication and stressed I was now prone to seizures.  I left the unit distraught ....no one contacted me for two weeks! !   in that time I went to my own gp and my meds were sorted out and I was listened to.  for all the Crawley knew I could of been dead.  It seems that their attitude is don't come in dont get help but they still claim for you being there.  what goes on is bad.

The first two assessments were really positive, I was as honest as I could possibly be, and the therapist/nurse was really understanding. Unfortunately, on the third occasion, I was unfortunate enough to meet with another therapist that was a different experience. The first thing they explained to me was that this was yet another assessment, except they didn't want to read my notes and form an opinion based on what another therapist had said (which is EXACTLY what they did, and they even confirmed that by writing it in the copy of the patient letter I received).\nThey declined to accept me into the service, giving reasons which to me sounded absolutely ridiculous - and still do. Essentially I felt they used lies, deception and a mistreatment of my dignity and trust in order to form an opinion which was no different to their colleague. They explained how they were friends with another therapist I saw, and has basically regurgitated the same nonsense as before.\nIn the end I had never been as offended, and neither had my mother who had been invited into the room. In the end it was my mother, not I, who stood up and expressed her disbelief at how ignorant, rude and poor at her job they were.\nHow dare they decide that I am suddenly not going to be accepted into the service after three assessments all of which were positive, and they even said themself that I would be \"a very good candidate for therapy\". Essentially they lied to me, and declined because I have self medicated in the past. Well, I hate to point out the obvious; but for asl ong as somebody is struggling to access the help and support they need- they will do anything and everything they can to avoid depression and panic attacks. Now, for them to suggest that I am some kind of drug addict is absolutely sensational; and I couldn't believe what I was hearing. In five years of begging for support my health has gone downhill only because it is so difficult to access.\nWhat annoyed me the most, is that I had explained to them that in accordance with my doctors agreement, I had stopped the self medicating just to show that I am worse without it. Ultimately, they have doomed me to a cycle of self medicating again; and for that resent this therapist. I have never been so offended, let down and disappointed in my life. how can you deny somebody the help they so desperately need and you say they would be a good candidate for? ! ? I won't swear, but I'm sure you know what I'm thinking. Frustrated is not the word to describe the experience. I won't ever try to access therapy again. They are all really judgemental and do not care. I also failed to appreciate how they thought it was within their rights to decide my end route of care, with absolutely no involvement from myself.\nFurthermore, im currently reading over the letter they have sent back to my GP, and I have already highlighted what in my view are 3 or 4 lies and twisted truths which on paper probably do back up their claims (apparently I spend a large sum of money a day self medicating), but I would love to know where they think I get that kind of money from.\nIt frustrates me how psychologists in my view are so single minded and narrow in their approach and have a really bad case of tunnel vision. To hone in on my self medicating is the complete opposite of what they should have done, especially after saying they wanted to hear from me - and not what the previous therapist wrote. If the support I was receiving was adequate, and I was generally well in myself, and the medications and tablets my doctors gave me worked -- I would not be self medicating.\nFor as long as my experience of \"support\" is judgemental and feels horrible then I am sorry but it doesn't take a degree to work out what pattern is going to continue.\nThanks for nothing, and I hope you can learn to stigmatise your patients less in future.", "Thank you for taking the time to provide us with this useful feedback.

We then had some problems getting her latched on to feed properly. I had a lovely midwife who was very helpful, then the shift changed, my daughter wouldn't latch at all and the next midwife decided she would need a formula feeding without even watching us attempt to feed. Being an exhausted first time mum I did as she said. The night midwife came back on and got us back on track although latching was still very hard.\nFrom this point things only got worse. I went home and the pain began. I asked my midwife, then my health visitor, I went to group after group. Everyone said her latch looked fine and they left me to it. Breastfeeding was so painfull for the first 6 weeks that I would bite on a sock while I fed my daughter. My partner would come home from work to a screaming baby and me crying that I couldn't feed her anymore. The pain eventually decreased at 8 weeks and was more manageable.\nMy daughter fed every 20 minutes all day and every couple of hours at night until she was 13 weeks old, when it mercifully extended to every 45 minutes. I would feed her, put her in the car, drive to the shops. and by the time we arrived I would need to feed her again. My house was in chaos and there was nothing I could do but sit on the sofa and feed my daughter.\nWe moved areas to Norfolk when she was around 3 months old. My new health visitor said she didn't think I should be breastfeeding as it looked like trouble, which was hardly what I needed to hear.\nNot one of these health professionals thought my daughters constant feeding was cause for concern. A friend mentioned tongue tie as a possible cause for her issues, so I rang my health visitor to find out more. They palmed me off on my GP, who said as she had got to 5 months with no weight issues they wouldnt treat it. So I paid for a private evaluation of my daughters feeding, we said a lactation consultant who is also the infant feeding coordinator of the local hospital. She has been a godsend. She refered us to a brilliant surgeon and he fixed my daughters tie.\nSo now I have a baby that has gone from constantly feeding, with obviously painful hiccups, wind, never ending drool, sucking blisters on her lips, frequently green stools, I would have to use the flipple technique for every latch and even then she would pop off and/or I would have to adjust her latch 2/4 times in any 5-10 minute feed.\nWell now she latches effortlessly, she only drools when teething, rarely hiccups and has lovely bright yellow/orange baby poo. The blisters are gone and she feeds every 2-3 hours day and night. It has changed our lives and I'm finally able to enjoy my daughter. No thanks to the NHS.", "Thank you for your comment. We are sorry to learn of your experience.

I am extremely fortune that I have an excellent GP practice.\nThis week I have found out by reading my consultant a Cardiff CMHT latest letter to my GP that she has changed my diagnosis from bi polar disorder to personality disorder. Not only I have not had any discussion around this, (even though at my last appointment my advocate specifically asked that we wanted to know if she was having any thoughts of changing my diagnosis and she did not mention anything), I have not even been informed, finding out only by reading a letter which is not even addressed to me but to my GP. I find it despicable that in 2015 any patient should be finding out about a change of diagnosis in this manner. I do not think it would be considered acceptable in any other area of medicine, for people to find out about a cancer diagnosis or a heart condition in this way would be considered outrageous. I do not think mental health should be any different. and from speaking to people close to me and also my advocate it seems that they agree with me and they would also feel the same way. However when I expressed these thoughts to the psychologist I was told that the letter has triggered a schema so this reaction is being interpreted as everything by the team seems to be now as evidence of personality disorder. I find the whole concept of personality disorders contentious and it seems once a psychiatrist has applied this label to you you are placed in a catch 22 situation as I have described above. The NICE guidelines state that the person should be involved and informed of the diagnosis which I clearly have not been.\nSince I was sectioned in 2013 I have felt that using mental health services is the same as being in some kind of prison and in many ways this is what being sectioned feels like to me. However I never felt this way as an out patient until I started using this current team. Another way I feel placed in a catch 22 situation is that I have had to deal with staff being very rude, staring at me, not introducing themselves during phone calls so I was not sure who I was speaking too, receptionist who became aggressive when I politely and calmly asked why my appointment was for 4 months instead of 3 and on top of this when I was prepared to try and trust CPNs again I was abused again as soon as the door was shut. Yet if I point out that this behaviour is rude and unpleasant I am again told that my reaction is to do with my personality.\nThe contrast between my interaction with my CMHT who are supposed to be highly trained specialist professionals and my interaction with the staff at the private gym I go to is huge. Going to the gym was really important to me when I was ill, particularly being able to swim. My experience of the staff had already been very positive over a period of nearly a year so when I knew I was starting to become unwell I asked to speak to a member of staff in private and explained that I suffer from bi polar disorder and was not well but it was important to me to keep coming to the gym. They were totally professional and also very kind and went out of their to help, letting me use their phone on reception at times to contact my family. My family commented on how helpful and caring they were and how different this was from the mental health services. Another contrast for me was also that the gym staff are always extremely courteous to me and I feel I treat them in the same way\nMy family and those close to me share my fears about future care as if they are denying that I suffer from psychosis then how will they provide appropriate support when I go through this?\nThere is a letter in my notes from doctor, now from , a professor right at the top of his field who I saw for a second opinion a few years ago. He does not change my diagnosis from bi polar. Not only did he diagnosis me as suffering from bi polar disorder in the first place, he also treated me for the following 8 or 9 years and for much of that time he saw me as frequently as every 4 weeks and this was what I needed to stay out of hospital. And I was diagnosed in the first place after being sectioned so there was plenty time to observe what was happening to me. As well as being observed my consultant asked me detailed questions about what I believed was happening to me ( this is in stark contrast to my experience of being sectioned in 2013 when no one asked me any questions about my thoughts and feelings). I believed I was on some kind of quest and that I had developed powers of telepathy which made me a terribly special person. I told him all this. I hardly see how these ideas fit with a diagnosis of personality disorder. It seems clear that they were grandiose and delusional ideas and beliefs.\nAlso this latest letter from the consultant at the CMHT does seem to contain a major contradiction. There is a lengthy paragraph dealing with our conversation about reducing my dose of anti psychotic medication. She says that I was able to weigh up that reducing it may make me more prone to a relapse to do with my mood. Form this paragraph it seems clear that she thinks I need to be on a high dose of a drug that is licensed both as an anti psychotic and a mood stabiliser from which it seems logical to conclude that I have an illness which affects mood and has psychotic features and that this drug is helpful in controlling that.\nSo how would she go about explaining that she goes on to say that the team at the CMHT have not observed any symptoms of bi polar disorder in 2014 and that what I call psychosis is in fact a paranoid thinking style associated with personality disorder. My psychotic symptoms only occur with extreme mood swings. I am not troubled by them at any other times. Also when the symptoms stop usually after taking high does of anti psychotic drugs I gain insight into the fact that I have been suffering form paranoia and psychotic. If it was a paranoid thinking style associated with personality disorder surely it would be how I think all the time and I would not have any insight into it\nAlso in my view the team have been remarkably unobservant. My consultant offered no follow up appointment as I have said in my last story even though I told her I had needed to increase to the maximum dose and needed the maximum dose of lorazopam and had been the victim of a crime on a bus late at night which happened because I was unwell and the \u201c I might get stabbed\u201d mechanism did not kick in. Since she told me just to come back in 3 months she did not see me as I went through a psychosis for the whole of that time period and when I attended the next appointment I tried to tell her about it. However she did not include any of this in her letter to my GP and wrote completely inaccurate evidence that I told her I had had fleeting thoughts of thinking people were other people. What I actually said when she asked me if the thoughts were fleeting was very clearly that no they were not, they were thoughts that lasted weeks. My Dad was with me and can confirm this. He also told me that he thought I made it very clear to her that I had been experiencing psychotic symptoms. I have never felt able to attend an appointment with her alone and at every other appointment I have had an advocate with me.\nI also feel she is being highly selective in whose opinion she is seeking. She does not seem to be listening to my GP with whom I have an extremely trusting relationship for nearly 20 years and that relationship has survived him sectioning me twice, the first occasion being the first time he ever met me. After being sectioned in 2013 when he told me we were able to shake hands. And as I have said already she seems to be dismissing the opinion of my first consultant who knew me for far longer than she has done and gave me appointments far more regularly as well. The head of pharmacy also has a good grip on what I have been through and as I said in my last story it was a meeting with her that meant I was able increase my medication and not end up sectioned as I did in 2013. however it seems the team have not included her, they invited her to a case conference but only gave her about 2 days notice and she was on leave and could not make it. And I think since then they have not sought her opinion and my consultant told me she was not happy with me contacting them. I'm not sure what I was supposed to do though as I could not access any support through her or the rest of the team. 3 other consultants also did not express any thoughts that my diagnosis was incorrect.\nMy consultant has refused my request for a second opinion despite the fact that we have an academic team locally who offer this service and as I understand it there is no cost to the referer for the service. She says there is no need as a currently stable not understanding that given that I only have 48 hours to act to avoid becoming life threatening unwell it does not make sense to wait for a crisis to seek this opinion and I would rather know what future drug options there are when I am well and able to understand and ask questions and carry out my own research. This is what I have always done over the past 19 years and it has worked well for me and means that when I am committed to a treatment option I am committed and do not just stop taking medication suddenly. While this drug is working better for me than anything else has we do seem to be needing higher doses and for longer periods of time which makes me wonder if eventually even the highest dose won't control things.\nthe NICE guidelines as far as I can see specify 2 different personality disorders, borderline and anti social. She has used neither of these terms so I am unsure what her diagnosis is exactly. The following was the NICE guidelines for borderline personality disorder that anti psychotic drugs were not recommended for treatment of personality disorders and any medication should only be prescribed in the short term for no longer than one week. talking treatments were recommended. So if her diagnosis of personality disorder is correct I should therefore be able to come off my medication. There is no way I would do this because I know that I need it to stay alive.\nThe only time I have acted on suicidal thoughts was when I took 2 overdose in one week at a time when I had again been left to deal with a severe manic relapse without support from my CMHT and because the manic phase was very severe and not well controlled the low was also very severe and came on very quickly. I had come off medication prior to this, although I did do so under strict medical supervision from my first consultant. I had been paying for private counselling as at that time it seemed the only way I could access talking treatment and the counsellor had convinced me that by doing this I had \u201crecovered\u201d so I came off medication and also got a paid job. By the time I became ill my consultant who I respected and had an extremely good relationship had left, so this was the first time I had to deal with it without him and I took a very serious overdose and could have died. I attended an appointment with my new consultant while still an in patient at the poisons unit and I think she just said come back in 3 months. I felt ashamed of what I had done but had no one to talk to about how I felt. The reason I overdosed in the first place was because I thought I had failed. I had tried all sort of medication that had not worked and I had tried talking treatment yet still I was very ill and I had failed to hold down a job. I was 30. I had spent 10 years battling and being very ill I thought my whole life would be the same as the previous ten years and I could not face any more. It was not a cry for help or attention. The week I spent in the poisons unit was so awful that the reason I did not try again was because I could not face also failing at dying and the thought of ending up back there again was also terrible. So I grit my teeth and spent the next couple of months living at my parents house so I had no chance to be alone and overdose again. I do not have a history of constantly self harming and overdosing. But my thoughts of needing medication to stay alive are not melodramatic.\nThe fact hat this did happen once at the time when I felt very unsupported by services does make me and the people close to me concerned, on top of everything described already in my previous 2 stories.\nAnd although I am now glad that I did not die my 30s have certainly been no picnic either. However I did manage again to access excellent support from a pharmacist who was already known to me as she had taken a role in giving me information about medication options and when I contacted her again she told me she was now qualified to prescribe under guidance agreed with a consultant. So once again I felt safe and supported with very regular contact from someone who was very knowledgeable, conscientious and easy to get on with. The only reason this support ended was that she went on maternity leave and decided not to come back to work. Within a few months of losing this support I ended up sectioned. (See first story)\nI am an expert patient. I feel that I have had to become one in order to have any quality of life at all. To manage for 17 years without an effective mood stabler and with mood swings that come as rapidly as mine do I have had to learn to recognise early warning signs and have anti psychotics in the house so that I can be the one who makes the decision when to start them. The only time I did not know how to do this myself I ended up sectioned having avoided this for 17 years. One of the things that I feel was so positive about the relationship I had with my first consultant was that he was encouraging of me managing things myself and he taught me to trust my own judgement, having first taught me how to identify early warnings signs etc. I thought this was the principal behind newer initiatives such bi polar education programmes which I think were first developed in Cardiff. However I feel that one of the reasons I have run into such problems accessing services in the last 2 years since the pharmacist left is that mental health services in reality cannot cope with expert patients. They certainly don't seem to be used to them and they seem to me to respond by becoming defensive and turning me away and thinking that if I am able to explains things I cannot really be as ill as I am claiming to be. I cannot unlearn what I have learnt and I see no reason to. I think it is very valuable and has kept me alive long enough to have now found a drug which does work better for me, although I have still had 3 serious relapses on it. And I am frustrated by the assumption that by current consultant has made that because I have not responded to standard treatment that somehow it must be that the diagnosis is wrong. It could be but not necessarily. I feel we should be dealing with evidence.\nMy understanding was that western medicine is evidence based. There are other facts which the team seem to be ignoring. I spent \u00a33000 while I was unwell last year. This is half the all the money I owned in the entire world. I did things like spend over a \u00a3100 on soft toys. This is not a decision I would have made if I had been rational. TO me clearly this is evidence of a manic spending spree. I do not normally spend money like this and I live within my means which is why I did have this money in savings. I have spent money unwisely when I have ill before but never thousands. Before it was limited to hundreds but this relapse went on for 3 months.\nI do not sleep at all at these times. I experience pressure of speech and other things that are well known symptoms of mania. Also my history shows that I swing from these states quickly into depression which is classic bi polar. The team have not seen these lows but that is because quetirepine works really well at preventing that and I have explained this to them.\nI also have very definite danger times when I might become manic, which are always around the times when the clocks change so I am now approaching a danger time as the days are becoming longer and it is ironic that the people who are supposed to be providing support are actually just causing me stress at a time when I really don't need it. Again I don't see how being so effected by changes in light fist with personality disorder.\nAnd I have been sectioned twice because I was a danger to myself but not because I was suicidal. Again I don't see how this fits with personalty disorder. Also the NICE guild-lines state that personality disorders can occur and be diagnosed in conjunction with other conditions such as depression, eating disorders and bi polar disorder so it is not an either or situation. This makes sense to me as all of us expect that we can more than physical illness or ailment that can occur at the same time so why should people be limited to only one mental health diagnosis? This was my understanding of my situation before I read the letter, that no one disputed the bi polar diagnosis but following the assessment from the psychologist the team recognised that I did have additional difficulties which could benefit from treatment with the psychologist. I also made it clear to the psychologist form the outset that I was uncomfortable with the whole concept of personality disorders and labels in general and just wanted to work on solving problems.\nEverything I have said here about my history can be confirmed by reading my notes. My consultant told me to my face in the presence of my advocate when I asked her if she had read my notes that she did not have time to read my notes, she was only able to offer me time during clinics. After saying this to me she went on to write a letter to my GP which said I had \u201caccused\u201d her of not reading my notes. Close reading of this letter told me that nowhere did she say she had read them. I \u201caccused\u201d her of nothing. I pointed out she had not read my notes and she agreed that she had not.\nI do not have any answers, but as the patient I feel I don't have to any, that is perfectly acceptable for me to be asking questions, and I have been left very confused by reading this letter and my own research. I feel I have been patient and constructive with the team. So when I found out that they did not understand I had been psychotic I spent a great deal of time trying to explain this to them and put things in writing. I asked for a meeting with the integrated manager but she did not respond and later said she thought everything had been dealt with. Approximately 3 weeks ago she said she wanted a chat with me but gave me only an hours notice and my journey to the CMHT on public transport takes nearly an hour. We had a 10 minute meeting and I said I would like a further meeting with my advocative present. She agreed to this and asked me to get some dates form my advocate. It has taken appropriately 3 weeks to set this up for a date 4 weeks ahead. My next appointment in March is not with the consultant but with the registrar. When I agreed to a change of doctor it was not explained clearly to me and what I thought I was being offered and accepting was a change of consultant. The manager told me it was up to me who I saw but I was unaware at this point that my consultant had attempted to change my diagnosis in this manner. I was told I could ask if there were any appointments with her which I have done to be told that are not any. So I have no opportunity to discuss any of this with her face to face. I have been keen all year to express my needs very clearly so that I can get appropriate support to avoid becoming unwell as mentioned in my first story. Yet all my attempts to do this seem to being hampered so that here I am posting on a public website because I am left feeling that this is the only way to be heard right now.", "Hello Dragonvoice\r\nI am really sorry to read of your experiences and have spoken to the Clincal Board Nurse for Mental Health Services about your posting.

I was prepared for surgery early the following morning and told to wait. It wasn't until 3. 45pm later that day that I was told that my operation had been cancelled for the second time. This was due to another operation which had taken longer to perform than anticipated and my surgeon had basically run out of time so I was told to go home.\r\nI was not given a rescheduled date for my operation, in fact I've not had any correspondence initiated by my consultant or his team. I have rang various people and been given the run-around. I've been in touch with PALS and even they can't seem to get any answers.\r\nIt's been over 28 days since my operation was cancelled and still no word. I am of the understanding that patients whose operations are cancelled at the last minute, and who are not offered a new date that falls within 28 days of the original operation, may select a hospital of their choice at which to receive surgery. Is this true?\r\nBecause of the lack of information and care, I have resorted to writing a letter of complaint to the Chief Executive of the hospitals trust and expect some kind of written apology/acknowledgement and a hopefully a new date for my surgery soon, I will not hold my breath!\r\nI've mentally prepared myself for months as its quite a painful procedure, I had a similar operation on 2010 and know what to expect, its not pleasant! ! ! . I've had a lot of time off work sick because of my condition and I am worried that because this is dragging on for so long will it will have a decremental effect on my career prospects. I feel stressed, worried, and extremely disappointed by the NHS. I feel nobody cares about me and I really don't know what to do next.", "In the early hours of Sunday morning in January I was admitted to S. E. A. U with severe lower abdominal pain. I was told that a surgeon would come and assess me within the hour. \nThroughout the day I became extremely distressed with the amount of pain I was experiencing, which got worse as the minutes/hours ticked by. As the day went on, I was still awaiting a visit from the surgeon. All through this time I received extremely good care from the nurses. I appreciate that a Sunday is a particularly difficult day to manage due to a lack of much needed services such as (what would not not normally be a problem) a simple scanning device. \nI was admitted at 8. 30 in the morning with a view to seeing a Dr A. S. A. P as I was in obvious pain and distress. It wasn't until roughly 4. 30 that day that a surgeon finally came to assess me, by which time my appendix had perforated and had become gangrenous. I was then operated on and was transferred to Greetwell ward late on that evening. \nI am by no means complaining about my treatment. I am so grateful to the all the medical staff involved in my treatment and care, to whom without them I probably wouldn't be here now! ! ! I would just like to particularly thank the young male nurse who looked after me when I was particularly \"too far gone to even comprehend what was occurring\". \nHe gave me Morphine jabs, which just made me even sicker, and was just generally brilliant. He saw how sick I was and went to find the Doctor himself, and I genuinely believe if he hadn't have done that, I wouldn't be here to tell my story. I don't remember his name, which infuriates me, because I really think he went beyond his call of duty to deliver an amazing standard of care. \nAll I remember is he was young, dark haired and an extremely good nurse.

The email address is pals@midyorks.nhs.uk", "I am writing to you regarding my husband who was diagnosed with Pancreatic Cancer at the end of last year. I should say I believe in the NHS, however we as a family are extremely angry and disappointed with the care my husband received during the investigation and diagnostic stages of this disease.\n\nMy husband was admitted to hospital at the end of last year. We feel that his diagnosis was delayed. It took 3 weeks from the date of his admission until we were informed of his diagnosis. My daughter in law and myself both contacted the hepatobiliary surgery department to complain that an ERCP would require over a week's wait as an inpatient. This was ultimately the crucial diagnostic test performed after 2 suspicious scans were undertaken. \n\nIt was only after our intervention the wait was shortened to just a few days instead of the following week. I appreciate that investigations may require some wait but given the nature of this test and the circumstances under which it was being performed, this was too long. It is also not clear how a space was found to have this investigation performed after we queried such a long wait.\n\nThe issue that upsets us most is both the manner in which my husband was informed he had cancer and the plans for how his future care would be approached. \n\nMy husband's care was overseen by, a consultant surgeon at Glasgow Royal Infirmary. After my husband's inpatient investigations were completed he was discharged home with an outpatient appointment.\n\nWe saw the consultant at this appointment and I can say that this consultation made us feel like we were nothing more than a number. While it must be difficult to break such bad news, there seemed to be a real lack of any compassion. Indeed the 'bad news' came in almost the same breath that he discussed significant improvements in my husband's condition. We left the consultation less than 10 minutes after we went in and advised that we should direct other questions to a nurse. The nurse was very pleasant but didn't have the information we wanted.\n\nThe consultant briefly discussed that the cancer was 'inoperable' due to it spread around a vessel and the Beatson Oncology department would now deal with my husband. The consultant did say there was a very slight chance that they may see my husband back after chemotherapy but did not want to build our hopes up. As you can imagine, this was a devastating blow to our family and in particular to my husband.\n\nMy family and I later explored several second opinions from surgeons in other parts of the UK and in continental Europe. These opinions included leaders in this field in Germany and in London. Two separate independent surgical teams deemed that surgery was an option for my husband. This included other NHS surgeons whom we consulted with privately.\n\nAs you can imagine, we were delighted with the glimmer of hope of a cure for my husband and he subsequently underwent a Whipples operation as a private patient in London. We now know that a very small number of people in my husband's position can survive but these chances are negligible unless they have surgery. Given this information, perhaps you can understand our anger at this not being offered by the consultant and the team at Glasgow Royal Infirmary. \n\nWe would like to know what justification there is for not attempting a potentially curative operation on my husband, who was perceived to an excellent surgical candidate by other surgeons due to his otherwise good health. Is it the case that the skills to perform this kind of surgery in the NHS in Scotland do not exist, or was the surgeon just not prepared to carry out the operation?\n\nI have read the UK has a dismal record for treating pancreatic cancer compared to other European states - unfortunately my husband's experience reaffirms it. I do understand clinical opinions vary, but perhaps the surgeon should not have described the case as clear cut as did when obviously it was not the case.\n\nI would also like the issue of sharing of information and my husband's medical records to be addressed. We contacted several surgical teams to provide us with an opinion and each of them required their own copy of my husband's CT scan and blood results. We contacted the surgeon's secretary late last year to initiate this process. We felt a degree of urgency in getting this information given our circumstances but also because an oncology appointment had been made and it would not be possible to have an operation once chemotherapy had started, until the course was completed some months later. The whole process was laborious, required multiple phone calls, several visits to the hospital, repeated form signing. We didn't receive any copies of the scan until the end of last year. The delay was due in part to no one other than the consultant apparently having authority to authorise our request, and the consultant  was not available for most of that week.\n\nThe service at the Princess Grace hospital in London was vastly different. We had long conversations with compassionate surgeons, the processes were slick and we even managed to have a copy of a CT scan performed there the day after the scan was done. \n\nI have a post op detailed letter to the oncologist in Glasgow and my husband's GP \u2013 at the start of this year that my husband had made an 'excellent recovery'. It was a stark contrast to our service in Glasgow.\n\nTo conclude I would greatly appreciate if you could investigate and seek answers. \n\nI reiterate I fully believe in the NHS. My family have never felt the need to use private medical care, sadly this is no longer the case. \n\nI copied in the First Minister Ms Sturgeon and the Health Secretary Ms Robison as I believe my husband's case would be of some interest to them. \n\nWe would be grateful if could help us address the above issues and the questions below.\n\n- Why was our experience at the Royal Infirmary so poor? Particularly issues such as waiting times and trying in vain to get my husband's CT scan on disk - at a time when we all were emotionally drained.\n\n- Why did the consultant and the Royal Infirmary describe the tumour as inoperable and how it was 'not a tumour that can be resected' when it was resectable according to other surgeons and has now been successfully resected? \n\nAlthough my husband has a long way to go, the fact he is doing well and that it was correct to operate to give him the best possible chance. \n\nHow many people have have died prematurely as they have held the view of their NHS surgeon as sacrosanct? How many more people in the future are going to have their tumour described as inoperable when it may not conclusively be the case?\n\nMany people simply could not afford to be treated privately. Indeed, I should state my husband has worked all his life paying National Insurance. He grew up in a Glasgow housing estate and has had to use his savings for a life saving operation. \n\nShould the NHS not be refunding him all costs incurred including flights to London?", "Dear Gee\r\nThank you for sharing a very considered and detailed account of the experiences your husband and your family have had following his diagnosis with pancreatic cancer.

NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde wishes to see these values lived and experienced in all of the patient interactions that occur and I apologise that this was not the case.\r\nYour posting also describes a very frustrating process of attempting to get hold of a copy of your husbands CT scan and blood results.

His left hand peripheral vision had been affected.

He was still disorientated and when admitted his blood pressure was through the roof. At the most severe level and risk of a stroke. We were given no after care and he was complaining of mild headaches for two weeks. Then two weeks later he was rushed to Whiston Hospital having experienced a mild stroke. \nWhiston have now given him the correct medication to deal with this type of blood pressure related stroke. Why didn't Warrington prescribe the blood pressure medication two weeks prior to him having the stroke? \nI am absolutely disgusted. I found the sister on the ward unapproachable and condescending.", "Response copied from original feedback from Patient Opinion in October 2014     Dear Southbank    I received your posting today following your experiences in the Rheumatology department. I am sorry to note that you have had a poor experience in the clinic and I have already spoken to PALs who you mentioned you had been in contact with. Please know that we have taken your feedback very seriously and as part of my immediate investigation I also noted you mentioned that you had already raised a complaint and received a response. It is sad to hear that you were unhappy with the result of your PALs response and that of the GMC. As I do not have that depth of clinical knowledge I am unable to comment, but understand from you that you are pursuing the appeals process.    Sadly I think I have also responded to a previous complaint from you, so it is even more disappointing to note that we have still not got things right for you. Because of this, I have spoken with our Clinical Director and we want to make every effort to ensure we do the right thing for every patient every time. We do not want to be seen as \u201cpen pushing\u201d, especially as our staff are dedicated and committed to doing the best for all of our patients. I appreciate it can be hard when you do not receive the response you may have hoped for and really hope you are now feeling much better.    Noting that you have cancelled all your future appointments, we do not want your care to be affected because of this event. Please do contact your GP, who may possibly be able to refer you to another Trust for your continued care, if you still do not want to come back to us. However, please know that you are welcome in the event you do return.    Please contact us again if we can be of any further assistance either by calling PALs on 01202 704886 or emailing them PALS@rbch.nhs.uk.  Kind regards  Sue", "My wife was diagnosed with diabetes at the age of three, so virtually all her life. In 2010 / 2011 she developed an ulcer on the back of her calf and should have been referred to specialist care but this did not happen. In 2011/2012 she picked up athlete's foot infection in both feet, although she was given medication for this she was not made aware of the danger the infection could pose if not properly treated and cared for. The infection developed into ulcers, the doctor came to see my wife at home as she was unable to walk and antibiotics were prescribed but he did not seem to be aware that my wife should have been referred for emergency treatment. The following day I called the doctor again as my wife was in severe pain. The doctor did not feel it was necessary to come and see my wife as he felt the antibiotics had not yet had a chance to take effect.\nHowever, he did come on the Friday after I had complained to the Health Board. This time he was accompanied by a nurse. The doctor examined my wife and was more concerned about the pain associated with the arthritis diagnosed in 2008 for which she was on long term steroids. He prescribed medication which was later found to be inappropriate as it was not suitable for someone with a fungal infection. The doctor left after writing out this prescription\nThe nurse who had also come with the doctor suggested to the doctor my wife should be seen by a vascular consultant, however the doctor left after writing out a prescription. The nurse, who had stayed behind, called the local hospital and asked if it was possible for my wife to be given an appointment with the podiatrist, bearing in mind it was now 2: 00pm on Friday. An appointment was given for the following Tuesday, in the meantime another nurse came on Saturday to change my wife's dressings. On Sunday my wife was calmer and in less pain.\nThis all changed, on Tuesday it was not possible to take my wife to the hospital because she was in so much pain. I called the doctor who came and took blood tests and then left.\nThe following Monday the doctor phoned to say my wife should be taken to hospital straight away as she was very sick. I took her to hospital in the car although I feel an emergency ambulance should have been sent for her. It turned out that my wife had renal failure and heart failure.\nThe hospital on the Isle of Lewis does not have a vascular surgeon, my wife was kept at this hospital for a week before being transferred to the mainland hospital in Inverness. Here she was in hospital for 8 months before a double amputation was performed, below the knees, due to gangrene. I now understand that diabetes is not described as severe but terminal when it reaches this stage.\nMy wife died in late 2014.\nI have since obtained my wife's medical records and am concerned that the notes do not reflect what actually happened. The doctor's notes following his home call after the athlete's foot infection stated that her foot was a bit red, cellulitis spreading infection. At this point alarm bells should have rung but my wife's condition was left untreated.", "Dear hiker167\r\nWe are sorry to hear about your situation, in particular that your wife sadly passed away.

I called 999 recently between 8. 00-8. 30am as I had been confused over night and had a pleuritic chest pain. The day before my GP advised me to go to local AMU or call 999 if I become worse.  GP said I possibly got PE or bad chest infection. When I called the 999 on the morning the woman who answered the call got my details and said she is going to get her co-ordinator to call me back in 60 minutes time. While I was waiting for them to call back my head was aching and I was shivering very badly. I was loosing control and my whole body felt like a jelly. The 999 co-ordinator called me back less than in hour and started to talk to me. She was just asking the standard text book questions which I managed to answer. She was on the phone about 15-20 minutes asking questions which were not relevant to my condition at all. After the standard text book questions she said \"well, you are talking to me and able to answer all the questions. can you get to the hospital by yourself? \" I told her that I am not fit to drive at that moment. she then asked me \"have you got someone to take you there? \" I replied, \"I have got a friend, but he is not well either\". She then said \" you dont have to go to hospital straight away, you have got all day to get there\". I was so disappointed and disgusted by her answer. At the same time, I knew there is something very bad happening in side my body and my dear friend noted I wasn't myself. We thought it was a waste of time calling 999 who have no clue of real illness. We quickly packed a bag and my dear friend who could hardly walk drove me to the A&E department. When we got to the A&E reception I could hardly walk as my both legs were aching so much and I was almost going to collapse. The receptionist in A&E were kind and booked me in. Few minutes later a young nurse called me into the triage room and as soon as she looked at me she knew I was in a life threatening state. she quickly checked my vital sings and got a brief history. My low blood pressure, raised heart beat and extremely high temperature scored a EWS of 8 at that time. Young nurse quickly put me into a wheel chair and rushed me into the A&e RESUS where I was dignosed with life threatening infection and given various IV antibiotics, IV fluids, anti emetics and IV paracetamols to stabilise my life. If I listen to the 999 co-ordinator who assessed me by text book questions and waited to come to A&E in the afternoon I would have died and I would have not been here to tell the world my story today. I am very grateful for the A&E staff who saved my life, but I am very disgusted and disappointed about the 999 co-ordinator who throw text book questions at me for 20 minutes rather than sending me an ambulance to go the A&E.", "I am sorry that you have had cause to raise concerns about East of England Ambulance Service. I would like to investigate the concerns you have raised and would be grateful if could email eoeasnt.feedback@nhs.net with the date and the location you called us from so that I can trace call and the staff involved and begin an investigation if you would like us to do so.\r\nKind regards\r\nMarian Burgess", "I am so sorry to hear of your experience. We would really like to talk to you to get some more details of what happened so we can look into this. If you can please get in touch via patient.experienceteam@whh.nhs.uk\r\nI hope your partner is feeling much better now and recovering well.", "I had been suffering with UTI's for over six weeks and after four different courses of antibiotics, prescribed by a local walk-in centre, and eventually acute kidney pain, I was rushed into Darent Valley hospital one Monday morning.\nLuckily, with a letter from the walk in centre stating the urgency and the level of pain I was in, I was seen to fairly quickly. The A&E waiting room was overcrowded and with no where to sit, people were sitting on the floor and crowding the corridors.\nI had my blood taken from a nurse who hit a nerve in my arm and was extremely unconcerned telling me to 'shhh' when I screamed at her to pull it out and that something was wrong. As I'd never heard of this happening before, as I cried in pain, I questioned the nurse as to what happened. She quickly dismissed me saying it's nothing to worry about and told me to go and sit back in A&E.\nAfter what seemed like a lifetime, I was given a pain relief suppository prescribed by a doctor, who asked my symptoms and history and typed then into a computer. He asked if there was a possibility I could be pregnant, to which I told him I hadn't yet had my period, although it was unlikely. I was then sat back in the A&E waiting room for a further hour until the doctor returned to tell me I needed a CT scan and was moved to this department where I was relieved to find a comfortable chair in the corridor as the pain relief had made me drowsy.\nIt was over two hours before anyone even spoke to me, and I was taken in for my CT scan to which a woman asked beforehand if I'd had a pregnancy test done. I told her I hadn't, but a doctor had mentioned I needed one earlier. The CT scan went ahead without the pregnancy test and I was once again told to sit back in A&E and await the results of my scan.\nThere was an announcement to say that the waiting time in A&E was now over three hours, and when I'd realised I'd been sitting back there for almost three hours, found a nurse and asked what was going on. She said they had been looking for me. Which I found hard to believe, as I'd been sitting in A&E on and off for what was now eight long hours. I was moved to what the nurse described as a 'comfortable chair' while she went to find the doctor to tell me the results. 15 minutes later the doctor took me aside, told me the CT scan was clear, prescribed me another course of antibiotics, as all of the previous courses had failed, and sent me home.\nNeedless to say, once the pain relief had fully worn off, the following day I was in unbearable acute pain in my lower back, which led to an ambulance rushing me back to Darent Hospital. When talking to the paramedic on the way to the hospital (who had given me a dosage of morphine to put me at ease) he told me that the previous evening, the A&E waiting list had grown to over eight hours. The pain was increasing, which was worrying to the paramedic as the morphine should have by now taken the pain away.\nI was crying in agony, not able to sit still by the time I reached the hospital. The paramedic sat me on a chair and went to the A&E reception to hand in my details and push for me to be seen by a doctor. He was told to sit me in the A&E waiting room, which I had expected. I was humiliated that everyone in the room was looking at me as I was sobbing so much and wriggling around in so much agony. About 45 minutes later, I could no longer stand the increasing pain so I rushed to the toilet as I thought this could be down to my bladder being full from the water the paramedic had told me to drink. On my way (still crying and could hardly get my words out) I asked a nurse if she could get me a urine sample pot as I already knew that the pain of passing urine was unbearable and wanted to get this out of the way.\nWhen waiting for the bathroom, another patient was concerned about the amount of pain I was in and asked if there was anything she could do, while doctors and nurses rushed passed me, ignoring my agony. Only now did I realise how lucky I had been the previous day to be seen to straight away. Upon giving my sample to the nurse, she recognised me asking if I was there yesterday. She rushed to speak to someone telling them I needed to jump the queue and be seen next.\nMy friend finally arrived to keep me company and was shocked by how pale but sweaty I was, how much pain I was in and how I hadn't yet been seen to. She went to see someone and I was finally called into a side room, where a man asked me how the triage staff could be of service to me. His casual question shocked me as I was stressed and quite clearly in a serious amount of pain. He asked me question after question, ignoring my cries, to which my friend told him it was probably more beneficial if he read my notes, which were on the table in front of him. When realising I had been in A&E twice in two days, rushed in via ambulance, and had already been given morphine which had not taken away the pain, he managed to get me a bed in what I assumed was still the A&E department. A doctor saw me, gave me a drip of pain relief, felt my stomach and back and realised I had a rash all the way up my spine. It struck me that the previous day, the doctor hadn't even looked at my back.\nThe doctor said it was my appendix referring my pain to the other side and wanted to prepare me for surgery, also mentioning an urgent need for an ultra sound, as a matter of priority. It all sounded very serious, I was taken to CDU where I contacted my family (who all live in the North East of England) to tell them I was going into theatre for an operation to remove my appendix. A nurse, who was extremely concerned about why I wasn't admitted the previous day, told me a doctor would be with me very soon.\nAfter a couple of hours, I still hadn't seen a doctor and when a man with a trolley offered me food, I accepted having not eaten all day. Halfway through my sandwich the nurse returned to tell me I wasn't allowed to eat as I was 'nil by mouth' which I hadn't been told. By this point, the pain was starting to return with aggression, but as I hadn't been 'clarked' I was turned down pain relief after several requests.\nI waited six hours for the surgeons to arrive (at 1am) who spent less than 5 minutes examining me and quickly dismissed the fact it was my appendix, claiming I needed the medical team. Three hours later, at 4am the medical team came, prescribing me IV antibiotics for a kidney infection and admitting me to the hospital.\nI was Penicillin and then told that I was allergic, as a rash covered my body shortly after. However this was never written on my notes.\nFinally, on the Thursday, they tested me for pregnancy, and thankfully (since I'd already had a CT scan) I wasn't pregnant. I was given strong pain relief throughout my time in the hospital so I was very much out of it, and drowsy and had no idea whether I was getting any better or worse. By the fourth day I was being given so many different tablets, I had no idea what they were for, and as no one was reading my notes, didn't trust them and hid the tablets.\nAt 8am on Friday I was told I was being discharged by a doctor who I had never seen in the whole time I was in the hospital. I cried, saying I need some answers. What if it comes back? What caused it? Why did it take four lots of antibiotics?\nThe nurse told me to sit by the window until my medication was ready as they needed my bed for another patient. I was told I was been given more antibiotics (now on my fifth course) and being referred to the urologist as an outpatient as a matter of urgency. It wasn't until after 6pm that same day, when my medication was ready and I was allowed to leave.\nI left the hospital without knowing what caused the agony I was in, why my infection hasn't cleared after six weeks and if there is a bigger problem I needed to be worried about.\nI feel this hospital is overpopulated, understaffed and a worrying place to be. The A&E department is unbelievable, with staff forgetting that people's life are at risk here. There was no rush even though there were so many people in so much pain, waiting to be seen. It seems to me that the staff I saw are so used to the hospital being this way that it has become almost normal to be rude and desensitized.\nIt baffles me that they thought my appendix was about to burst, yet it took six hours for a doctor to see me and even then, inform me it wasn't anything to do with my appendix.\nNobody read my notes, they prescribed me pain relief to disguise the 'bigger' problem and I am now terrified to ever return in another emergency as I didn't feel at all safe or looked after. Other patients around me were in the same boat and many unhappy and concerned about the service, lack of testing and professionalism.", "I'm so sorry to hear your news and that you feel the shortage of staff over the weekend impacted on the amount of care that was given to your father.

Yours sincerely Nadeem Moghal Medical Director", "It's been almost 3 years to the date and last month in April I finally received my new lovely bottom plate but have been unable to wear it for a full day as it's pinched. I have had to wait till today (6 weeks) to get a bit shaved off as my dentist has been away. I accept that all dentists deserve a holiday but there have been no available appointments until today. Any way hooray they are good so I am pleased with that.\r\nThis is not the end of my story it's about to start again with the top ones...I managed to get a new dentist at the same practise the one who completed my treatment for the bottom ones lovely guy seems that he has had years of experience.\r\nWhen I visited him in April he had to cut through my top bridge on the upper left side to meet the bite of the new bottom plate, this was ok, he explained that he would cut through the right hand side bridge on our nest visit and do the same treatment in preparation for the new top denture. I explained that this right hand side bridge and the tooth next to it would probably come out in fact one good pull and I could probably do it on my own, in April he assured me that this would not happen... in all his years as a dentist it had only happened once or twice! I was informed I would be left with 6 front top teeth and I'd need to leave these for 2 months to heal, thinkingt then he would have the new temporary top plate made take the remaining 6 teeth out and fit the plate at the same time, I would come back 6 months or so later when my gums had shrunk and have a nice new one made to match my at bottom ones.\r\nNo I arrived this morning the whole care plan appeared to have gone out the window he agreed that if he cut this one tooth out the rest would come out as well! ! As you can imagine I was devastated especially when he told me I would be toothless I had planned to go back to work after the extraction planning a paper work day ... I work within the NHS front line would a dentist practice expect the receptionist to be working with no teeth? . The dentist appeared like he was having a bad day and was put out because I refused to have these teeth all out today. He also stated there would be no temporary plate. I now have to explain to my employers that I'm probably going to be off for how ever long it takes for my gums to heal and then wait for the fitting and making of the new ones. I will basically have to go on the sick and hope I don't lose my job also speak with my GP...I feel like I'm coordinating my own care plan! I can't believe all this is happening again! ! : -(", "I have been asking for a second opinion from our local academic team who offer this service in management of complex psychiatric cases. There is no cost for the service to the NHS. I was seen by this service a few years ago and have tried everything that was suggested then so it seems to me perfectly logical to now go back. I have been requesting this for a year now.\nI have suffered from bi polar disorder for over 19 years and unfortunately I have not responded to standard treatments. I was extremely fortunate to have excellent care for the first 10 years or so from an academic consultant. And for many years following his departure I did have excellent care from a pharmacist who was qualified to prescribe under guidance from a consultant. However since she left over 2 years ago I have pretty much been left without any effective support and it in that have ended up sectioned and remaining unwell for an entire year and becoming severely unwell a year ago without anyone from my new CMHT realising what was happening to me (see previous 3 stories)\nThe Royal College of Psychiatrists say on their website that although there is no legal right to a second opinion everyone should be able to access one, especially if a significant decision has been made.\nI have not received a satisfactory explanation from my CMHT as to why my symptoms which all my family, friends and GP practice knew were symptoms of a manic relapse with psychotic symptoms was not picked up by them and why instead they have attempted to explain them as personality difficulties. My own self reporting once I was well enough has also been ignored. Given all this I do not have confidence in the medical team and this is another reason for seeking a second opinion.\nI have repeatedly been told that they see no need for a second opinion as I am currently stable. While this may be true right now, over the last 3 years I have suffered 3 serious relapses all with psychosis and all happened while I was taking medication as prescribed and on 2 occasions increasing it rapidly. Last year despite taking the maximum dose of an anti psychotics I was still experiencing psychosis for 3 months. This is very worrying for me. 3 years ago we were able to stabilise things much more quickly with a much lower dose. I am fearful of how we would manage another relapse. Given all this I hardly see that the argument that I am currently stable is robust. I have been asking for a medication crisis plan for the last year as well and this has also been refused with my then consultant saying there were many medication options and she would not commit to anything. This shows no understanding of quickly I can become unwell (evidence from 2013 when I ended up sectioned 6 days after I said I needed help to prevent this) it also shows no understanding of my medication history and there are not in fact many options because I have already tried most of them.\nI was also under the impression that this referral has already been made. I attended a meeting with the manager of my CMHT in March which was also attended by my advocate and the commissioner of the advocacy service who is an employee of the health board. The commissioner became involved after my advocate had outlined my situation in a meeting. The commissioner was very concerned and asked if she could attend this meeting. I thought that was a good idea. We again made this request for a second opinion form the academic team. The following day my advocate told me she had received a phone call from the commissioner who had told her she had spoken directly to the clinical director and had instructed her to instruct the CMHT to make the referral.\nNearly 2 months later and I had heard nothing. My advocate emailed the manager who replied saying that the medical team says there is no need. It is as if the above never happened. My advocate then copied the commissioner into an email and we are waiting for a response.\nI do not understand why they are so reluctant to follow good practice. There is no cost and since I have been referred previously there will already be a medication history in my notes and I have only tried one more drug since then so the referral would not require much work.\nThe Royal College of Psychiatrists also say on their website that the more manic episodes you have had the more likely you are to go on to have another one. Given that I have had so many manic episodes that I lost count about 15 years ago it seems to me very sensible to plan for the future rather than just wait until I do have another episode. It also seems sensible to me to look at future treatment options while I am well enough to understand and ask questions rather then when I am severely unwell.", "Dear Milbu\r\nWe were very sorry to see that you had such an unhappy experience when you visited our A&E Department.

I was admitted due to feeling incredibly suicidal and one of the nurses said to me that I wasn't suicidal, excuse me, try living 5 minutes in my head instead of being patronising. \nI was also allowed to go out for 15 minutes alone, but I was gone for over 2 hours offsite hurting myself; not one staff member noticed.

I took her to gp and the process between that and seeing correct mental health person took nearly 2 years. \n\nBy this time I was not allowed to be told anything and her behaviour had deteriorated and become very aggressive.

I have contacted the team twice and each time been told both the manager and duty worker are unavailable. The purpose of the referral was to ensure I had support, especially while my care plan is not being implemented in relation to care co-ordinator visits. Even if it did come under the formal complaints process (which it doesn't) I don't believe the submission of a formal complaint should be used to delay care.\nI am living in squalid conditions. I am malnourished. I am paying more than I should for utilities. My participation in education and social activities has disintegrated. I have missed/had to cancel necessary hospital investigations for physical health problems. My GP has had to prescribe me psychiatric drugs that have dangerous interactions with my physical health problems, just so I don't get more mentally ill. I live in a fog sleeping on the couch in the same clothes day after day too fatigued to carry out tasks of daily living. The resource centre would be able to provide housing and other support but instead it feels like I'm being left to rot. I realise TEWV is having difficulties assigning me a suitable care co-ordinator, but that should not stop them referring me to a mental health resource centre in the meantime.\nI am under section 117 aftercare. That means that of all patients with mental health problems I am in the group that is specifically meant to be protected from falling through the cracks in the system. 40 years ago, in my view, I would probably have been a long stay patient in an asylum. Community care was meant to be an improvement on that, not an excuse for cutting corners and leaving the most vulnerable patients in squalor. If this is the kind of care TEWV is giving to patients on enhanced care plans under s117 aftercare then I am scared about what would be the real situation for me if I wasn't on enhanced care. I am left feeling sad that the CQC didn't inspect the team I'm under when it assessed TEWV, because if it had maybe I would be protected from the kind of conditions I'm experiencing.\n\nThings that were good or could be improved include that PALS were easy to get hold of but there was an issue with them actually doing what they were asked to do. PALS should help patients liaise when an urgent referral is required  to provide support .  There should be policies, that go beyond acute crisis treatment,  to protect patients when there is no keyworker: S117 patients in particular should have arrangements that keep them safe from relapse and ensure referrals to other services to prevent or manage relapse are dealt with quickly. Team managers should do what they say they will do.", "I feel that there is a total lack of care and understanding, by both Bolton hospital and Greater Manchester West mental health trust of people with a serious, diagnosed mental health condition.\nThe response I had from my complaint to Bolton FT and GMWMHT about the care and understanding my son was denied when he went to Bolton A&E was apalling and just reinforced my initial views of these uncaring institutions. My son was diagnosed with schizophrenia 12 months prior to going to Bolton Hospital to seek help. Regrettably, he had taken amphetamine, to relieve his symptoms, 24hrs before his visit to hospital and this had put him in a highly psychotic state. He was very frightened and anxious. \nHe was honest and open to staff about what he'd taken, however, staff only focused on the substance misuse and dismissed the fact that he suffered from schizophrenia. He was told to go home and go to bed! Cutting a long story short he ended up in prison.\nI made a complaint and had a meeting with representatives from both Trusts but was very disappointed with the outcome. It would of been easier to get a straight answer from a politician. I felt that they defended their staff unconditionally and blamed my son, saying he should not of gone to the A&E department. If people with enduring mental health conditions can't receive help and support from staff in hospitals where do they go?", "This is a quote taken from patient:\n\" In my view the Doctors at a  local GP practice in Liverpool are not caring for patients or not doing their jobs (duties) properly. Three of the Doctors seen in initial three appointments did not treat me as the patient right, as a consequence I I was nearly left paralysed.\nI  went to hospital with referral from GP at last, and they hospitalised me right away on the same day. Lost confidence for people working as a Doctor & would like to question basic medical diagnostic knowledge of people working in our GP's\"\nA complaint is being made about the issue.", "I have had the quite frankly, misery of previously being under the care of the Child and Adolescent mental health team in Southampton. Over the 3/4 years spent working with them, I experienced 5 mental health nurses, 4 psychologists/therapists, 2 family therapists, 1 psychiatrist, 1 social worker and the senior director. It became one therapy after another; family therapy, cbt, cat, cat again, art, psychodynamic therapy.\nDuring these crucial adolescent years, I battled Anorexia which turned into severe bulimia, daily suicidal idealisation (combined with 5 general paediatric ward admissions), extreme self harm and self medication; alongside increasing hallucinations, audio delusions and psychosis symptoms. Looking back as a now recovered adult, I was extremely unwell and failed to receive the care I needed.\nOn many occasions, I was hours from death. Organ failure. Liver failure. Dehydration. Low pulse. Fainting. And at this point, with my parents refusing to have me at home, a psychiatrist informed the ward staff (Southampton general hospital) I was not to be spoken too. This was not the only occasion where my needs were ignored and I was left alone; fighting to keep myself alive with what little desire I had to live left. Reflecting, I became more and more unwell as I began seeing staff more and more. Being ignored and rejected, only made my mental and physical health decline.\nIf, at the age of 17 1/2, I had not made the impromptue decision to discharge myself from the service (after restricting heavily over the final months, slipping yet further into the black hole I was stuck in and refusing to attend sessions at all) I would never have recovered. I believe that CAMHS not only failed to adequately keep me safe; I was neglected as the severely mentally ill patient I was. My recovery was hindered and extended.  These events are now from around 4 years ago.", "Dear \u201ctryingtohelp\u201d\r\nAs a parent of a young woman who has experienced ill health for several years this of course must be distressing for you and you would want to find the most timely and appropriate support available for her.\r\nIt seems as this has been difficult to achieve as you tell us that it took a long time to get contact with a mental health practitioner, you didn't feel you were included in her care plan or discussions about her diagnosis.\r\nIt seems from your story that the situation is increasingly difficult for you and we would like to offer support to both you and your daughter.\r\nWe really hope that you can make contact with us via our Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS) Team.

Before Christmas I was sectioned by Stafford Police and taken to St George's Hospital in Stafford but the treatment I received there was so bad I am I made complaint and the complaint was dealt with by PALS, I am really not happy because again I was sectioned yesterday and sent home with no care my counselling is supposed to have been moved from primary to secondary but they have left me with nothing, I have nowhere to turn to when I have a meltdown, and the police keep sectioning me taking me to St George's and they just send me home", "I have been allocated a nurse from the fact team in Newark to provide care for my deteriorating mental health. Due to a crisis I had it was decided with the nurse and my psychiatrist that I needed an admission to an acute mental health unit. Unfortunately there were no beds available and after having been made to wait over three weeks with things continuing to deteriorate I was told they would stop looking and offer more intensive community support.\n\nAt this point my nurse rang me and informed me I could have one home visit and one appointment at staff base per week. However when then trying to arrange my home visit I was made to feel so guilty about the distance they would have to travel to see me that I said it was okay. The nurse instantly accepted this and said someone would be in touch for my next appointment.\n\nThe following week I was due to see the nurse and my psychiatrist which was arranged but I had to cancel. The nurse informed me this joint visit could be rearranged. That afternoon I had another crisis, resulting in me contacting the team. At this point I was told the previously offered appointment was no longer available and I couldn't be seen by anyone until the following week. I informed them I was highly suicidal and couldn't see beyond that day. Although I hung up at this point no attempts to contact me were made until days later.\n\nThe contact I had at this time was from the nurse who said they were ringing to see how i was and to arrange a visit. I requested I could have the previously offered home visit and the nurse said they would call back the following day to confirm. I then told the nurse I had been greatly struggling and had ended harming myself. The nurse responded by saying it was fine and they would confirm your appointment tomorrow. When I said this was not fine it was scary and distressing and I was still feeling panicky about it the nurse said they did not have time to talk about it as the nurse was going out on visits and hadn't intended on it being a therapeutic phone call. I was upset about this as I felt ignored, not believed and like I wasn't important and didn't matter. I asked why the nurse had rang and asked how I was if the nurse didn't have time to talk and the nurse said they weren't prepared to have me question competencies as a  nurse. I calmly told the nurse I wasn't doing this and I just wanted some validation of the hard time Id had with no support from the team. \n\nThe nurse then asked whether the conversation was finished, to which I answered no and asked why the nurse was getting defensive, but at this point the nurse just said we will confirm the appointment tomorrow and that the nurse needed to end the call.\n\nI then rang to speak to the fact team manager to discuss these concerns but I was informed the manager was in a meeting that day and would get back to me. I am still waiting.\n\nThe home visit was arranged but on the morning it was due I had a phone call stating two staff members had called in sick so they could not make it. I was not offered any telephone support or the offer of the meeting at staff base. I said I couldn't think about the following week as I had some big stressful things due to happen so the conversation was ended with an agreement someone would call me the following week.\n\nI feel totally let down and uncared for by my nurse and the team. It's increased my social isolation, my anxiety and agitation, my low mood and suicidal thoughts as well as impacting on my family. My mum is struggling to provide care for me and the nurse assured her three weeks ago that she would put some urgent carers support in place. This has not happened and has not been mentioned since. I really hope changes can be made so others aren't forced to suffer similar situations.", "I am very sorry that you feel let down by the team and have had a negative experience.

She had underlying heart problems but six months before was told nothing had become worse. She was told by her GP she would not die from what she had and a doctor at the Royal said she would be dancing out of there. She was kept in weeks after transfusion. Don't understand why they were getting her blood correct as she was on warfarin before procedure. I got a call one day saying she had a bacterial infection causing inflammation in the blood but they couldn't find the source. Over a week later they had found nothing further and she seemed to be getting a bit better on her own. They were not concerned. Then she had a fall her blood pressure was very low, I went to see her she was on oxygen and very drowsy they said no need for concern. Next day they said she was unsettled but they were not overly worried that night I went in they said her organs were failing due to this infection they couldn't find. They put her on antibiotics saying she had a fifty fifty chance. She died the next day to my shock. How could this happen? I think they left it too late for antibiotics to work. How can you die from a blood transfusion? It's killing me not knowing why this happened. Can't live with this hurt.", "Dear Kermitcutie,\r\nFirst of all, I would like to offer my heartfelt sympathies to you \u2013 I can only imagine what you must be going through in dealing with the loss of your Mum, which under such unexpected circumstances must be even more upsetting for you.

Following an initial assessment by a lovely social worker we were then referred to the Child in Need Service where we happy to engage with services. \nI also referred my daughter to CAMHS (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services) for treatment for severe anxiety. She has a diagnosis of school phobia, & anxiety disorders. I asked for help from children's services because I have complex health needs. I was told no funding. I'm on home haemodialysis. I discovered that last year that confidential information was being shared by the RMN (Registered Mental Nurse) from CAMHS with my daughter's school, so I recently requested copies of my daughter's medical records.  My renal team were not present at this meeting and I actually have medical evidence from my renal team disputing non compliance. I'm outraged that CAMHS seem to think they have the right to make comments about my medical treatment without the facts and share this personal information with others without consent. I don't feel that despite so called confidentiality claims, they keep your information safe \nI was told my daughter was a CIN because of her mental health problems. I also signed a form that was an agreement from CIN on their part that if there were any safeguarding concerns I would be informed about this. We continued to engage and I attended all CIN meetings despite not always feeling well.   As a result I no longer trust CAMHS with our personal information.\n\nRecently I requested copies of my daughter's mental health records to discover a safeguarding meeting had took place without my knowledge citing the reason as emotional abuse based on what felt like hearsay by the school, citing we hadn't engaged with the Child and Adolscent Mental Health (CAMHS) Team and non compliance with my own treatment. Now I was completely upset and livid at these allegations as my daughter & I had fully engaged with CAMHS and there was no evidence from my healthcare team to state I had been non compliant.\nThey have also cited incorrect comments about my daughter and I refusing an autism test when in fact she had this test last year which the RMN was present for!\n I also wouldn't have asked for help from children's services in the first place if I knew I was going to be accused of emotional neglect.  My experience caused me not to trust the CIN service.  I felt that they acted in a very unprofessional and underhand way. We ask for help from these services to be told there is no funding then get accused of child abuse.  In my view a disgusting way to treat the most vulnerable in society.", "My cousin has recently been diagnosed with bipolar II, after years of being treated for depression, anxiety and OCD. On giving the diagnosis, her doctor withdrew her medication and left her to deal with it on her own - no support, no counselling, only the assurance that she was \"on a waiting list\" for an assessment, which could take 18 months.\nA few weeks later I went to stay with her. She has been writing a play about mental health to try and raise awareness, and had just heard she'd been rejected for an arts grant. When I went to see her in the morning, she told me she hadn't slept, and that she wanted to die. She was crying. I hugged her, told her to get some sleep, and we'd talk properly about it later. Next thing - she knocked on my bedroom door, telling me she'd taken an overdose. I immediately rang NHS Direct, who got an ambulance to her in half an hour. The paramedics were professional and kind, and insisted on taking her into hospital even though she'd vomited by this time and kept saying, \"They won't do anything to help me anyway. \"\nWe got to A&E, where she was assessed, had an ECG and was put in a private room in the observation ward - pretty dismal, with no natural light or even windows. A nurse came to take her vitals, listed the pills she'd taken. After a couple of hours she said she wanted to be alone, so I went home, having heard the nurse say she would see the doctor and mental health team in a couple of hours. The next morning, she was still on the same ward, with no progress having been made. Finally a 'gatekeeper', as they are called, came to see her, and in my cousin's words, bullied her saying, You didn't want to die, did you. My cousin found this very distressing. Thankfully, a friend was visiting and told the staff my cousin didn't feel safe at home, so they agreed to keep her in, possibly transferring her to the psychiatric ward.\nEventually, my cousin saw an exceptionally kind mental health worker, who spent over an hour with her. This MH worker said she didn't think the psych ward would help her, but that she wouldn't let her be sent home without support, so my cousin agreed to go home. It was at this point she realised she should have been given support for her condition, but her doctor had failed to inform her of this or arrange for it to be put in place.\nShe is now back at home, again with no support, no medication (beyond the three days she was palmed off with), and still facing an 18-month wait for the assessment alone - never mind any treatment.\nI just feel so upset and disgusted that it was allowed to get to this stage. My cousin was not naturally suicidal, but ended up taking desperate measures to try and get the treatment she needed. Regardless of her intentions when she took that overdose, it could still have killed her. She should have had sufficient support way before that point.

I was holding them away from her but she managed to come into contact with them. At first I wasn't 100% sure whether she had actually touched them as there was no mark, but I ran her hand under a cold tap as a precaution. About an hour later I had a look and noticed that a mark was appearing. I gave her some ibuprofen in case it was sore, but as it wasn't there to begin with I didn't think it was serious but decided to keep an eye on it. After a while I noticed a tiny blister forming in the burn. I still kept an eye on it and when I could see the blister had grown a little I decided to call 111 as I was unsure about what to do. They advised to take her to hospital within the hour. I called my other half, her father, who said that he would leave work and take her, as I am a childminder and had children here so it would be easiest for him to take her. We didn't realise this would be an issue. \nWhile he was there they made him feel like we are suspected child abusers. We are nothing but loving parents who would do anything for our baby girl. They were accusingly questioning everything and stripped her down to check for signs of abuse. They told him that a health visitor would be coming to see me. I was worried sick about what was being said about me, and how this might damage my work. I called the health visitor in the morning in floods of tears as I could not believe what was happening all because of my daughter having an accident!   The health visitor assured me that I had nothing to worry about, that it had not been referred and that all they wanted to do was have a chat with me, which we were doing, so she said that is the end of I and nothing to worry about. I felt so relieved about this and felt so much better straight away. That lasted for 10 minutes as then I had a knock on the door and it was social services paying me a visit. they asked me lots of questions about what had happened. They were very patronising and I felt like I was being accused in the way questions were asked. Such as, why is her burn rounded if straighteners have straight edges?   I have no idea why the burn is that shape, but it is from touching the straighteners, so what are they suggesting? They told me that the hospital had referred it to them as a potential non accident!   What an absolute insult. I am disgusted that these things are being said about me and my daughter. I am nothing but a loving mother and am completely disgusted with how I have been made to feel over all of this. \nThis has completely knocked my confidence. I actually cannot believe that people think it is ok to make parents feel this way. I understand why it is being done, as there are children out there who are being abused. But does that mean that every single parent whose child has an accident is going to be treated this way? Children have accidents, it is unavoidable. Does this mean every single parent is a suspect? I have been made to feel completely incompetent, inadequate and like a suspected child abuser. This will never go away, I will always remember feeling like this and will always worry when we have to visit the hospital from now on. All I can see this behaviour doing is putting people off from taking their children to hospital. Do you think that child abusers would even bother to take them to hospital?I am completely insulted over this whole thing and I am so mad that I am being treated this way. \nI apologise for the long comment but you asked for my feedback and this is how I feel. Disgusted! ! Does this mean that anytime my daughter might have an accident then I am a suspected child abuser? I am a childminder, I could have lost my business over all of this, and I am completely innocent. I have done nothing but love and care for my daughter. So to be treated this way is completely disgusting.\nI'm sure they can find another way to look into children instead of completely destroying the parents confidence. I would like to thank you all personally for making me feel like this. I hope you are very happy about it.", "As an former NHS employee I am reluctant to complain, however the events of my dad's end of life care was so shocking that it has taken me 2 years to even speak about it. The most significant feeling is guilt, I let my dad down when he needed me most. \nMy father suffered a heart attack and a mini stroke, over the next few months we tried to care for him at home but with increasing dementia and a few serious falls, we put dad in the care of a local nursing home. No complaints at all for the wonderful care he received there. \nHowever, he suffered another stroke and was admitted to hospital. The stroke had robbed him of his speech but he still knew us, still responded by gestures. The doctor told us he would be unable to swallow and had pneumonia and told us he was be put on a End Of Life Care Plan and would probably only survive 2-3 days. \nBy the 5th day we questioned the diagnosis and dad was bright and alert, had no trouble swallowing, no breathing problems. The doctor then told us that actually he didn't have pneumonia. The doctors never came to consult with us, in fact, although we were by dad's bedside 24/7, even the nurses never spoke, they attended to his drip etc and never utter a word, either to us, or to dad. \nTo cut the story short - it took dad 14 days to die and I truly believe he was basically starved to death. We trusted that the medical team knew what was best but on hindsight, I firmly believe they didn't, they went down a route and we went along with it. \nI know I was in shock at the time and not thinking straight and I shall never forgive myself for not fighting for my dad.", "Dear Guilt,\r\nI have read and re-read your story, it is a sad and difficult read, and it must have been such a hard time for you all.

I know a lot of work has been ongoing to improve end-of-life care, so I sincerely hope that your experience is not the way it is now.\r\nI am sure you have nothing to reproach yourself for and I hope you can stop punishing yourself; we can't change the past but we can change the way we view it. At the time, you did what you felt was right and it may well have been exactly right but let us get you some answers, it may help you to move forward with less guilt\r\nI will pass your story on to the Manager's careful consideration, but please get in touch and let us look into this for you.\r\nIf you wish to let me know some details e.g. your father's name and date of birth, the team will be able to look into this further for you.

Whilst we are pleased that the review highlighted that Cornwall Park delivers the high standards of care that we expect of all of our services, we are concerned and disappointed to read the complaints made about Thorney Croft.\nIn response to this review, we have launched a full internal investigation, which will be led by impartial and experienced dementia care professionals, who will be rigorously assessing standards at the home. As Managing Director for Scotland, I will be personally contacting the family members who have raised these concerns, to understand more about their experiences and to ensure that we fully act upon their feedback. We have also contacted the Care Inspectorate to make them aware of these concerns, and will fully update them on our investigation.\nAs our investigation is ongoing, we are unable to provide a full overview of our findings and the improvements that we will be making to the home, at this time. However, we acknowledge that the experiences highlighted in this review fall short of our expectations for providing high quality care, and we will be doing everything possible to ensure that they are not repeated again.\nI would like to assure the public and the family members who posted this review of our commitment to taking robust and swift action to resolve any issues found as a result of this complaint and our own investigations.

First of all, please allow me to apologise on the Trust's behalf for the distress that both yourself and your cousin have experienced. As a Trust, we are fully committed to providing our service users and their families with a responsive, high quality and appropriate service. We believe there is nothing more vital for any care provider than to meet the needs of service users and to do that well. \nIt doesn't appear that this was your experience on this occasion, and I'm sorry that this was the case. Thank you also for your comment regarding the mental health worker. Kindness, compassion and dignity are of the upmost importance and its reassuring to hear at least partly that this was your experience.\nI have shared your comments with our Urgent Care Manager here at the Trust, Emma Hinchcliffe, and by way of an explanation Emma has set out what is likely to have happened in the case of your cousin, and in general for other patients who present at an accident and emergency department with similar issues. It is routine practice for medical wards and A&E departments to refer someone who has taken an overdose to mental health liaison services. \nThe mental health Liaison service would then complete a detailed health and social care assessment and collaboratively agree a plan with the patient and their relatives or carers where this was appropriate. Sometimes a decision is made that a person may need to be admitted for an for assessment. Depending on the outcome of this assessment the individual may be admitted onto an inpatient ward for further assessment and treatment. If however it was felt that the person would not benefit from an inpatient admission, then an alternative home based support plan may be offered instead, with some follow up from a home treatment team if this is felt to be appropriate.\nEmma has suggested that it may be helpful for you to contact her directly so that she is able to discuss this with you in some more detail, and importantly, to take on board any learning from your experiences so that we can improve the way in which we support service users and their families in crisis situations. \nTo make the necessary arrangements to speak to Emma I would be grateful if you could contact our Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS) who will be happy to set this up for you.

Mr A became unmanageable and agressive towards his wife who was really struggling to understand this disease.\nThe family requested emergency respite. During this respite it became clear just how difficult the situation at home must have been. We are a close family but we could not be there 24 hrs a day and obviously Mrs A was not telling us just how hard it had been.\nHis respite was in a local care home in Stranraer. It was a disaster from start to finish as they struggled to manage him and the family were often alerted by members of public that he was wandering in the street. Meeting after meeting it was agreed that he should go to Cornwall Park in Newton Stewart (25 miles away).\nThe care provided here was excellent and he was managed well!\nAfter some time it was evident that it was difficult for Mrs A to travel 25 miles on a regular basis and she felt she wanted him closer to home and so it was agreed that he would be transferred to Thornycroft in Stranraer.\nThe staff struggled to manage him from the start. We would get regular phone calls to assist with administering meds and showering etc. It felt like the family were the main carers in a care home. Due to staff being so poorly educated in dementia and approaches to aggression things quickly broke down.\nDuring visiting we heard staff say \"don't go in there there's sh*t everywhere\", we also noted that some residents were left sitting alone at the dining table for long periods of time, no one to prompt them to eat or drink. We understand that pay is low and staff are short but we did have grave concerns about the level of care.\nMr A was put under section (very sad for such a once proud big family man) and transferred to Cree ward at Midpark in Dumfries.\nHe remained in Midpark for roughly four months where his mobility deteriorated very rapidly. Within weeks he was off his feet and bed bound. It was clear he was in pain, whether the pain was neurological or from some underlying disease, we are unsure.\nHe was given pain relief & antipsychotics and by the end of his stay he had lost 5 stones.\nFamily were becoming very concerned that he may die 75 miles away from home and so requested a meeting to discuss transfer to appropriate EMI in Stranraer. It was agreed that he would be transferred to Darataigh (a local EMI intermediate unit with six beds) within a week to ten days.\nFour weeks later a family member received a voicemail to say he was being transferred back to Thornycroft.\nAs a family we were not happy with this decision being taken without discussion and indeed without the consultant (who was on A/L). We requested a further meeting to voice our continuing concerns.\nThe reasons given were that he was not \"settled\" enough to begin with but by this point he was \"beyond\" Darataigh! By this point it was agreed he end stage dementia and was now palliative.\nIt was agreed that he could be transferred back to The Galloway Community Hospital (Dalrymple ward) to be assessed and if he improved he may be moved to a nursing home 25 miles away.\nBy this stage, all the family wanted was for him to be pain free and to die locally with dignity. We hoped this meant he would be well looked after but how wrong we were.\nImmediately as I went in to visit the day he arrived, I was quizzed, \"where's he going? he can't stay here, we are a busy ward, this ward is for rehab\". Soon after, a nurse came to the ward rubbing her hands, \"good news! Cumloden have beds, we will get him away by Monday! \"\nCharming!\nSince then we have had comments such as \"there is no silver bullet for this\". He is in pain all the time. Charts are not filled in appropriately (one states he is orientated). Pity we missed this as family haven't seen him orientated for two years. We have had to request pain relief on a daily basis & that his fentanyl patch is changed as well overdue.\nWe requested that the palliative care team assess him. They carried out assessment and wrote Kardex up for meds and left recommendations. It took four days for this to be commenced after quite some pushing from family and further contact with Palliative but he is yet to receive any of the meds written up for sub cut.\nWe feel if Mr A was dying from cancer, the care and pain relief provided would not be questioned.\nThe lack of understanding in dementia is abysmal. Staff continue to ask \"Are you sore? Do you want a drink?\" and expect an answer. If he winces or is agitated or angry, give him pain relief! Offer him fluids as often as possible! (not the case).\nThe family are exasperated. We worry we are seen as complainers when all we are asking for is his basic care needs to be met. The dementia is no longer the issue. He is end of life and should be treated with respect and dignity and should be able to end his days in his home town. If our local NHS is refusing to provide this and making it as difficult as possible, what hope is there for improved dementia services in the future?\nWe have been told he will be staying where he is and the following day told (not directly) that he is only there until his pain is managed. But no evidence of completed Abbey Pain Scale used and it is very worrying that it is left to staff discretion as to whether or not he receives pain relief.\nCommunication has been disgraceful and all I can say is, as a local supporter of our local hospital I now understand the outcome of the recent inspection. Dementia Awards may look good in the local paper but practically our services are so disjointed and communication so poor, you couldn't follow through snow never mind making it a clear pathway for older, confused adults.", "We are posting the response below on behalf of the relevant service provider, Belmont Care Centre.\nIt is disturbing to read the poor experience endured by the family of both the health and social care sector.

Any response to this story will be forwarded to the individual concerned.\nMy father has recently been diagnosed with Dementia and after several instances of him hurting himself being considered a danger to himself, he was admitted to Cedars ward at Royal Oldham Hospital in October 2014.\nI had initial issues with communication as I was unable to find out which ward my father was on for a couple of days I was only given the main hospital switchboard number, I eventually found out through constantly ringing the switchboard number which ward he was on.\nI started visiting my dad every other day and initially was happy with the care my dad was receiving however over time and due to my father being under observation with regards to deputy ship order (which both myself and the council where going for) they started preventing him from being able to talk privately with me with he was finding this very frustrating.\nOn one occasion during his stay in hospital and whilst I was present, my dad lost his balance, he went to sit down but ended up falling back on bed and saying to me he had lost his vision I called for help and held his hand to reassure him that it was ok.\nThe nurse came to check him and took his blood pressure and after a few minutes his vision came back. The following day I visited my dad and afterwards I went to see senior staff who had seen to my dad during his episode the following day and a manager, I wanted to discuss what had happened and gave my opinion that it could be epilepsy as it ran in family, I was upset because the senior staff member denied it had happened.  I then asked for a list of medications which my father was taking, this took a couple of weeks for them to provide, and when they did give me medication list there was a drug on there which is used for dementia and epilepsy so I feel that the hospital did have an awareness that my father could have epilepsy however denied he had had a fit.\nMy father was in Cedars ward till end of May as we needed to find an appropriate care home for him. When I visited him in the evening, on a couple of occasions hospital staff said dad was being aggressive, I tried to explain that my dad had been a performer when he was younger and that he wasn't aggressive he was being expressive. On the occasions when they classed him as displaying aggressive behaviour, they would hold him down and administer by injection a drug to calm him down. \nWhen present I would always try and calm him down to stop it would not lead to him being held down and injected as he found it very distressing. Each time he had the injection for a couple of days after he could hardly speak, walk or keep his eyes open. On one occasion whilst he was in this state I came to visit it to find he had tomato soup all over his shoes. I was annoyed about this as whoever had helped him with his lunch had obviously not shown patience or care and had left the soup on his shoes, yet I feel there were enough staff on the ward.\nOn another occasion I was sat with my dad who seemed very worked up, saying they kept pressing him and doing tests on him, I explained they were doing capacity tests on him regarding the deputyship order as as I wanted to be honest with him. My dad just wanted to have a private conversation with me but the hospital staff wouldn't let him have any privacy which was upsetting him.\nOn my last visit to see my dad, my dad was talking to me with his door ajar, to try and give us some privacy. The Nurse then stormed in and pushed the door wide open smacking it against the wall, when she had gone my dad closed it to again leaving it a little open, the nurse came back and did the same thing, I lost my patience a little and said I have had enough of this and I shut the door myself. This time, the nurse opened the door and stood in door with her arms folded. I was feeling very annoyed at this and told them to go away and out of frustration called her a name. \nAt this point 3 security guards, 4 nurses and 3 doctors appeared but my father and I had already left the room as he still wanted to talk privately to me, and when they all approached us we were in the corridor. They surrounded us and my dad stood in front of me protectively. They tried to coax my dad over to them, and one nurse asked me to come to the office to speak to her, I said I would when everyone moved away as this was very intimidating and I felt bullied.  My dad then got emotional held my face and told me to deal with this properly / go through right channels. 3 security guards then grabbed me and dragged me off to another room.  I was allowed to leave the hospital under the condition that I made a statement the following day.\nI am very upset about the treatment of my dad as highlighted during his stay and by the treatment I received as I was only acting in the best interest of my dad.", "Thank you for taking the time to post on Patient Opinion.

Staff being spiteful to patients, bullying & blackmailing them. A patient had been asking staff to unlock the toilet door for half an hour & staff was sat in a chair in the lounge & seemed to be ignoring, this upset & aggitated the patient so to help himself to calm down he put his head phones on & started dancing, then another member of staff screeched at him to stop it or she won't let him go out for a cigarette. \nAnother patient was told to take his medication & drink from a cup that was already filled with water.

He was very upset but took the meds, yet she was stood by the sink & could easily have poured fresh water in the cup to put his mind at rest. \nI myself suffer from a number of health conditions and I was very ill mentally too, they did not give me my medication for 8 hrs in the 1st incident, then 10 & half hrs with the second, after that I recieved no meds for my pain, I was in agony & they wouldn't even let me have paracetamol. \nI couldn't go to the dining room due to my mental state which the staff was told about when I arrived & they was supposed to bring food up for me, but they didn't.

I wish to write this review as a reminder to myself and also to help anyone else. Mainly I hope somebody in management might review how things are done.\nI had pre-eclampsia so was admitted to hospital at 34 weeks. Before birth of the baby, things were good. I felt comfortable at the antenatal ward and all of the staff were lovely. The O&G consultant was excellent and so were the on-call O&G team and delivering midwife as I was induced early and needed emergency forceps delivery. I'm ever so grateful for this care in having my precious baby born safely at 34 weeks.\nUnfortunately everything became difficult after giving birth.\nA couple of hours after the birth, the baby was taken away from me for some sort of checking whilst my husband and family were still with me in the delivery suite. What happened next I gleaned more properly over the next few days as I asked different staff members for their recollections. Apparently the baby was left alone in the nursery room of the Transitional Care ward. It just so happened that one of the midwives was going into that room to do a BM on another baby and noticed that my baby was blue. The baby was revived with oxygen and paediatric registrar called and the baby then transferred to Neonatal Intensive Unit (NIU). If this was all that happened, I could somehow overlook this as unpredictable although I think the less-than-4-pound baby should not have been left alone so soon after birth without any monitoring device and I shudder to think what would have happened if he wasn't seen early enough.\nThings seemed ok for about 2 days whilst the baby was in NIU. But on the 2nd morning that I went to NIU I was told the baby was moving to Transitional Care ward in the afternoon. I wasn't told anything further and did not see any doctor either. I waited for my husband to arrive, and since we did not hear anything further, we went to NIU in the afternoon but the baby had ALREADY been transferred and was left all alone on the Transitional Care ward. We were really angry about this. How pathetic it was to then buzz the entrance door of the Transitional Care ward saying we thought our baby may be on the ward. The baby was left all alone by an empty bedside in Transitional Care ward, likely for one-to-two hours. We did complain (as in speak our grievances) to both Transitional Care and NIU staff in attendance, and it seems they both assumed the other would have communicated to postnatal ward where I was. \nMy baby at this point still weighing less than 4-pounds, on 2-hourly NG feeds, and jaundiced. If I had been allowed to speak to a doctor and have a say in the decision, I would have not wanted the baby moved to Transitional Care ward. For what it's worth, the environment in NIU is calm, quiet and peaceful, and there are enough staff members present to deal with the babies. In Transitional Care ward, the presumption is that your baby is a completely normal baby just needing to feed and grow and you are left to it. There is no need for any baby to be on a monitor on Transitional Care ward. And you should do everything for your baby irrespective of whether you are well or not and irrespective of how much care the baby needs.\nIt was incredibly difficult being on Transitional Care ward. The staff seemed to change every single day and each one seemed to have their own opinion on how the baby should be dealt with - whether lying on front or back, whether a heated mattress is needed or not, whether the baby's vomiting is significant or not. Whilst all of the staff are lovely, things just didn't seem to roll.\nMy blood pressure was becoming low and if felt so difficult being ordered around all the time. Because the baby moved to 3-hourly feeds and the nursing staff had a chart asking about nappy content, I had to ensure like clockwork that the baby's nappy was changed every 3 hours and I was even told by one midwife to write it down in the chart what I find. In the 24 hour period, I was told I could miss one nappy change in the night. Feeling as tired as I was and being in a ward with other mothers-and-babies and being disturbed most of the time by the constant interventions, even this felt very difficult. Yet I was told on 2 different nights by 2 different staff members to put on my mobile alarm clock to change the nappy in the middle of the night. It was so difficult to even sleep for an hour or two, that this order was not very welcome. Anyway I told them I won't put my alarm clock on as it will disturb the other mothers - I was told not to worry about it as the mother's are used to it. So much for empathy for newborn mothers then. Anyway I said I wasn't happy to do that. In which case they will come to wake you up to tell you to change the nappy. I was also expressing milk, which I then had to put in the fridge, and I was later told that I should measure out and heat the milk ready for the staff member to use for the NG feed. So basically do everything and let the staff members do the minimum they possibly can.\nIf you're well and at home with a newborn baby, life is difficult but you can appreciate the help of any partner or family member whilst being in your own home and not being disturbed all night by other newborn babies, and you can at least deal with the baby on-demand when it cries rather than on a 3-hourly clock on top of responding to on-demand cries and interventions throughout the night. When you're not well and the baby is constantly vomiting and you're spending an hour after each feed trying to settle the baby, you soon realise you're stuck in a nightmare.\nThings seemed surreal. My baby went for a feed at 2am in the night, and was then returned to me without his monitor. I was confused and angry. Apparently communication with mother about what will happen to your baby is not important. Another example of this was when both heel-prick blood tests the baby had done were clotted and I was only told after both attempts when they wanted my permission for a doctor to do a venous sample from his hand/arm. Well if you use heel-prick blood test with a good technique, it does not clot. Fortunately I knew this and so asked them to ask the doctor to do the heel-prick test rather than transitional care midwives who aren't well-practised in doing heel-prick tests for full blood counts for jaundiced babies. Again I was told I'm just being wrong and it will likely clot again because there is probably something wrong with my baby's blood. But no, the doctor did the heel-prick test and it didn't clot and the result was fine. \nAbout a week after being in Transitional Care ward, the baby was not taking to bottle feeding well and it was expected that I'm likely to stay in Transitional Care ward for a long time (at least another week - honestly a week felt like the longest time ever in that ward). The ward was filling up. Another couple moved into the bay next to me and there was just the curtain and a few inches separating my baby from their loud conversations and TV. I could see my baby was jolting from his sleep with the noise. Yet what can I possibly say to another new couple who are rightly happy and excited about their new baby. I had to move my baby's cot to my other side, by the window, despite knowing there was a draught somewhere from that window.\nI'm sorry but my baby was too small to have been moved to Transitional Care ward for a prolonged stay where no doctors would review the baby despite the baby doing large vomits after nearly every other feed (thus clothes and blankets needing to constantly be sent home to be washed as well).\nI may as well mention on here that the toilets in Transitional Care ward were dirty. There was blood. I expected it to be cleaned by at least the next working day, but, no, they were left like that. I actually would go to use Antenatal ward toilets which were better. And there is a sign on the Transitional Care staff door that says \u201cDo not disturb - handover in progress\u201d and it is permanently left on there, I suppose to daze any newcomers on the ward.\nI'm sorry my experience overall of Transitional Care ward was dreadful. I'm sorry because most of the staff members seem lovely, and some of them I really liked. But things just don't seem to work.\nIn the end I broke down in tears and had to discuss with the midwife how difficult I found the Transitional Care ward. It was agreed for me to be discharged and the baby to move back to NIU. The baby gained weight and went to bottle-feeding so much faster whilst in NIU. Since parents can visit NIU 24/7, my husband could actually see my baby more on that ward. Although it meant the baby wasn't by my bedside, I knew that the baby was on a monitor and being checked more thoroughly and would be reviewed by doctors. It was peaceful, warm and quiet for my baby.\nNot all the NIU nursing staff were happy and one NIU nursing staff member outright said to me that my baby was a bed-blocker. Some of the nursing staff in SJUH NIU just aren't as professional as I'd expect from a NIU ward. I wasn't happy to find in the NIU fridge three syringes of colostrum that I had left for my baby on days 1 and 2 which I had been told had been given to the baby but had just been left there, now a week out of date. That all said, I would happily pay private fees for my baby to be in a NIU or SCBU rather than Transitional Care ward. I did ask for my baby to be transferred to another SCBU if they weren't happy for my baby to be there.\nI'm sorry but unless you've actually been on SJUH Transitional Care ward with an underweight newborn baby, don't ask anyone else to stay there for a prolonged time. The ward seems to work for babies who just need BMs monitoring. But not for underweight sick babies.\n1 week in NIU and my baby improved so much faster, stopped vomiting, went onto bottle-feeding and was discharged.", "In  June this year, my mother got very ill with a chest infection and diarrhea. I rang 111 at about 11pm. My mother also suffered from copd as evidenced by an oxygen machine. By the time the doctor came at 1145pm, my mother had fallen asleep. The doctor very briefly examined my mother whist she was still asleep; at no point did he wake her up to ask her questions or properly diagnose her. He told me she had slight cracking on her shoulders but it was nothing much to worry about and he would get me some antibiotics and a drug to treat the diarrhea. He also said I did not need to give them to her until the morning with some food, some eight or nine hours away. I did precisely as he instructed. \nAround 2pm, my mother suddenly developed what I now know to have been a focal seizure/TIA. I range 999 immediately and the paramedics attended within four minutes. However, by the time they arrived my mother although obviously not well had recovered from the TIA. At no point during their visit did they ever mention the TIA. Nor did they mention, my mother should go to hospital for an assessment. Instead, they diagnosed my mother's chest infection and pronounced that it was only a slight chest infection and that my mother did not need to go to hospital as it was being treated by the antibiotics prescribed by the on call doctor. \nAs my mother seemed so ill and weak, I repeatedly asked the senior paramedic if my mum could be suffering from pneumonia. She replied that it was impossible for my mother to be suffering from pneumonia as her body temperature was only slightly raised and it would have to be a lot higher if my mother was suffering from pneumonia. As the senior paramedic then just advised me to give my mother some paracetamol to help reduce her slight temperature I never intervened when she suggested to my mother that she did not need to go to hospital and it was up to my mother if she still thought she should go. After all for some reason, perhaps shock I had forgot about her TIA and the senior paramedic had consistently told me my mother was ok and definitely not suffering from pneumonia. This reinforced the doctors diagnosis that my mother was only suffering from a minor chest infection. \nAnyway, the paramedics left. Two hours later my mother had another seizure, only this one was worse. I called 999, they came quickly and assessed my mother's medical situation as critical. She was blue lighted to the Norfolk and Norwich University hospital. She went to the resussication unit and then the acute medical unit. It was there I was told that she was suffering from severe pneumonia and was unlikely to survive. \nIf only the doctor had woke her to examine her fully she at least would have had a much better chance to survive. My mother began responding to the IV antibiotics in hospital but suffered a significant stroke sometime in the early hours at the beginning of July. The medical staff never treated her TIA's as they said she was so severely ill with pneumonia. She was diagnosed as suffering from a Glasgow level three coma and end of life treatment commenced. She passed away after such a brave and dignified fight at 330am a couple of days later. \nShe was a wonderful caring person in such contrast to the highly trained and experienced on call doctor and first senior paramedic attending my mother. In the four weeks since it first happened, I have only just realized why my mother was not admitted to hospital and it was because, in my opinion, some doctors and some paramedics feel the need to act as gate keepers to the local hospital, especially when it comes to the elderly. I am certain if my mother had been a lot younger, given her so obviously life threatening symptoms they would have admitted to hospital immediately. \nMy mother deserved so much more and if I could not protect my mother from their inactions what chance can other elderly patients have from such people. I have lost all trust in the East of England Ambulance service though I realize that many of their personnel are highly trained and caring professionals who always make the best clinical choices for all their patients, however old they are. It is just that when my mother most needed those kind of medical personnel, she so terribly unfortunately did not get them and her life chances were ended.", "My 86 year old mother spent 9 days in ward A22 in the Forth Valley Royal Hospital, there was a good atmosphere in the ward and, in general the staff were friendly, supportive and respectful towards her, and she was well cared for. \nShe was then moved to ward A32, what a difference! The domestic staff and student nurses were great but, (with the exception of one or two) the rest of the staff I saw with my mother were disrespectful towards here, rough and heavy handed when \"helping\" my mum and other patients in and out of bed and generally had an uncaring attitude. The consultant was patronising and insensitive when they spoke to my mum and upset her on more than one occasion. \nAfter 3 weeks in this ward my mum was sent home even though she had deteriorated so much that she could not even stand unaided. A week later she was in so much pain and discomfort the G. P. had her re-admitted. There was no bed for her so she spent from a Wed. evening until the early hours of Fri. morning in a cubicle in the Clinical Assesment Unit. \nShe was cold upset and in pain. They knew she had a heart condition, but they decided the pain in her side was indigestion. She was moved back into ward A32. When I got there on the Friday the other patients in the room told me that she had been very distressed and they had buzzed a few times for a nurse to help her but the nurses had ignored her. \nShe was by this time delirious and in visible pain, when I pointed this out to the Staff nurse she offered to get her some indigestion medicine! A few hours later my mother died suddenly, in agony of a heart attack, clutching my hand. It was horrendous for her and for me. It haunts me to think of the way my mother was treated the lasts days/weeks of her life. The lack of care and compassion in the C. A. U. and ward A32 was shocking.", "Dear EMP\r\nThank you for your posting and sharing your experiences of the care and the treatment that your mother recently received in Forth Valley Royal Hospital.\r\nMay I first offer you my sincere condolences on the loss of your mother, I can hear so clearly the deep sadness and concern your are feeling at what must be such a difficult time.

I was, and had been doing really well for the nurses for the full week, talking to the staff, choosing my meals each day and eating them all, talking to other patients (socialising), washing and dressing each day, taking all the medication they gave me and never refusing any, not a problem! !\nA day later, I found myself being taken to Aintree next door in a wheel chair one night, and only found out when I had been released (6 weeks later), that they had sectioned me. I was not told anything of this before-hand, and was not asked to sign a bit of paper to agree with their plans, which in my view is illegal. I have now found out that from my point of view all the information the nurses had given at the Walton Centre at the time was incorrect and false and therefore the Clinical Nurse who saw me on that night, was following incorrect information, and had had no need to send me to Aintree, never mind Section 11 me.  I was doing very well in myself.\n\nThe Clinical nurse did not check with me when I was talking to her, that the information she had been given was correct, (so she was following false allegations, very inconsiderate), nor should she have let my mum to come into the room at the same time, and invade my privacy, as I could not say how I had been, and what had just happened, with her present. She allowed my mum to rudely interrupt. As well as saying they were doing their duties to look after me, which they were not in my view., they had even let my mum sleep in my bed and invade my privacy, whilst she was ignoring me and pretending to be asleep. The nurses would not comply with me, which I found very rude and a form of blackmail.  How can they then have the cheek, to say it was me who was in the wrong? A form of sabotage.\nApparently I was not sectioned until 2 days or so after I got to Aintree, as that is not the reason they had sent me there.  Both hospitals were saying it was the other who had sectioned me. It also says in the notes that they did talk to me, and ask me to \"consider putting your hand up for a plea, but how could they when no one was even talking to me for 2 days at least. and following that nothing was said either. I'd known nothing about this, and as well as sectioning me, for what felt like no reason without telling me  (section 2), I asked them politely after 5 weeks can I go home soon, as I was getting fed up, and it felt like they took it out on me and sectioned me again a section 3. This has all been very cruel behaviour, from both the doctors and nurses. They had even given me injections when I was taking the medication 100% of the time.\nI feel I have been blackmailed and used and abused by the medical staff and am now stuck/addictedon/to the tables.  I am told I can not adopt can not train to be in the police, I feel my life has been turned upside down all due to the fact that the nurses and staff at the hospital in my view are not genuine.", "Around three years ago I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and have for some time not been at all happy with the inconsistent, untimely and generally very poor rheumatology service provided. This complaint relates to both the logistical and clinical care provided. The key points are outlined below:\r\n1. Many cancelled and rearranged appointments. This appears somewhat hypocritical given the noise the health service makes regarding missed appointments by patients. I get the impression that appointments are sent to patients without actually having a planned rheumatology outpatient surgery. This looks like an exercise in performance reporting adjustment.\r\n2. Patients seem to no longer actually see a consultant. I don't have a problem with nurse practitioners, indeed they are very good, but in most cases they still have to report back to a consultant who always takes far too long to feedback treatment advice and medication changes to GP surgeries. In the meantime patients suffer.\r\n3. Delays and cancellations simply lead to more appointments and pressure placed on the GP in the hope that a consultant can be prodded into dealing with serious RA issues. Again consultant's responses are untimely and patients continue to suffer.\r\n4. I have seen several different consultants, a different one at every appointment for quite some time. This has led to what is felt as an inconsistent treatment strategy. Indeed, at one point consultants had a difference of professional opinion over treatment. I was told an additional drug was going to be introduced and to have an eye test first. I duly did this and on my next meeting with a different consultant I was told, quite sniffily, that this wasn't going to happen because she didn't think it was needed. This was a waste of my time and money. Also at this point my medication was reduced.\r\n5. Within a few weeks of medication reduction I experienced a serious recurrence of my RA that has endured now for over a year! Methotrexate dose has been steadily increased with no effect until recently when I was told to stop taking it because of a liver problem. The only respite I've had over the last twelve months is a stream of intramuscular steroid injections every few months. Most of these injections I've had to request from a GP myself out of desperation to get relief from pain and immobility so I can continue to work for a living.\r\n6. At the moment I've just been put back on low dose methotrexate, a medication that has not worked for at least twelve months. A fact that the consultants seem to refuse to take on board. My last steroid injection has worn off and my RA is again at the point of painful immobility again. In the meantime there is silence from the consultants. I was to attend a nurse practitioner outpatient clinic this week but this has again been cancelled (twice now) and is not for another month (assuming this isn't cancelled too). This forces me to make yet another GP appointment to try and deal with current issues.\r\n7. Over the last twelve months I've gone from being absolutely fine to being forced to declare a disability at work and to start taking time off sick. It looks like I will have to take time off work again imminently when timely intervention may have avoided this.\r\nIn general terms I have been given the impression that rheumatology patients are an inconvenience to be dealt with by platitudes and one dimensional thinking rather than timely proactive involvement and coherent well planned care strategies. I feel the rheumatology service actually borders on patient neglect and at the very least provide an untimely and loose interpretation of NICE guidelines for the disease.\r\nPublicly available information indicates that there have been issues with rheumatology services on the islands for a very long time. For far too long the stock platitude response to complaints is recognition of the issue and an assurance that you are working on options to deliver a solution. It really is time that NHS Western Isles actually came up with a tangible and effective service for rheumatoid disease sufferers.", "We're very sorry to hear of your experience which you obviously found distressing.

Nor was there any medication leaflets on this amber drug given because again they had all been handed out that day. There was no signpost to reputable sites for me to look up my diagnosis. This resulted me taking to Google to understand a life long condition I have been diagnosed with. Whilst this is OK to do 'additional' research some primary information or at least professional websites could have been given, to save ambiguous and altogether non factual information found on the web which caused further stress and anxiety.\nIn accordance with the SIGN guidelines, it is recommended that the patient has bloods (LFTs, U&Es) done and a chest x-ray before starting MTX. The x-ray was not done despite my concerns voiced at the consultation of a SOB and chest pain.\nHaving felt some serious side effects over the weeks, I asked to see a member of rheumatology team on 3 occasions to discuss my condition and medication, and of which an additional written request was also made by the Occupational Therapy Dept on my behalf having heard my concerns. Unfortunately an appointment was not forthcoming then, nor has been. Over several months, with deterioration in my health, decreased well being and increased symptoms/pain I also asked the Department on 3 other occasions, to see a Consultant for an appointment (which was left as an 'open appointment'). I was told there were plenty of patients waiting before me and I would have to wait. I described my concern that the MTX was not working at week 10 and was told to give it the full 12 weeks and ring back. I went back to the GP who negotiated on my behalf to self inject MTX to save the side effects.\nHaving no accessible Rheumatology Service in the Western Isles and having messages from the patient, primary care and secondary care going through various admin, secretaries, via GPs and other secondary care services and AHPs) has led I believe to inconsistent communication, poor timely response and poor management plan of the medication and the disease. Ultimately this led to me becoming acutely unwell, resulting in a 999 call and emergency admission to WI hospital for over 7 days in April.\nHaving come off MTX which was finally agreed as not working as my inflammatory markers (whilst in hosp. the markers were elevated) and waiting for my LFT function to come back into a safe range (which they have never fully done), I have until recent weeks been in full flare since diagnosis Jan 2015.\nI was finally seen in July +6 months following initial appointment and agreed a new medication to start. I was further asked why I had not been started on a parallel medication which would 'combined' would better treat the disease, as my blood results in January 2015 indicated an additional inflammatory arthritis, along with my patient symptoms suggestive of Lupus. I am concerned that the results reporting in January were 'undigested' or 'not acted upon' and had they been reviewed, I may have avoided an patient in-stay and significant on-going ill health if treated appropriately.\nI have unfortunately had time off work, which I believe could have been avoidable, and now with further repeated tests which still is delaying effective management and treatment to date, I am concerned that this may impact me with a loss of earnings as per the organisations sickness policy.\nI appreciate the staff in the team are swamped with work, and are trying their best, but NHS staff and patients need support and the NHS as an organisation should address this and ensure the Rheumatology Service is clinically safe and effective.\nI appreciate the difficulties in delivering a service on a remote island with cost constraints, is exceptionally! difficult, and there are pressures on resources, budgets, staff time and the service all the time, with the additional complexities of SLAs, but I also believe that if the service cannot be delivered consistently and safely locally, then a clinical risk assessment should have been done and an alternative solution should have been sought to ensure patients receive the best and safest care possible.\nA positive note, having changed GPs, and registered with 'Group' the GP cohort at the Group MP in Stornoway have been brilliant in monitoring my health and managing my condition, above and beyond the role of Primary Care due to the lack of Rheumatology Service provided by the NHS WI.", "My son from an early age seemed very different from other children, he had no confidence to socialise and was sensitive and quiet withdrawn and depressed, often said he wanted to die, kill himself.. At school he had disruptive and emotional outbursts. Things became much worse as time went on, and I tried to cope, not understanding what I should do or how to handle things as he became more and more depressed. I eventually took him to a dr. when he broke down and said he wanted to drown himself he couldn't stop the voices. \n\nEventually he was sent for an assessment at 13 years old, by which time our family was under immense strain and stress. He was diagnosed with ADHD and  OCD he tried the medication, but had become too set in his ways and refused the medication. School failed, he left with out an education and slipped into the path of the police, drinking ect....from this into prison and failed marriages and relationships followed. Unable to hold a job, organise his life or keep on top of finances he remains needy and my husband and I are broken. Anti-depressants, and counselling have not helped over the years and no amount of knocking on doors has helped him. \n\nHis current case worker is in our view failing him, fobbing him off despite knowing for two months he was being made homeless- she has not supported him at all in finding help.

Due to my fathers bad eye sight, he phoned me about 6am, as he struggled to get her up. My father is in his 80's and waiting on a pacemaker to be fitted. I phoned NHS24, who took all the information, I was informed that I would be contacted by the out of hours doctor, which I was.\nThe Doctor which I cant remember his name decided not to come out and would send District nurse, as this was now around 7. 30am. 2x Night nurses arrived about 7. 50am, took a look at my mothers leg and said, that the skin flap should have been put back over her leg within an hour of the injury had happened. I asked if they could try, to which I was told by the District nurse in a raised voice, that she worked in the vhk and it is within an hour. She did put saline water over the wound but did not dress it. She phoned back the Doctor, who again did not come out and an ambulance was called.\nThe nurses left and left the wound undressed, the ambulance arrived in the 2 hours we were given. I could not fault the Ambulance crew who attended, they were very professional. It was the Ambulance crew who soaked Bandages in saline water and dressed the wound, which they were very surprised it was left without any dressing. \nWhen we arrived at A and E we were well looked after. We were informed that my mother had a Chest infection which was causing her to have Delirium. The nurses attended to her leg and were a little disguste das to why the nurses did not try and put the skin back. I informed them as to what I was told by the district nurse, to them replying it would have helped but any time would have been ok. A and E did a fantastic job, my mother was then sent to admissions one, she was admitted after 30 minutes, due to her Delirium she started to pull out her cannula. I went out to look for staff but could not find anyone, a doctor was passing and helped she rang the bell but no one came she asked if I could go and find someone. There was not a lot of staff about but did find a member of staff standing talking to the domestic about every day life, she did come once I interrupted the conversation. \nWe were introduced to a doctor who was very good, but needed to attend a meeting but would be back within 15 minutes. We sat around for 30 minutes but the doctor did not return, by this time I needed to deal with my father who had been in the hospital since 10am and had not eaten or drank. We left my mother at around 5pm and came back the next day to be told she had been moved to ward 15, by the receptionist in ward 15. We had not received any phone call about her move.\nWhen we reach ward 15, my mum was sitting at her bedside bewildered as to what was going on. No member of staff asked myself or my father about my mums likes and dislikes or her habits. We rarely saw a member of staff. When I spoke to staff I was informed that they were busy and short staffed, I asked to speak to her doctor, but was told I couldn't make an appointment and to phone around 10am, which I tried several times for the phone to ring for around 20 minutes with no answer. I felt I was pushed from pillar to post.\nI noticed my mother was walking with a zimmer and a member of staff to the toilet, I asked if she had been assessed for the zimmer, to which they replied they were just using it. Once in the toilet, she was left alone.  The support worker went to the desk to use her personal phone. I thought there must be another member of staff in the toilet with her, but there was no one as I heard my mother screaming as she fell trying to use equipment that she was not assessed for. She complained of a sore inner groin, she was sent for an xray. After that incident I noticed she was on incontinence pads, which she was not on before she was admitted to the hospital.\nThere was one evening there was only 2 members of staff on the ward as several bedside bells were going off no one attended to them, I went in search of staff as these elderly ladies were getting anxious to be told by staff they are short staffed. Very scary as this is a 24 bedded ward.\nMy mother was put into a side room due to her having Diarrhoea. When I went in to the side room she was sitting naked on the chair with the hospital gown wrapped around the arm of the chair, and with her having delarium she did not know what she was doing. On other visit I had to ask staff if they could change her pad, as I had been there for over 2 hours and no one came and saw how she was, her skin was badly breaking down, through out her time in ward 15 she was never showered.\nI felt the staff did not know how to speak or interact with the elderly patients who could not do for themself. I got the impression they were a burden to the staff. My mother had several scans and xrays done whilst in the VHK but I have had no results, they insisted on telling my mother who cant recall any of the conversation. \nI am pleased my mother has been moved on, she is now in Glenrothes Hospital, sadly due to ward 15 not keeping up with her personal hygiene, she has a catheter in situ, due to the blisters and burns caused by her incontinence pads. Glenrothes Hospital attends to all her needs and there is a marked improvement on her skin, and her mental health. Staff between WARD 15 at VHK and Glenrothes Hospital is like night and day. I felt so sorry for my mother as she has enough pain due to her lung cancer without all this as well.", "Dear angry relative\nThank you for taking the time to share what has clearly been an awful experience for your mother and the entire family.

She was there for two years. She was in the nursing wing because her main health problems involved a degree of heart failure and a degree of kidney failure. With adequate care these conditions were stable, and she enjoyed interaction with friends and relatives, discussing a range of subjects and exchanging stories and memories with ease. I had full Power of Attorney during those two years.\nMy mother died in the Midlothian Community Hospital in June 2014, where she had been transferred after emergency treatment at ERI for dehydration and infection. Please note that this emergency admission had been initiated by me.\nDuring my mother's 2-year stay in Aaron House, basic failures in care led to her having to receive hospital treatment for dehydration. This happened three times. I complained to the Care Inspectorate on two of those occasions (January 2013 and April 2014) and both times the Inspectorate upheld that adequate fluid and nutrition had not been provided. During my regular visits (a minimum of four visits per week) to see my mother in Aaron House I often noticed examples of substandard care.\nI am placing certain key aspects of this story on the Patient Opinion website because the whole experience of monitoring my mother's care has demonstrated to me several very serious failings in a system which purports to provide adequate care to elderly vulnerable people.\nCare Inspectorate\nHaving determined in January 2013 that my mother had indeed been deprived of adequate fluids and nutrition, the Inspectorate placed certain requirements on the functioning of the care home. However, I believe the Care Inspectorate failed to ensure that these requirements were being carried out, and the care home continued with its faulty practices, leaving my mother seriously dehydrated on two further occasions.\nSocial Work Department\nAaron House is one of a number of care homes used by Midlothian Council, and my mother's care there was funded largely by the Council. However, as far as I was aware, the Council's Social Work Department did not involve itself in checking the competence of the day-to-day care provided by Aaron House. Certainly my mother did not have the required reviews of her care.\nGP practice\nIt is my understanding that the local GP practice made regular visits to Aaron House as well as at times being called out to patients, and that this had been the case for a number of years. I am alarmed and horrified that the GP practice apparently did not notice the deficits in care such as inadequate provision of fluids and nutrition, and did not implement vigilance even when complaints were upheld by the Care Inspectorate.\nAt the end of March 2014, I believe my mother would have died of lack of care in Aaron House had I not insisted that she was moved to the ERI by ambulance. At first Care Home staff had told me that my mother \u2018did not meet the criteria' for triggering GP attendance, and when a GP did eventually attend, she seemed unwilling to move my mother to hospital and I had to press her to do so. Soon after my mother arrived at the ERI, I took photographs of her in her dehydrated collapsed state. What these photographs have recorded is very shocking indeed. Not only was my mother barely conscious, but also the contents of her urine bag appeared to be largely pus.\nERI triage immediately began to rehydrate my mother, and her condition quickly improved.\nERI triage\nIn this busy department, my mother received appropriate medical care, delivered with compassion. During my discussions with staff, I was shocked to learn that it was not uncommon for a resident of a care home to be brought in by ambulance for emergency rehydration. I wonder how that could be.  Surely it is a central function of each care home to ensure that its residents receive adequate fluid and I wonder why should failings in care homes be allowed to continue \u2013 resulting in extra work being piled on to a busy hospital department.  I asked if figures were kept of how many dehydrated residents of care homes were brought in, and was told that no one kept such records.\n* * * * *\nI think there is a massive and entirely unacceptable difference between dying of lack of care and dying while being cared for.\n* * * * *\nI believe that that vulnerable people \u2013 even those of full cognitive capacity \u2013 can find it impossible to insist on receiving adequate care, and that \u2018surveys' of \u2018patient or resident satisfaction' can give \u2018results' that are skewed by the fact that patients do not feel safe to express their actual views and experiences.", "Our priority is to ensure the health and welfare of the people we support. We take all feedback from the Care Inspectorate and from the relatives of the people we support extremely seriously. The Care Inspectorate's outcomes in relation to this matter were published in July 2014, and we acted on their feedback immediately.  \r\n  \r\nIn the intervening year the home has continued to improve in all areas. We were pleased to receive positive feedback from the Care Inspectorate in our March 2015 inspection and we continue to work hard to ensure we provide good quality care and support.", "Following a minor operation I had in summer 2015 I would like to make you aware of my situation.\nThe operation was for a hemorrhoidectomy and skin tag removal which took place at Mexborough Montague hospital.\nI was told there might be some minor bleeding and discomfort following the operation but I should be fully recovered by four weeks.\nThe Mexborough hospital discharged me in the afternoon, following an operation in the morning, with some co-codamol tablets and some antibiotics to help prevent infection along with some Lactulose. I was told to rest for the remainder of the day and keep the wounds clean after every bowel movement.\nOver the next three days I was in horrendous pain and bleeding profusely which was very worrying as there was a lot of blood and clotting therefore my family took me to A & E. The first two doctors I saw said I needed to go back to surgery and prepared me by putting a cannula in my arm and taking some bloods etc. After waiting for over an hour a consultant came to see me and decided I was ok to go home (How he knew this I don't know as he did not examine my bowel! ) but he gave me some pads etc. to use and told me to keep everything clean.\nAfter a few days I began to struggle to pass urine and went back to A & E (as it was a Sunday) where they prescribed me some antibiotics to treat a water infection, they also prescribed me with some cream to help ease the pain around by bottom.\nIn the next few days I went back to my doctor as the tablets had given me thrush so he prescribed me with something to get rid of that as well as some liquid morphine to help me with the pain as the co-codamol were not really helping. I had still not properly been to the toilet so I was given some sachets to take with water to loosen the poo and help me to go. By this point I was not sleeping properly and was exhausted and very upset that there had been no real improvement.\nThe thrush had still not gone later that month and I was not really any better which made me very concerned. I went back to my GP and she said that I should be much better by now as it had been 19 days since the operation. She arranged for me to see my consultant on soon afterwards to get some answers. The consultant saw me and said I just needed more time to heal and that the operation sometimes took people longer to recover. I was not really satisfied with this as I was sure there was something wrong but he let me go home again even though I was not properly examined.\nThe following week I saw my GP again as I was in agony, who rang DRI as she thought I was impacted and needed help.\nI was admitted to hospital in early august and I have had to have an emergency operation to remove a blockage in my bowel and I am now in recovery. If the notes I had been given had been clearer when I originally left the hospital I might not have suffered the way I have. They stipulated not to sit on the toilet for longer than three minutes at a time and not to strain! Obviously I followed these instructions and ended up back in hospital.\nI realise that not everybody is the same and sometimes there can be complications following procedures but I don't feel I was given enough information following the operation. I think it would be beneficial for future patients to be given a list of things that might go wrong and if they do what they can do/ have to help them. The Doctor in the A & E department told me that in the past patients would have been in hospital for two weeks following this operation but as time has gone on people are now discharged the same day. I was also told it can be common to have heavy bleeding following the procedure and quite painful! ... why was this not conveyed at the time of discharge?\nIt has been very worrying for me and my family and it is very difficult to get hold of people for advice and appointments to receive the correct medication to help with the symptoms. If I had been made aware of potential issues upon leaving the hospital I could have been better prepared and maybe dealt with the situation in a different way.\nIt has been a very traumatic experience and I would hate for anyone else to have to go through what I have.", "Hi Paris362 - Thank you for feedback following your recent surgery at Montagu Hospital.

I felt that the people providing care broke trust with many patients. Keeping the patients happy felt very secondary to themselves,\nI felt very much like all care staff were waiting to tick out, and would openly express how they couldn't wait to go home, the day space was very small, but it was apparent that most professionals would avoid your looks, and avoid you in their stride. Most would congregate in the small office space, sometimes the door was shut, leaving patients feeling abandoned. Sometimes you didn't know that staff were in until you saw them leave. The day room was filled with colour in pages such as winnie the pooh, basic flowers, and varicose cartoon characters and unicorns, and ironically frustration. I felt this was patronising, and insulting at best.\nI arrived in the evening and was later given my \u2018night time medication' I knew that my tablets were blue at night not white, but trusted that they knew what they were doing, it became clear they had mixed the two around. Sertraline is quite a commonly used and prescribed antidepressant, and was what I was started off when working with the crisis team before admission who had given the hospital a fair amount of notes about my referral and difficulties, and medicinal information. the notes highlighted my difficulties in regards to being ignored and unheard, and unimportant, (but I believe all patients are just as vulnerable if not more) and this medicine was given to me at night by a nurse (only a nurse can give medication to a patient as opposed to a health care assistant) any basic print out of this medicine will clearly instruct to take in the morning, never at night. \n\nI was shocked as it is so commonly known, and she should be familiar with the antidepressant. Although I made this clear, and how swapping it around made me feel uneasy, I was ignored, and my input on the matter felt completely dismissed. And they continued to do this for the duration of my time I was there,\nI don't menstruate, so never really looked into the sanitary bin, but a week in to my stay, there was a smell, and insects, and it was full to the brim, and god knows how long it had been there, one woman couldn't possibly have filled this bin? I asked somebody to promptly move it, as the smell was getting worse, I was assured the problem was resolved, only to find they had swapped the bin with another equally filled bin, and on a few occasion there were ants in the bed.\n\nThere was blood and snot from the last patient on the wall, at the top of bed, were the pillow lay, which was distressing enough, as well as being denied my proper medication, but in addition a man at the door of my room, sat eating  just staring in, and from time to time reading his book.  Countless times being refused any sleeping medication ( which I took in the community anyway ), I was allowed to pace and struggle till hours as late as 5am,\n\nBut nobody had read my notes, and didn't realise that trying to sleep, with a man waiting for me to do so, would only create more trauma,\nWhen you are admitted, you have your blood taken, I had mine taken three times because they had forgotten to test the first 2, and left it sitting over in the lab for 5 days, and the first two were untestable for this reason. I didn't have ward round, for 2 weeks, although, it is compulsory to have a basic care plan within 48 hours, (I was admitted on a Friday night, and on Tuesday I had still herd nothing)\n\nfor me there was no plan, no structure was put in place, and nobody knew anything about me, and I found this difficult enough outside of hospital, and I took it very personally, every time I was promised a review, a different doctor would take me on, and I never met the first two, or I was told I was forgotten. I was frustrated, and nobody even told me if this had happened, so id usually be left waiting until id ask.\n\nDue to no review, I was on high observation longer than a week, although I was being monitored quite highly, I was still watched squirming by members of staff as large, intimidating gentlemen, would sit next to me, as I ate my lunch in the canteen, I was told that I wasn't allowed my dinner on the wards. And they would still watch me squirm. Again, not doing something as basic as reading notes, I'm sure from as little as I've said you can imagine what my issue is. Even if you can't, you're not being paid to do so, so that's okay.\n\nThere was no activities board, and no knitting group, despite what they tell you. There was a crafts group on Mondays, where all patients were offered the chance to make crafts, the theme was \u2018mad hatters tea party', we were not allowed to keep these crafts, and they would be decorations for the staff ball. The theme alone feels laughable, due to the circumstances, but was also free labour to decorate a \u2018Mad hatters' themed dance, to celebrate their hard work? it just seemed like another kick in the teeth.\n\nMy mum did kick up a fuss when I had explained all of this, I'm lucky that I have someone assertive enough to stand my corner, and know the ins and out of a psychiatric back ground. Who was able to spot all of the wrong, confirm that the level of care was poor, and not be embarrassed to say so, because it wasn't all in my head?\n\nI felt bad watching those who didn't have that support, who didn't really have visitors, or even those who did, but couldn't fight back, or were not assertive enough. In that sense I'm lucky,\n\nWith it being a mixed wards, there were different levels of care and intensive care that had to be met, and I felt like I was being overlooked, god knows how long other patients have felt this way, can they get better here? Has it made them worse? That is what haunts me. The others had it worse, I grew close to some of the female patients,\n\nI watched a very vulnerable female patient restrained and forcibly medicated.  \nI believe there could have been other ways to resolve this. And if they knew anything about her, they would realise that by even suggesting that, as a form of action to take is so inappropriate.  \n\nThere was another elderly woman, who had difficulty dressing herself, and being mobile.  She had a few problems and I think this would have been helped by staff talking to her and spending more time with her.\n\nOn another occasion I heard a nurse talk about the personal details of a patient that had come in, due to lack of care about confidentiality. \n\nThis was a temporary stay for me I urged to be moved closer to home, as there is a massive shortage of beds in the country, I really had to push, and this is where I stayed until I was transferred to a hospital in my area. Were the care was amazing, and I learnt that people in the health care system, are not all so cold, and will take every moment of their shift to be with you. You were properly cared for, Nurses and HCA got to know what made you tick, and learnt who you were, and could tell if you were okay or not because of a bond that was made. I spoke to a lady there about my experience. She knew Lucy Wade, and she also agreed that it has brought shame to her name  and shared concerns about the care there.\n\nI'm writing this because I feel it's important to protect vulnerable people. I'm not doing it to shame the hospital.  I am urging anyone to just be more aware of this sector of the care system, it's often overlooked.\nI've been told that it is compulsory for the hospital reply, so I await in anticipation.", "Dear Etiak,  \r\nI would like to thank you for your posting and highlighting your experience on Lucy Wade Ward.  \r\nFirstly I would like to apologise on the behalf of Adult Mental Health for the dreadful experience you have encountered and would like to assure you that I, as the General Manager, am taking this extremely seriously.

I anticipated a pleasant stay at the hospital and I hoped that a good experience would speed my recovery and enable me to return home quickly.\n\nMy operation took place in the afternoon and the Neurosurgeon and his team, the anaesthesiologists and nurses who prepared me just prior to going into Theatre and who took care of me up to that point, were wonderful.\nHowever, after my operation was over and as I was being taken out of Theatre 11 into the Recovery Ward, I was attended by a nurse. They walked alongside my bed as it was being wheeled into the Recovery Ward and I was in tremendous pain. I was crying out for pain relief, moaning and groaning. \n\nThe nurse put their hand on me and she said very loudly and in a mocking tone, Alright dear, calm down. You are not in labour. The nurse said this in front of approximately six other ward staff. I couldn't quite believe what I had heard and challenged the nurse by saying that as a matter of fact I had given birth and was well aware of the pain felt during labour.\n\nI raised my voice and asked how they dare speak to me like that. The nurse responded by trying to make me shut up. They kept saying Shhhhhh, Shhhhhh. Quiet now. Shhhhhh. I asked again how dare the nurse speak to me like that, weren't they aware that people process/feel pain in different ways and that just because I had been under a general anaesthetic, it didn't mean that I was deaf or unaware. I informed the nurse that they were being rude and inappropriate and that I had heard every word they had said. I was not impressed and I told the nurse not to touch me again and that I thought they should receive further training in how to comfort patients, how to feel empathy and how to manage pain relief competently.\n\nI found the nurse extremely patronising. I continued to request pain relief and eventually my surgeon appeared and asked me how I was. I told the surgeon what had happened and the barefaced nurse stood in front of me and said they did not say that at all. I  must be mistaken. They did not say that. They would never say something like that. In any event, I suddenly received my pain medication and the nurse disappeared. The nurse could have gone off shift or they could have been removed. I really do not know what happened to the nurse and I couldn't have cared less. I was observed for a little while and then moved onto the RHLWard 3D, Neurosurgery.\n\nUnfortunately, this was the first of a number of atrocious incidents which I still cannot believe I was subjected to. I say subjected to because all of the trauma I suffered following this initial awful behaviour seems to have been directed solely at me I feel.\n\nI arrived on the ward and after two or three hours I was in severe pain again and asked for pain relief. I was once again left in agony for hours without adequate pain management, to the point where I was in tears asking for someone to help me. The HCA's would hear me calling for help but would only respond if I pressed my buzzer. I would ask for pain relief and the standard response became that they would let the nurse in charge know but I would see neither the nurse in charge nor the HCA again for long periods of time. When I did see a nurse I would ask again and would be told that the key to the drug cabinet could not be found or that they were busy. Most of the night on that day August into the early hours of the next morning, I was left writhing and shaking with the pain. I cried for the first time this day.\n\nIn the early hours of the next day, I was given morphine but as I was deep in pain by that time, the relief was slow\n\nActivity was frenzied that night, with people rushing back and forth. I hadn't slept at all from 6. 30am on one day and still had not slept by the early hours of the morning on the next day in August because of my pain relief mismanagement by the nursing staff and then as a consequence of the lady opposite being unwell. After things calmed down a little, I asked a HCA for help. The HCA looked over her shoulder at me and just walked away without responding.\n\nMy medical notes were left on my bed and I decided to take a look. It was documented that I slept between 1. 00am and 4. 00am, during the period which straddled this lady being unwell! I questioned this discrepancy with the nurse in charge as I had not slept the whole night and had witnessed everything. I told the nurse that there were mistakes and I wanted them changed. The nurse seemed unconcerned and matter of fact. Because of this, I looked through my notes and made the necessary changes to reflect facts, the things that had actually happened and which had not been fabricated by staff on the fly.\n\nLater on the same night, as I couldn't walk to the bathroom, I requested a bed pan but as I wasn't helped, I couldn't get onto it. So I asked for a commode instead. Once again, the HCA who brought it to me just stood there watching me. So I sent them away and tried to help myself. I did manage to get onto the commode although it took me a long time to manage. It took me some time to clean up with antibacterial wet wipes I had brought into hospital with me, change my underwear and nightgown and get myself back into bed. I could not cover the commode as I wasn't given a cover for it. I had just struggled to get back into bed when my closed curtain was flung back and two porters strode through my sleeping area to collect a patient for a CT scan. I wasn't warned they were coming onto the ward nor was I asked if I was decent \u2013 nothing! When I complained that this was wrong, it was insinuated that the patient they had come to collect was more important than I was and needed more urgent care and attention than me and that I should be ashamed to complain.\n\nLater the same day on Saturday afternoon, my daughter came to see me and she brought my grandson with her. I was unaware that children were not allowed onto the ward as no one had told me. When she arrived, I was summoned from my bed and unceremoniously placed onto a commode and wheeled out into the open public reception area to visit with my daughter and grandson. I was just glad to see a friendly face and my grandson did me the world of good. However, at the end of the visit, my daughter pushed the buzzer and asked staff at the reception if someone could please take me back to the ward. The person she spoke to should not be on front office duty as they were rude, unpleasant and nasty and kept asking who it was that my daughter wanted taking back to the ward. My daughter tried to explain who I was and whilst all this was happening, I was left in reception on the commode waiting to be let back onto the ward.\n\nEventually a lovely HCA kindly came and wheeled me back in. As I was being wheeled back past reception someone at reception shouted across the desk in front of a number of other staff who were standing there that I should not complain as my well being and timely discharge from the ward depended upon the flick of their pen. They all laughed. It seemed I had become the centre of their entertainment. After my daughter left, I could hear the undignified and unprofessional sound of staff who should know better, gossiping, hooting and hollering in the ward office. Despite the door being closed, they could be heard across the whole ward. Far from showing empathy they began insulting me, describing me as that woman and who, her, shouting about the fact that my daughter had dared to point out to them that they had been rude and talking about my grandson and laughing. To reinforce this, I heard someone questioning whether or not my grandson was my daughter's child or mine. They concluded that I was probably not his mother as I was too old!\n\nThe same night, I tried to bring to the attention of an HCA that the lady opposite appeared to be lapsing into unconsciousness again. I had been calling out to her and she appeared to be in an unresponsive state. Instead of immediate action being taken, I was told very aggressively that I should leave her and them alone so they could get on with their jobs. I was shocked and fell silent after advising them that I would be filing a formal complaint. After the HCA and the nurse in charge had seen to the lady, the nurse came back to my bedside and gave me a full apology, explaining that they had been aggressive and rude and that they apologised. I accepted the apology but said that I would be making a complaint nonetheless.\n\nLater that night and once again, after reassurances from doctors that I would not be left without adequate and timely pain relief, I was left in pain and ignored by nurses for 30 minutes. I have to emphasize that I in no way blame the doctors for these failings.\n\nAfter having my wound dressed and covered with a \u2018waterproof' dressing, I had a shower on Saturday. However, on Sunday my dressing had lifted a little. I brought this to the attention of the nurse in charge. By the time the nurse  came to take a look, the dressing was completely off and my drain was hanging on without support. Instead of changing the dressing for a clean one, the nurse put another one on top of the old dressing and advised me to bring it to the attention of my doctor when they made the rounds later on that day.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning, I pressed my buzzer and requested pain relief. I was made to wait 39 minutes (until 2. 36 am). It was eventually explained to me that my medication could not be dispensed as apparently no one was available to do it as they were all checking the CD cupboard at the same time. However, I actually heard a number of night staff having a lovely time, laughing and giggling whilst I sat waiting once again in severe pain.\n\nI decided to make a comparison so that it could be seen for what it actually was;\n\n1.\tThe lady opposite me requested pain relief and received it in 10 minutes\n\n2.\tA new lady who had been admitted earlier on in the day asked for attention to adjust her drain. They also asked for a piece of toast. She received her toast and her drain had been adjusted in 10 minutes\n\n3. A lady on the far side of the ward requested assistance with her arm sling and received it within 10 minutes\n\nAt one point I lost my temper and asked a staff nurse why I was not having my observations monitored even though all of the other patients on the ward were receiving regular obs. and why once again I was being made to wait for pain relief instead of receiving it at regular and timely intervals or as and when requested. I pointed out that unless I requested that my observations be taken or unless I asked for pain relief (during the day after speaking to the doctor during rounds), I did not receive any help although everyone else did. This was the case intermittently during the day but was particularly awful at night. People seemed to become deaf at night even if I used the buzzer, which I became reluctant to do as it disturbed the other ladies. The nurse in charge explained that my observations were being taken six hourly and that pain relief would be given if I requested it. This was absolutely not true. I cried for the second time this day.\n\nThe next day at 4. 10am, I requested pain relief as I had only been given half of my previously requested dose. Unfortunately, my file mysteriously \u2018went missing'. This appears to be a stance adopted when the staff require an excuse not to dispense medication or when they wish to change notes on a file. This was done to me and to another woman on the ward I know of. My file was finally found, my dose discussed and I finally received a full dose nearly three hours following my initial request for pain relief. Following early morning handover, I was ignored for pain relief and completely overlooked by the nurse in charge. I asked to speak to the nurse but they never came.\nOther incidents;\n\n\u00b7 I was left with oxygen tubes in my nose despite the fact that it should have been removed by nursing staff following my surgery in the morning. The tube was finally removed in the afternoon two days later, following ward rounds when the doctor asked me why I was still using oxygen!\n\n\u00b7 Male and female visitors used the patient toilet\n\n\u00b7 Visitors ate patient's food\n\n\u00b7 On several occasions, the keys to the drugs cabinet could not be located especially when I needed my pain medication\n\n\u00b7 Patients' visitors wandered around freely whilst patients received treatment or when eating evening meals.\n\n\u00b7 On a particular day, the nurse in charge was concerned with my heart as it was racing. The nurse did an ECG as I had been tachycardia for a couple of days (I think it ran at a maximum of 127). They later brought it to the attention of the doctor during ward rounds and the doctor put it down to inadequate pain management as opposed to an irregularity with my heart!\n\n\u00b7 My surgical stockings were removed and not replaced despite the doctor instructing nurses to do this.\n\n\u00b7 My doctor administered anticoagulant during ward round and instructions were left that no more be administered. Despite this, on three further occasion's nurses tried to administer it again. I had to refuse to have it administered and referred them back to my doctor.\n\nIn conclusion, I can only conclude that this behaviour was in retaliation for my complaint against the nurse. I do not and have never met any of the people who treated me in such a way and I have no personal connection to any of them. I was never abrupt or rude to any of them and I was always taught to say please and thank you, which I did. My only complaint at that point had been against the nurse who had been rude following my surgery.\n\nDespite these unprofessional, potentially harmful and puerile actions, the majority of the caring staff that I came into contact with during the day may have had issue with me and knew about my complaint against this nurse but they were professional. They may not have agreed with my complaint about the nurse but they nonetheless behaved with cool professionalism. They did not respond in an impersonal and uncaring way. However, there were those who I assume had heard about my complaint and who, I believe, took it upon themselves to behave unprofessionally and to show me how people are treated when they complain. Staff who were not involved with this whole situation suddenly became involved. It became very much like a school playground, with staff passing by to stare at me without saying a word but just glaring.\n\nAs a result of this behaviour, I pushed myself to become mobile as quickly as possible. I was determined that I be allowed to go home. The evening following surgery, I walked every day as much as I could and did as much for myself as I could especially washing myself and visiting the toilet. The other ladies on the ward told me I was doing too much but I didn't care, as I just wanted to go home. So early on the morning a few days later, my doctor finally discharged me during ward rounds. I was being discharged I believe in a deliberately slow way. I didn't leave the ward until approximately 7. 00pm that evening.\n\nA porter came to wheel me down to the discharge waiting area and my daughter helped to walk me to the car which was 200 yards away. I can honestly say that I have never been happier than I was that evening to be leaving that ward.", "My friend attended the A&E at Royal Derby Hospital as she suddenly started to vomit and her heart started to beat really fast. Also before this episode she had a light pain in her right kidney which only got worse and worse especially when she started to vomit. \nAt A&E the doctor made a blood test and an urine test and the results clearly showed an infection. She was given antibiotics Co-amoxiclav through her vein and then later discharged with antibiotics for 7 days. She made the doctor aware that she had gastritis which was serious in the past and that she was not allowed to take antibiotics for a long period. \nAfter a few days of treatment, the pain in her right kidney got even worse and extended to her left kidney and later also on her right side of the lower abdomen. After finishing the treatment, she could barely move so we went to A&E again. Same procedure, the results clearly showed a serious infection this time and the current doctor told her that if not properly treated it could get really bad. As a result the doctor sent a letter to her GP that she should be refereed urgently to do an X-ray of her kidneys and also to see a gynecologist. Also, the doctor said that the treatment she received the first time was wrong and he gave her a different antibiotic for 5 days. \nAfter taking the treatment which had no positive effect, her GP did not believe she had an infection and thought she had appendicitis instead. She was sent to Royal Derby Hospital to see a specialist team which consulted her and said that she does not have appendicitis. She was still filling ill and so she went again to see a doctor at A&E. This time, another doctor said that she has an infection and gave her the first treatment she received which was not effective. She told the doctor of her history and also about having gastritis but she would wanted to discuss and told her that is up to her choice if she wants this treatment or not. \nClearly, something went wrong here. She asked the doctors to make another test or something so they could find out what infection it is as the previous treatments did not work. I must say that she is having these symptoms for over three weeks and there is no improvement. I do not know what to do and who to speak with so she can receive the correct treatment. I am getting really worried as this infection can have permanent effect on her health.", "*May Be Triggering For Self-Harm/ Suicide*\nAbsolute worst experience I have had with medical staff following self-harm ever, and that is quite an achievement given how stigmatised this is.\nI had cut my arm. This was really an attempt at suicide but I didn't manage to cut badly enough. Obviously that makes me weak and means I don't mean it and am just seeking attention, according to staff.\nThe psychiatric liaison nurse was utterly disinterested and just wanted me out of there. I PLEADED for help and made it clear if I left I wouldn't be safe. He did nothing.\nI had blood tests as I had also overdosed. The doctor said that if these were OK I could go. I again said I wasn't safe to go, and would go home and commit suicide. The response: 'You can do it here if you want'.\nI don't even have the words. I am just hurt by it.

Scan results days later showed she had fribroids but also a infection which had to be dealt with first. A course of antibiotics was then prescribed but feeling so unwell she had to stay at the hospital in a extremely depressing hospital room. Days later with no feel of improvement she was sent home.

This must have been my 50th attempt at suicide. This is because I have given up hope and been shoved out by the system because I have 'complex' issues. Because 'talking' about these issues triggers me into self harm mode, I can't risk further appointments because I am only given 50 minutes once a week. I live alone. So what do I 'do' with these emotions and thoughts of suicide when I get home? I have tried over and over to explain this to them, but I feel, they just blame me for missing what is given. After the last overdose I was put on a section 2, and moved to a psychiatric ward. I wasn't formally admitted. The room hadn't been cleaned since the last patient, and 2 days later, they rescinded the section against my opinion, and sent me home alone. And that's been it!

It was a quick labour lasting a little under 4 hours. Everything seemed to be going fine until one of the midwives rushed out of the room. Seconds later a doctor rushed in. I was confused. I was not aware of the emergency bell being pressed, the panic and urgency for my baby to be born. I ended up having a rushed episiotomy. I was left in a state of shock as my baby was born blue, limp and not crying. I didn't understand why they were not giving him to me. I understand that in an emergency situation there isn't really time for an explanation.\nHowever, there were 3 people in the room, surely one of them could have reassured me about what had just happened to me and my baby, and why they had intervened. Even if it was just a quick summary. My consent was not given for a managed 3rd stage of labour. They took over completely at the end and everything was rushed which left me upset as there seemed to be no apparent concerns and I felt did not justify their actions. My birth plan was not discussed so I thought they were routinely carrying out a basic 3rd stage which I didn't want.\nThey did not explain anything to me. They did not explain what they were doing when they were checking and suturing me. I was in obvious pain but was asked \"Why are you hurting? We didn't touch you then. \" I was left in disbelief given what had just been done to me.\nThere was no excuse for my injuries not being mentioned to me, or the extent and degree. No one told me they were suturing me. No one told me how to care for the sutures. The post partum assessment and suturing procedure was not AT ALL explained. I was just left in pain with no explanation. I was not expecting the pain or intrusive examination which left me distressed.\nI was led to believe that they intervened unnecessarily as there was no explanation about anything. I was discharged with injuries that I knew nothing about until I saw it for myself, there were more stitches and injuries than I thought. I was left feeling violated. I didn't even know why I had an episiotomy in the first place! The communication was appalling from the start. A few bits of information and a little bit of compassion and I feel that I would not have had an issue with my baby's birth.\nI was also left with a midwife, that was actually a nurse training, that seemed not confident in what she was doing. I was not asked for permission for her to be in the room. I was left alone with her sometimes. It just seemed like they had no time for me! I felt like a guinea pig first time mum!\n3 years later when I arranged for a birth debrief (which I found out about through Birth Trauma Association) I was shocked to find out that I in fact had 5 separate injuries that were not mentioned to me at all! What if I had had problems? I wouldn't have had the faintest idea what to have said to the GP! They wrote all of this in my notes with me being not even a metre away yet had no consideration to even tell me! It took me 3 years to talk about it as I was left with PTSD, or birth trauma as it's also known. I was not aware of the birth debrief service. I have never gone back to the hospital since as I will suffer a panic attack. I am having to wait for therapy after suffering in silence for 3 years.\nOn top of that I received poor care whilst on the postnatal ward; no one helped me with breastfeeding when they said they would. I felt isolated and alone.\nWhen my baby was 8 days old, a community midwife insisted we go to the Leicester Royal Infirmary for suspected jaundice. After 3 unnecessary heel prick tests, I was told everything was fine and I could go home. It was 3am. I had no form of transport and I was led to believe I would be able to get transport from the hospital by a member of staff. I was then told they don't do that any more. All of this added to the trauma!\nNo one can give me back the last 3 years. No one can give back my first experience of becoming a mum. No one can take away the flashbacks. No one can take away the bad memories that I now have to live with for the rest of my life. It should have been the happiest day of my life, but instead it was tainted.\nThere seems to be absolutely no acknowlegment of the traumatic experiences women can have during childbirth. Having your body cut open suddenly without any explanation whatsoever is traumatic. Women are not just the package their baby comes in. What may be \"normal\" to medical staff is completely new, different and scary for the mother! I don't feel like I can trust any hospital with me in a vulnerable state ever again.", "following major surgery this year and a lengthy stay in hospital, I was discharged into the care of district nurses for home visits to dress large open wound. \nInitially, after a mix up with equipment, the care was reliable, but quickly deteriorated to the point where I now have to rely on family, with no medical background, to dress my wound. This is due to the fact that district nurses advised I do not fit the criteria for home visits now, so after having nurses attending every other day and on call service if required, I have have gone to no help at home at all and am expected to visit the treatment room on a daily basis with a very large open abdominal wound, which they do not have the proper equipment to clean and dress, why? ?\n The dressing falls apart after approx 8 hours, but I have to wait at least 24 hours to have it redressed, with risk of infection and tying me to my home, as the wound has a continuous fluid loss. I was previously on an machine to collect the fluid, but it was announced to me on two separate occasions how much the treatment cost, very unprofessional and unacceptable.\n The reason I had to have a break in using the machine is due to the fact that the district nurses were not cleaning the wound before redressing it and after a hospital visit, was advised by the nurse in charge of my care that she could not put me back on the machine at this point due to a build up of bacteria as the wound had not been getting cleaned. I must add that it has never been cleaned by the proper product at home by district nurses, again, I ask why? ? \nI am now also expected to attend udston hospital at weekends and public holidays and take my own supplies with me, that facility does not open until midday and has no appt system, so with a large abdominal wound I am expected to travel and wait in areas where there are air borne viruses. My partner and my daughter have attempted to speak to a team leader and last week 2 different dept at the health centre were asked to record my calls and ask a team leader to call me, no call, I have attempted many times to have a meeting for answers to questions, to no avail. \nI have been told the patient is at the centre of the care and everything is done to ensure the patient is comfortable and has a good quality of life. My quality of life and emotional state are seriously affected now. Who will help me and take my thoughts and feelings into account? Very depressing and demoralising.", "I have been suffering with severe anxiety and depression and self harm, I have been trying to help but no one seems to realise how bad things are for me, I try to express myself and no takes me serious, they think I'm fine, Recently things have got worse, I had the police out and the ambulance and they thought it would be a good idea to voluntarily admit myself into whitchurch hospital, for an assessment, so thought why not maybe they could help, maybe I could have a long think about how I want my life to be, so I went for the assessment.   Do you know what, I'm very upset and angry at the attitude I was given. I clearly explained why I wanted to admit myself, and apparently it wasn't good enough and they told me basically to \"get over it\" I was feeling very suicidal and upset, I said I can't be alone with my feelings, I will go home and take pills, but nobody did listen, they sent me home... I felt like my issues werent very important. So I have decided Just give up and not get help as seen as no wants to help me. Very very disappointed in the service! !", "I would like to feedback to you our family's experience of Community Health and specifically the Children's Complex Communication Team (CCDT).\nI have 2 sons. One is now 9 years old, he is diagnosed with Aspergers, ADHD, dyspraxia, dyslexia and Irlen Syndrome. As the waiting lists were very long for the ASD assessment my husband and I decided to have private assessments done. These were eventually accepted by the Trust and the NHS confirmed he had Aspergers without further NHS assessments.\nMy other son has just turned 7 and I noticed he was struggling around age 4. He had significant attention difficulties and saw a female clinician at the trust; she could see significant problems even though he was so young and was diagnosed with ADHD age 6. He is unable to be medicated for this as he has a very rigid, restricted diet due to sensory issues around food. Regarding this he has seen a dietician and play therapist at the Roxburgh Centre, but they couldn't help. A doctor who he was under at the time, (over a year), told me she thought he was autistic from the group of issues he was presenting.\nWe were experiencing constant oppositional behaviours from our younger son and he was saying he wanted to self harm. He saw a psychologist at the Queen Elizabeth hospital who referred him to CAMHS at the same time as the boys GP referred both boys to CAMHS at Thurlow, as my older son was also trying to self harm. The CAMHS referrals got lost twice and when they were assessed by CAMHS they said the boys did not meet tier 3. I contacted Point One but they would not see the boys because they were too complex!\nOur younger son has been assessed privately too, because of the NHS waiting lists and his extreme difficulties. He has been assessed numerous therapists and psychologists. The consensus was that he met the clinical diagnosis criteria for: ASD (high functioning) & Pathological Demand Avoidance. All the specialists highlighted significant attention difficulties and demand avoidant behaviours.\nOur younger son's reports went to a specialist around Feb 2014. At that time the specialist who had the report said they could not look at or assess PDA because it is not recognised in this area. With regards to the ASD \u2013 he would be referred to the CCDT, he was referred to them Feb/March 2014.\nPDA \u2013 Pathological Demand Avoidance\nThe child of a local friend who was displaying PDA behaviours, who goes to the same GP surgery as us, was referred to the Elizabeth Newson Centre around the end of 2012. The Elizabeth Newson Centre is the recognised centre for PDA in the country. This child's assessment was funded by the PCT because PDA assessments were not available locally. This child was assessed for PDA, diagnosed at the centre.\nMy GP from the same surgery was more than happy to refer our younger son to the Elizabeth Newson Centre for assessment, but he needed the specialists agreement. The specialist would not agree to this although has since put a request in to panel in February 2015. I have heard nothing since and find it hard to believe there has been no discussion or conclusion to the request in this time, five months.\nIt should be noted that another specialist who assessed my younger son, is also regarded as an expert in the field PDA, The Elizabeth Newson Centre (who now have a significant waiting list themselves) refer parents to the same specialist.\nLooking at the NICE guidelines for the assessment of Autism it does not state anywhere that the assessments have to be carried out by different members of an autism team. One doctor states the specialist cannot do a follow up ADOS along with another S& L therapist who has not seen our younger son before although the same doctor said one further assessment is necessary to confirm the private reports.\nThe NICE guidelines state that a diagnostic team should:\n\u2018consider using a diagnostic tool such as the DISCO, the ADI-R or the ADOS'\nIt does not state anywhere that you need an ADOS. In fact it later states that teams \u2018should not rely on any autism-specific tool alone to diagnose'\nThe ADOS is a good, structured play-based assessment. However, the scoring is based upon the opinion and the expertise of the examiners. It is not objective. The scoring system should never be used as a yes or no for a diagnosis confirmation. It was never intended for that purpose. \nSo why my doctor saying our younger son needs an ADOS before they will agree with his diagnosis? He has had three separate lengthy assessments by three different highly qualified professionals all coming to the same conclusion.\nIt has taken over 17 months for our younger son to be anywhere near an appointment with the CCD Team with his behaviour and self -esteem going downhill rapidly and he still hadn't been seen hence the private reports so for the team to say they aren't good enough whilst following NICE guidelines is in my opinion unacceptable.\nDoctors won't accept the specialists assessment and diagnosis but they also wouldn't refer our younger son to the Elizabeth Newson Centre for an assessment until I complained. PDA strategies and support are different to ASD strategies.\nSo, again I am having to pay for and ask a specialist and the other professionals to sign a declaration that says they assessed our son as per NICE guidelines. I was hopeful that this would have been good enough for his ASD/PDA diagnosis to be accepted, as in the case of my older son.\nMy main contention is that how one minute the CCD Team accept the speciliasts reports for our older son, but for his brotjer they do not, they are being inconsistent. This is unacceptable.\nSo, I have 2 young boys, both with significant difficulties relating to the autistic spectrum and associated areas. Everyone talks about early intervention being essential, but I have no support. I am struggling to even get diagnosis. Unfortunately, in education the school put a lot of emphasis on having an appropriate diagnosis, I would assume so they do not waste valuable resource putting in place the wrong strategies.\nI just wanted to make the trust  aware of how difficult the CCD Team (CCDT) are making things with regards to neurodevelopment assessments. With the waiting times being so long, as parents desperate to know how to help your child to avoid psychological issues in the future early intervention is key, but this is being denied to us as a family because as long as school do not have a firm diagnosis to work with they will avoid having to put correct PDA procedures in place, causing our younger son significant stress and anxiety.\nI really hope this changes for families in the future.", "Dear unhappy man\r\nI'm really sorry we have let you down in supporting you with your dressing.

He had been admitted to the Western General in August 2014 where the care and attention he received was totally outstanding. In the past I have had nothing but the utmost respect for the NHS.\nThis is why I was completely unprepared for the treatment he got when he was moved to Ellen's Glen three weeks later\nArrival at Ellen's Glen\nDue to the circumstances of the transfer, I had no opportunity to visit Ellen's Glen before my husband was sent there.\nWhen we arrived the nurse in charge was busy on her computer. She showed us to the room my husband had been allocated and left us. It was a single room with the door closed and the TV on. He was fully dressed in outdoor clothing and was covered with a thick duvet. By this time he was incapable of moving at all so the bed cover would have remained in place with him sweltering beneath it had we not arrived when we did.\nThere was no jug of water and we had to ask for one. We also asked if someone could explain about Ellen's Glen House to us.\nI was alarmed at the indifferent approach and phoned the Western General after we had been there for over an hour without anyone appearing. The nurse who had been in charge of the ward at the Western when my husband was there said she would contact Ellen's Glen herself.\nIn the meantime, a nurse came to speak to us.\nHe:\n- thought my husband was my father\n- didn't know he had come from Western General\n- didn't know that he was blind and couldn't feed himself\n- didn't know that he was incapable of calling out for help\n- talked about his care being reviewed every six months ( although he had been given days to live )\n- said that they would check on him every 3 to 4 hours which was totally inappropriate\nEventually a senior nurse at Ellen's Glen came to speak to us. She apologised and said she had been dealing with a staffing issue. We discussed his care. She said that the door to his room would normally be open but they had just had a fire alarm check and had not had time to go round to reopen all the doors.\nI was not happy with their level of attention or understanding of his condition. It was also very noisy - loud music or TVs (presumably because people were hard of hearing) and people calling for assistance. It was not the quieter environment I had been told he required and was one of the reasons for sending him there.\nNormally Ellen's Glen has limited periods for visiting but they said that we could have the same open visiting that we had had at the Western General because of my husband's condition and his very limited life expectancy.\nI was not happy with the casual attitude and went back to the Western General to see if they could take him back. This was not possible so I returned to Ellen's Glen.\nCare Plan\nI met with the nurse in charge and the nurse who was in the process of making up his care plan. I asked if they were using the Western's Care Plan in the interim. They replied that they did not use care plans from other sources and preferred to make up their own. This in spite of the Western General being a centre of excellence for the brain disease he was suffering from. Although he had been there for several hours, their care plan was still incomplete.\nI can accept that they would want to develop their own care plan, but surely they should have used the previous one until they completed theirs? They said they had no experience of the condition he was suffering from but had checked it on the NHS website. I said that I was unhappy that my husband effectively had no care plan in place despite the fact that he had been in the care of NHS Lothian for three weeks.\nI informed them that because his brain was dying, he was suffering from hallucinations which really frightened him. It was imperative that a drug which had been recommended for his condition be administered when the need arose. He was no longer able to tell them or call for help. If they were only checking periodically, it was likely that they would miss the signs that he was hallucinating as you had to be close to his bed to pick up the signals. A cursory glance as they walked past an open door would not suffice. I volunteered to bring in a private nurse to stay with him 24/7. At this point they agreed to provide this extra cover themselves.\nThe following day I met with the same two nurses and the doctor who was in charge of his case. This was the doctor's first experience of his particular illness, but she said that she had checked up on it. I told them that this was a particularly aggressive form - less than four weeks earlier he had walked into the Eye Pavilion for an appointment. Doctors at the Brain Research Unit in London who had come to assess him two weeks prior to his transfer to Ellen's Glen had given him approximately three weeks to live ie he only had one week left. ( He actually lasted a few days beyond that )\nI explained how it was easy to miss the hallucinations unless there was someone with him at all times. They explained how they gave palliative care to treat the symptoms, irrespective of the disease.\nAt this stage I was happy that my concerns were being addressed and they were providing appropriate care.\nDaily care in Ellen's Glen\nI think that they provided 24/7 cover (with the nurse leaving the room when we visited) for the next two or three days. They then removed the continuous cover, but did not inform me. By the time I became aware of this, my husband's condition had deteriorated and his level of consciousness was much reduced, as were the hallucinations. Accordingly I did not comment on the removal of the 24/7 cover.\nSubsequently I became concerned again about his condition and the level of attention he was receiving. Accordingly, we arranged to be there ourselves throughout the day. For years he suffered from a chronic back problem which could cause pain when lying on his back, which is the position he was in. I often had to find someone to tell them that he was in pain, or that the motor drive syringe was empty. On one occasion when he was in pain, it was found that the syringe line had become disconnected. Their regular checks were missing these things.\nI also found Ellen's Glen House to be a distressing place, with patients regularly calling out for help and being routinely ignored. For example, we went to help an old lady who had got tangled up in her blankets and had been calling for help to no avail and the same old lady calling out she needed the toilet, again with no-one to help. On that occasion I rang the bell for her twice and when help finally arrived she was ticked off.\nI also noticed when visiting, that often we were not being interrupted for the regular checks to be done. When I mentioned this, I was told that they liked to leave visitors in peace. I was not happy that the visitors thus became the de facto carers, while the professionals did something else. I had no confidence that the checks were being done when I was not there. There was also the quality of the checks - on one occasion the nurse came in to pick up the folder and then stood outside the door to complete the lengthy checklist \u2013 it seemed that she had picked up all the information she needed in a glance while passing. Tick box care seemed to be the order of the day.\nOften the entry against a heading was AS (asleep). Presumably this was intended to be used when it would not be appropriate to disturb a sleeping patient. Later I mentioned to another nurse that my husband appeared to be sleeping, but no-one sleeps for 24 hours. She said that it was probably more akin to a coma than sleep. However, AS still went on the check list.\nTransfer back to the Western General blocked\nEventually I became frustrated at the neglect that I felt he was suffering. I was getting nowhere with Ellen's Glen House so I contacted the Western and the research people who had visited him from London to say that I was withdrawing my consent to a post mortem. They were aware of my full co-operation before this, so appreciated that I did not take this step lightly. It was the only thing I could think of at the time to make someone take notice.\nThe following morning I got a call from the Western General to say that they were taking my husband back. I was delighted and relieved, as the care that he had received at the Western General was superb. They said that we would have to wait for an ambulance to become available and that Ellen's Glen House would arrange the transfer.\nLater that day I was at my husband's bedside when a doctor came in. The doctor gave him a cursory glance and asked how he was to which I replied 'catatonic'.  The doctor then asked if they could speak to me in the lounge and we left the room. I told the doctor that the Western was taking him back. The doctor replied that this was unprecedented and would have to check with someone higher.\nAn hour or so later, the doctor asked to see me and informed me that they had assessed my husband's condition and was blocking the transfer. The doctor had jurisdiction as his doctor in Ellen's Glen House. When I repeated that I wanted him to be transferred, I was asked if I had power of attorney. I did not.\nI felt that the doctors decision was driven more by dogma than by my husband's condition, as the doctor had barely looked at him when they came into the room. The doctor said they had consulted the nursing staff and based on their reports, had decided that he was not well enough to be moved so  was blocking the transfer. I found the doctor's attitude to be confrontational and completely lacking in empathy.\nMy husband endured for a further four days, during which time he continued to have neither food nor fluids. The ghastliness of his illness was compounded by our concern about the level of care he had received in Ellen's Glen during the last twelve days of his life.\nWhat was good? Some of the staff were conscientious and caring.\n? Read my account - it's obvious. Don't ignore patients who are calling for help. Give patient care priority over paperwork.", "My next door neighbour has very little memory and is usually highly confused, we've lived in our flat for the past 4 years and have noticed him wandering outside on many occasions usually in the freezing cold or blistering heat for anything from 2-10 hours! , recently this has been a daily occurrence, I've phoned emergency adult social care 4 times now and only just managed to get a hold of the code for a key safe on the side of his house to let him in, I let him into his house on a daily basis now.\nHe invited me in and I followed to make sure he was getting in ok, by the time we reached the top of the stairs...he'd forgotten why I was their and assumed I had been sent to help look for his glasses. What I saw in there honestly shocked me to the point of tears, I couldn't believe that someone who gets bi-weekly visits from a social worker could live in such a state, I don't blame his personal social worker...I'm sure she's doing all she can and that she cares for the people she visits.\nI don't know if this is a common occurrence, something that she see's a lot but a 76 year old man shouldn't have to live in such a state. The kitchen is rotten..fly infested, his bedroom has no walkable space, no place to lie down and rest, his living room was not liveable and I didn't dare to venture into the bathroom.\nMy point is this, how can a man be deemed \"able to look after himself\" when his house isn't liveable, when he can't understand what is happening around him?\nHow can his house be like that for 3 years or more without anybody helping him....a professional care worker literally walks into that house every couple of weeks and yet nothing has happened\nThe part that worried me most...he pointed to a sheet of tablets and said \"sweeties! \".\nThere were plenty of half smoked cigarettes dotted around the place and it's only a matter of time before he burns down the house, either smoking or trying to cook, or he'll get an infection from the poor living conditions and become extremely ill. Either way it's very serious that he gets help soon.", "I wanted to post a response to this story from Patient Opinion.

The reason I had sculptra injections was because I had a fat graft to the face for lypodistrophy ( fat loss ) and further fat grafting was stopped and I was referred for sculptra.\n The reason I was referred for sculptra was, I believe, due to maladministration. The story is complicated. The person who injected me with sculptra was a traniee registrar plastic surgery. They had very little if any experience with this product which resulted in servere granulomas and nodules - forming immediately, causing me signicant disfigurement and pain, which still hasnt improved in 3 years.\n I have received no explanation, no redress or offer to put it right and worse than all that has happened: I have been completely ignored, there was no investigation or action of any kind. I feel this is in contradiction to the nhs constitution - which obviously means nothing and my life has been ruined as a result.\nAlso, in 3 years, whilst under the care of Chelsea &Westminster hospital, London, I have developed terrible neuralgia inflammation of the cranial arteries, with severe and distressing headaches. I have had 3 tests, in 3 years - zero support for pain; zero diagnosis, despite there being many tests to discover what is causing the inflammation, as well as massive arteritis type veins on my head with terrible tenderness in the right cranial regions; absolutely nothing has been done to help me.\nI'm suffering with acute attacks - around 3 a month and I'm left like an animal to suffer. It is easier to delay as much as possible, any tests because of costs, In my case I've been provided with nothing. My life is hell!", "My mother was admitted to Wishaw General Hospital on Wednesday night into Ward 18, she was settled into bed and was going for an abdominal XRay at some point that night. Nurses were very helpful and friendly and told my sister and I when we were leaving to call just after midnight. \nShe was nil by mouth, had been commenced on IV Infusion and also they had passed a urinary catheter, she was also going to have an abdominal CT Scan the next day.\n We called in the morning, my sister and her husband visited in the afternoon and my husband and I visited the following evening. No-one, doctors or nurses had asked to speak with us.\n Mum had now been moved to another ward. Mum was sitting up at her bedside and I asked her how she was feeling, she replied, 'not very well and I have to go for an operation tomorrow. ' Mum has Dementia and I suspected that this was not correct information and went to speak with a nurse.\n I had to wait to ask her Named Nurse about her progress.. She didn't know that she was going to theatre for an operation tomorrow until she checked her notes and noted that the surgeon had been in to see her that evening and documented in the notes that she was to have a laparotomy and sigmoid resection tomorrow.\n I was shocked as no-one had spoken with us re findings of her CT Scan, no surgeon had asked to speak with us, no family was with my Mum (who has Dementia) and no nurse was with the doctor when he told her that she needed an operation.\n This is certainly not Person Centred Care. \nHer named Nurse said she would see if there was a doctor available to speak with me, but she thought they were in theatre. I eventually left. I called the ward in the morning, I left for work but became very concerned about Mum and the details of her impending operation.\n I decided to phone to ask to speak with a doctor, I was awaiting on her Named Nurse coming to take my call when my a doctor phoned me on my mobile to explain that Mum was going to theatre within the hour.....the scan showed that she had a volvus, a twist in the large bowel, it could cause ischaemia and she really needed this operation for the obstruction in her large bowel. She would have a laparotomy and sigmoid resection and she will have a stoma. \nI thanked her for the information but told her that I was unhappy that I hadn't been told the day before, that I was not with Mum and that the Named Nurse didn't even know that she was going to theatre for surgery. \nI explained that this poor communication resulted in my Mum being told on her own that she was for surgery, she didn't even know what she was getting done or why. \nAt least, a nurse should have been with her to explain and reassure. The doctor offered to speak with me if I came down to the ward. I went down to see Mum before she left for theatre, the anaethetist came to visit her whilst I was in, he explained that it was a big operation that she was getting done and that she was elderly and frail but she had no medical history/concerns. I left Mum and she was waiting to go to theatre.\nI got a call that evening that she was in Adult Critical Care after her surgery, my sister and I went down to see her, I asked the nurse who was looking after her if there was any cancer that caused the obstruction but she said that cancer hadn't been mentioned but the tissue is sent to lab as usual.\n The surgeons were still working in theatre so no contact was made again; the following 2 days we still didn't speak with medical staff, I thought we would definitely see someone on the Monday. On the Monday she was moved to the step down cubicle in Ward 18 as she was improving. I didn't think she was too good on the Monday afternoon, the Nurse was very kind and helpful, he told me that I could visit in the afternoons this week as I was going to be Nightshift and unable to visit in the evenings. \nTuesday morning I phoned in the early morning to ask how she had been overnight, whilst trying to phone the ward, the nurse phoned me to tell me that there had been a deterioration overnight in Mum's condition, they were discussing transferring her back to Adult Critical Care and the anaethetists were with her and would like to speak with me. \nI left home immediately, she was extremely poor, her condition had deteriorated.....one of the anaethetists told me that the operation for the CANCER had all been to much for her, that her organs were failing. \nI said, my MUM doesn't have cancer, that was the first time cancer was mentioned. Mum was moved into a sideroom and I sat with her, she died peacefully 20 minutes later, my sister didn't arrive in time before she died.\n The Nurses in this ward were extremely caring and compassionate but the lack of communication between the doctors and the nurses, and the medical staff and the family is very poor. This can be avoided, this can easily be improved. \nAlso, patients with dementia should not be treated in this way.\nDuring Mum's short illness she had been been well looked after by the nurses and she died peacefully and with dignity. It now helps me to know that she didn't know she had cancer or that she had a stoma, and that she didn't suffer.", "Dear CatherineMo,\r\nI am so sorry to hear about the passing of your mum, please accept my sincere condolences to you and your family.\r\nI read with great disappointment, your description of the lack of communication we provided to you and your mother at a time of great stress, please accept my apologies.

I was at the hospital at the appointed time as arranged, was prepared for keyhole surgery and about to be anesthetized when the surgeon asked them to stop. After apologizing he explained there were no instruments in theatre for the operation to go ahead.\nI wrote to the hospital to raise my concerns at the very late cancellation.\nThe operation was rescheduled to later in the month, this time it went ahead as anticipated.\nIn the recovery room as I was coming round from the anesthetic I was confused by the number of incisions as I had expected only one small incision due to the keyhole procedure that had been explained to me.\nAlso whilst in the recovery room the surgeon came to see me and asked if I had taken pain killers and suggested that I did in order to relax my body and to reduce the discomfort I would feel when the anesthetic wore off. He left before I was able to ask him about the incisions.\nI asked the nurse for painkillers as recommended. I asked for co-codamol as I am allergic to some painkillers but have successfully taken co-codamol in the past. The nurse said tramadol had been written up in my notes, I assumed this would be OK as I knew my notes had details about my allergies.\nThe tramadol was administered intravenously and very soon I started to feel the warning symptoms of going into anaphylactic shock. I asked the nurse to stop the drip immediately and take the tube out of my arm, also to get the epi pen from my bag and to administer the adrenalin. Because of the emergency situation a number of nurses had gathered but none of them knew how to use the epi pen and I ended up treating myself.\nOnce things had returned to normal I asked them what the procedure was in these circumstances, amazed that there was no training in / knowledge of using something as simple as an epi pen.\nI feel the outcome could have been very different if I had not stopped the drip in time, on reflection I should have had a red band on my wrist to indicate possible allergic reactions but this was missing. There seem to have been a catalogue of errors regarding my treatment and have raised these concerns with the hospital from whom I am still waiting to hear. I'm also interested in having an explanation for the 9 incisions during the keyhole surgery.", "Hi Gene  \r\nThanks for providing further information and I'm sorry to hear that you have had difficulty getting through to our PALS team.  \r\nIn order for us to be able to deal with your complaint appropriately, we do need you to send this information directly to us at the trust.

This investigation was carried out by Surrey County Council in response to an alert by a Tissue Viability Nurse who was requested to visit the home in August 2014 in connection with pressure ulcers on my father's body. The first pressure ulcer was first observed back in March 2014 and the situation became significantly worse due to poor management over a period of five months. The outcome of the safeguarding investigations found that there were failures at the home and concurred with the Tissue Viability Nurse's original report in August 2014 that she had not been alerted to my father's situation early enough by the nursing home staff. Additionally, it was found that the nursing staff required updated training in order to effectively treat pressure sores in the future.\r\nBelvedere House Nursing Home comes under the umbrella of The Royal Alfred Seafarers' Society and the patron is HRH The Princess Royal.

My experience there was horrific. Staff were utterly unorganised and insensitive. \n\nI felt that they did not treat patients who were struggling with respect, often rolling their eyes at them, shouting at them or uttering derogatory remarks behind their backs. Most of them seemed utterly clueless when it came to offering advice and help to patients. Most made useless remarks or even unpleasant comments. \n\nI made further suicide attempts while there. No one removed ligatures or other materials from my possession upon admission or even shortly before I left. \n\nI felt very lonely and scared as I was left to grapple with suicidal feelings and risk on my own. The consultant psychiatrist there was in my opinion the worst psychiatrist I have encountered in my eight years with mental health services. They were  threatening, did not listen to what I had to say and I felt they were generally incompetent. After almost two months there a patient I was very close with committed suicide while on leave. I am absolutely dismayed that this service is allowed to continue functioning despite such an incident.", "After a weekend of being unwell I rang for help at 111 and the out of hours doctor was very good at first and said he would get me the help I so desperately needed. He said he would ring back after calling the mental health team at Musgrove Park Hospital. He then left me a message on my phone.  My understanding of the message was that-Mental Health said I wasn't ill and said if I felt suicidal to go and kill myself, that it was my choice.\nWho really wants to feel like this is a choice. It just shows how bad things have got when someone in the caring profession goes and tells you to die.\nNot sure if it's down to being understaffed or lack of cash or both but it's sad and scary when you find yourself in a dire situation like this.

Was kept in two days and then sent home. Ten days later felt baby moving about and went to the hospital two hours later only to be told that sadly the baby was dead. Baby delivered by C Section and was a beautiful little baby. When asked why the baby had died they told us that it was due to kidney failure as she did not have enough water. So why oh why did they send her home when her waters broke? We think the baby should have been delivered and put into an incubator.

No discharge was arranged until I challenged them despite her receiving no treatment, just a shambles, and then, and this is the scary bit, the doctor signed a DNR form with no reference to me or any member of the family against all the guidelines.", "I recently (well, probably about six+ months ago now) was referred to the Single Point of Acess team for a referral for specialist treatment. I had previously lived in Gateshead, had seen a CBT therapist but had agreed after about 9 or 10 sessions that I needed to reflect more on trauma that had happened to me rather than just how to change/move forward (the rumination, as he called it, is pretty bad). We agreed on DBT.\nI was told by the nurse I had seen that I would be referred to the Traumatic Stress Service. I turned up there, and was told it was a very short service, and they could not refer me to any other services. She then wrote a letter to my doctor referring me back to you.\nFurther to this, during both my meeting with SPoA and the Traumatic Stress Service, I was asked about an overdose in 2014, that actually occurred three years prior in 2011. This happened whilst at university. To add insult to injury, I had already told SPoA this and that it happened during my time at university, I was given NO HELP during this time (even though I had tried to kill myself...it was just exam stress, apparently...) and ended up struggling for another year and a bit and ended up dropping out. This has affected my self esteem massively, which is why I'm only just able to really get on with my life now. To have people not listen to you, and seemingly not care or understand the severity of how I felt then and how angry I am still about my treatment in Lancashire, that it adds to anxieties I have about pursuing treatment which in the long term I know will do me no good...it's pretty terrible.\nOverall, it's taken me far longer than it should have to get the appropriate treatment for my needs, there's very poor communication within the service and to an extent, nurses and therapists that don't really listen (when the TSS referred me back to my doctor, for example, she described me as a single female, despite the large portion of our conversation taken up with me telling her I'd moved about WITH MY PARTNER who I AM STILL WITH. )\nIt's really no good...", "Many thanks for taking the time to share your feedback.

I am a seventy one year old male and want to tell you about my experience. The reason I need to tell you is because have exhausted all possible avenue's for lodging a complaint. I have written to my local MP and David Cameron who all they advised is to go to the Health Ombudsman, I had previously done this with no joy. I have also been advised to bring it to the attention of PALS but this no longer exists at the Salisbury Hospital. If the Salisbury Hospital investigate the complaint the final decision is made by the Chief Executive of Salisbury Hospital. I have had a seven year battle with this department and can only be advised to go to the Ombudsman which I have already done. Basically all this means is that despite the seriousness it impossible to make a complaint.\nApproximately seven years ago I was referred to Salisbury District Hospital for pains in my chest and upper abdomen. No diagnosis was made. On my first appointment the consultant performed a rectal examination and found I had an enlarged prostate but he never told me. After about eighteen months I requested my GP to do a PSA blood test, after being referred to a Urologist and a biopsy I was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer.\nAfter several visits to my GP over the next 3 years and being rushed into hospital on two occasions with the chest pains I was eventually diagnosed with Pulmonary Embolisms. I was prescribed warfarin and within days the chest pains had gone. It was confirmed by thrombosis clinic that I had these clots for at least from 2007.\nI have also undergone a total knee replacement at Salisbury District Hospital that was a disaster whereby fragments of bone were left in the back of the new knee. I have been in considerable pain with this and have had a second opinion at the Spire Hospital, Southampton. The consultant at the Spire confirmed that fragments of bone had been left in but it would not be remove them unless a complete new procedure was performed at a cost of \u00a335000.", "Good afternoon fleetwoodmacfan\r\nThank you for taking the time to leave your feedback on the patient opinion site, I am sorry to learn that you feel that your experiences of the services provided by Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (CPFT) have been poor.\r\nTo enable me to look into your concerns and to be able to learn from your experiences I would appreciate it if you could contact me so we can discuss.

She was dehydrated and barely eating or drinking very weak, she was given a ct scan and a 'mass' was detected in her bowel, I was told a further scan was needed, (to help determine whether the mass was a tumor), I was, in fact, specifically told that taking my mother home could leave her at risk of internal bleeding, (as they said that the medication she was being given for lung congestion, could cause internal bleeding if the mass was cancer), so it was important to diagnose this asap, so she waited for the scan....\nShe stayed there from august to the end of October!\nOn some visits, I would find my mother left on a toilet, (my mother can't stand unaided so has to be helped to and from the toilet), where she had been left.\nOn one occasion (when I had arrived half an hour early, my mother was very distressed because she wanted to go to toilet, I went to ask a nurse for help and when I politely asked \" can you please help my mother she is desperately needs the toilet\" I was asked very angrily why was I on the ward so early, who told me I could call so early, and that visiting times didn't start for half an hour!'  I apologised and said ' I'm sorry I was unaware I won't arrive early again, now can you PLEASE help my mother? ' by the time she came mum mother had soiled herself, it was horrible to see her so distressed.\nOn a visit in sept I found my mother slumped in the chair next to her bad, she kept complaining about being tired and how sore her bottom was, I tried to help her into bed only to discover that she had soiled herself and the excrement had dried to her skin! Her bottom was red and sore, she must have been like that for hours. I asked the staff for help and they changed and cleaned her, but how much longer would she have been left like that if I hadn't seen it? She was complaining she was sore, but none of the staff had bothered to check her.\nIn October I visited and found my mothers arm had been bandaged, I asked the staff how it happened. I was told it was an old wound that had reopened, I told them that couldn't be the case as it hadn't been there the day before. NO one could tell me how she had injured herself.\nThe Lack of communication is mind boggling, for the first month I had to repeatedly explain to the staff that my mother had Alzheimer's. On occasion recently my mother complained that she had pain when trying to urinate, I reported this to the staff, only to be told 'Oh when we asked her she said she was fine' I explained again that she has alzheimer's so unless she is asked whilst it is happening, she forgets! On both these occasions I was told that a doctor would be informed... this didn't happen.\nIn October I was taken (into the staff lunch/common room) and amidst lunchboxes and coats, I was told that as my mother had refused to drink the prep for the scan due that day, it was pointless her being in hospital, and that she could now have the scan as an outpatient.\nI was extremely angry, esp and it was implied by the doctor that I had just left my mother there, \"Your mother has been in hospital since August\" (I was appalled at the stupidity of the statement), I asked Why I had been told that she may bleed internally (with the current medication she is on), without proper diagnosis, and was told  after a meeting they decided that there is 'no significant risk of internal bleeding'\". I then asked, \"and if she does bleed internally what do I do? \" I was told the markers are anemia, lethargy, weakness etc. and to bring her back in immediately if I was worried.  I said\"my mother barely eats, is always tired and lethargic\".\nThe doctor merely nodded.\nSo now I am waiting for the hospital to sort out a care package for my mother so she can come home. I don't hold out much hope as I received a call yesterday from the hospital social worker who asked if I was happy if they reinstated a care package they had on their files (It was over 1 year ago! ! ! ! when she was mobile and only needed her lunch made! ). I finally exploded, \"No it was not acceptable! I was not happy with that arrangment, mum can barely walk, can't wipe her own bottom properly, soils herself 2 -3 times a day, barely eats or drinks. and yet this information hasn't been passed onto the social worker about a patient who is in the same building! ! ! ! ! !\nI teach in a primary school, and have a duty of care to those children, and if I treated any of them the way my mother has been treated I would lose my job.", "My father had a major seizure in 2013 that the local A&E insisted was a diabetic hypo. He was referred for an urgent brain scan by our GP: the local hospital initially failed to act on the referral claiming not to have received it, then made an appointment for 4 months later, finally reduced to 3 months later.  \r\nAfter the scan he was seen by Neurology that same month at the end of 2013, assessed and told he might have Dementia. Four months later in 2014 he was told by Neurology that nothing on his brain MRI suggested Dementia, that he had Epilepsy and so was put on increasing doses of Keppra. He had back pain and then also rib pain from the seizure in 2013 onwards which he reported each time he ended up in A&E due to seizures and on every visit to Neurology, but nothing was done about it until he was seen by a Diabetes / Endocrinology Consultant in July 2014 for a by now suspected Insulinoma (which the specialist told him was unlikely) and was sent for immediate back x-rays.  \r\nThe results of those x-rays seemingly disappeared as our GP and others were told they couldn't be located when they tried to follow up on them, however, they are now in his file. My father was finally booked for an MRI mid-August 2014, after which he became mostly immobile and bedridden.  \r\nThat MRI finally showed by then Stage 4 secondary cancer through his spine, ribs and liver, with a mass on one kidney and an extremely enlarged prostate - medical staff mentioned that his prostate had been removed in 2012, but there it was larger than life on a CT scan, his notes were incorrect. He died exactly seven weeks after being given the diagnosis, having been left in the care of Neurology instead of Oncology who simply told him because of his age (in his seventies) and state of health there was no longer a treatment option available.  \r\nThe hospital forced the issue of dumping him in a nursing home on a Saturday morning, when admissions were only Monday to Friday, where he died 6 days later. For the 6 weeks he was on the Neurology ward at the end of his life we constantly had to explain to staff that he was dying from terminal cancer and wasn't just a whinger with a bit of backache.  \r\nWe now have his medical records that show inaccuracies and staff believing he had Dementia during those last weeks of his life. My father endured suffering for months on end because of the local hospital constantly ignoring the pain he was in and that was with his family supporting him and pushing for help for him as well as querying whether it could be cancer and being told no.  \r\nIt seemed as though Neurology had failed my father and Oncology did not want to get involved because of those mistakes. A senior member of nursing staff told another relative we were overreacting because the Neurology Consultant called us in for a meeting, and was stunned to be told my father was dying of cancer. The Ward Manager was mainly interested in discharging him and the Social Worker was told to apologise for approaching my father about going into a nursing home - he thought he had Dementia and was unaware that he was dying - but no apology was forthcoming.  \r\nNeurology did their best those last 6 weeks but they were not Oncologists. Nursing staff did not seem to understand the importance of keeping his pain levels under control, it seemed patient privacy - and perhaps an attempt to cover up the seriousness of what had gone wrong - led to a need to ask for pain relief for him on a number of occasions. Plus staff reluctance to work with certain colleagues led to patients not being seen when two staff were needed to help patients. And this is only a summary.", "I am truly sorry for the poor experience you and your father had at our hospital, and would like to offer my condolences. Our Clinical Directors for Cancer and Neurology are keen to meet with you and your family so we can discuss this further and ensure that we learn from any mistakes. I'd be grateful if you could get in touch with me so that I can arrange this for you.  \r\nWendy Matthews-Interim Chief Nurse", "My niece is in her early 20's and recently placed at gold tops after leaving mental health.\nIt is promised that they will help the young advance up the table to get back into the community and to help them manage benefits etc...\nWell this is not the case.\nIm led to believe that they have failed to do this but instead they left my niece to fend for her self in a capital city of drugs.\nShe' s a very vulnerable girl and no clue of a normal life gold tops offered no support for her just left her to defend her self. no activities through the day very minimal visits from her c. p. n or social worker.\nShe's been in mental health most of her childhood and resided in London until I was able to get her back to wales.\nI'm very dissapointed with the lack of service they offered my niece.", "I have again read what I believe to be is an appalling letter written by my consultant psychiatrist to my GP which grossly misrepresents what I said and contains many other problematic elements.\nThey say that their findings are limited to what I have observed during her treatment under my care in 2014\nthere are already a number of problems with this single statement. Why are they only basing their findings on 2014 when I have an 18 year history recorded in my notes? Surely any sensible clinical approach would take my history into account? Why does the consultant see their role as being limited to observation? Surely a basic part of being a medical doctor is that you need to gather information about symptoms? In other areas of medicine this could include scans and blood tests but in psychiatry surely the main way of examining a patient is by asking them questions?\nThere is an implication here that they had provided \u201ccare\u201d. That has not been my experience. The consultant turned me away when I explained that I needed to increase my anti psychotic to the maximum dose and that my GP had needed to prescribe the maximum dose of lorazopam. They did not ask any questions such as what was happening to you that made you feel you needed to increase your medication? If they asked this I would have been able to respond by saying that I was hardly sleeping at all, was finding it hard to concentrate and focus on anything at all including following a TV programme, that I was sending very long emails to my friends late at night and spending far more money that usual. I already had a diagnosis of bi polar disorder so for me it seems only sensible for them to check out if I was experiencing any symptoms of bi polar disorder, especially if we take into account that I become so unwell I had been sectioned and in intensive care only a year earlier. All the psychaitrist did was tell me to continue with the maximum dose of qutirepine and then dismissed me knowing that my next planned appointment was not for another 2 months. They did not put in place any care or support from any other member of the team. This highlights another problem in relation to observation. My condition deteriorated rapidly after this appointment as I was being expected to manage a psychosis alone with no support other than provided my GP practice. My consultant did not see me during this 2 months as this happened therefore they were  not able to \u201cobserve\u201d this.\n\nAnd if we examine the concept of treatment I am left with more questions and confusion that the psychiatrist has never answered. In the next paragraph they describe me as \u201crelatively stable\u201d. If they believe this why did they  advise me to continue on the maximum dose of anti psychotics which was nearly twice the dose I had been taking previously? If they did not believe I was suffering from a relapse of my bi polar disorder why did they not discuss this change in my medication with me and why were they so angry with me when I told them at a later date that I had decreased it because I was suffering severe side effects? If the psychiatric opinion was that I was not suffering a relapse and therefore did not need this dose of mediation they should have shared that opinion with me. Yet they advised the complete opposite and to continue with the maximum dose.\n\nThe psychiatrist implied that a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder was made which is not the case.  I feel strongly that a diagnosis of personalty disorder has been implied by them and any confusion I have about the issue of my diagnosis has happened because they have consistently refused to engage in any open and honest discussion about this and this has left me in a situation where I have to find out what they are thinking by reading the letters to my GP. I thought the purpose of these letters was to inform the GP not the patient?\nI have been told by the clinical director that my diagnosis has not been changed which means that throughout 2014 my contact with the CMHT was because I suffered from bi polar disorder for which I need care and treatment. I did not receive this from that team in 2014.\n\n What I said was that clearly my illness is potentially life threatening given that I have been sectioned because I have been a danger to myself while suffering from mania and psychosis twice, once only 2 years before this letter was written. That is all factually correct and is recorded in my medical records which the consultant told me they do not have time to read. I went on to say that we are dealing with potentially life threatening situations. It is because I know this, have always known it, given how unwell I was with my very first episode when I was sectioned at the age of 20 that I work hard to recognise my early warn signs and act quickly to avoid becoming so unwell. I would have thought most doctors would embrace this way of working. The only reason my manic episode did not progress as it had done the year previously (when I had ended up sectioned) was because I increased my dose of anti psychotics rapidly myself as I have done countless times over the past 19 years. I have to do this because until the past year or so no medication had ever worked in a preventive way for me. \n\nThis is quite a rare situation for someone with bi polar disorder to be in as most people do respond to standard drug treatments. Again if my diagnosis remains bi polar disorder then it is well known to be a potentially life threatening condition. My anxiety is that I am now in a situation where there is no mental health professionals who understands how I present as unwell and over the past 2 years or so I have constantly been dismissed and in 2013 this resulted in my ending up section again, although I spent 6 day asking for help to avoid this. (see my previous stories) My anxiety is around this situation arising again and having already been in a situation last year where no one in the team realised what was happening and they did not listen to my GP practice who would have been able to tell them.\n\nThe consultant also describes me as \u201copenly critical\u201d. My response to this is that I am allowed to have and to express opinions about the mental health services I receive. They told me they do not  have time to read my notes. This means I have formed the opinion that they are lazy and I will be critical of that. The consultant has also told me that my behaviour towards the team has been threatening because I had complained about a nurse. Given that they were  not present when that incident occurred I found that comment from them unprofessional. I do have a mind of my own and I will use it. I also think I am being more straight forward than the consultant is since I have told them to their face what I find difficult and object to. This gave an opportunity to put things right. That was the whole purpose of the appointment that this letter refers to as far as I was concerned. Yet still the consultant  refused any discussion.\n\n The consultant  writes that I hope my consultation has answered some of (my name) questions. I don't know how they have the nerve to write this when what they said when I asked the questions about my treatment that I raise earlier was that, I don't have to answer any of your questions because you have told me you want to change consultants therefore I am not your consultant any more and don't have answer any questions.  The consultant said this in the presence of my advocate who is prepared to back me up over this. Not only did I find this response immature and inappropriate it also left me in a situation where I did not actually know who was responsible for my care for a number of weeks. Although my advocate wrote to the manager to clarify this we did not get a response.\n\nThe consultant ends by asking my GP to reassure me that the intention is to help me and build trust. How can I trust someone who has manipulated my words in such a grotesque way and has consistently refused to discuss things with me face and face and who has chosen not to believe me when I truthfully told them about all the psychotic symptoms I had experienced as soon as I was well enough and had an appointment? The Consultant has consistently shown themself to be false and insincere and I have never felt able to trust them precisely because of all these things. I have never even felt able to attend an appointment alone because they write such inaccurate letters and also becomesvery angry during the consultations.\n\nI find the consultant attempting to dictate how my GP interacts with me further evidence of a controlling nature. My GP and I have had an extremely trusting relationship for nearly 20 years which is based on complete honestly from both of us. Our relationship has survived him sectioning me twice and on the second occasion we were able to shake hands on it. I really don't think we need any interference from anyone else with how we interact with one another. What we do need from a consultant is factual information on medication options etc.\n\nMy GP anyway did no such thing. What he did say was that it very good that I now have a consultant who has said HAIVNG READ MY NOTES that they do not doubt my diagnosis of bi polar and that this is what we need and it is also very good that this consultant is supportive of me increasing my medication myself because he understand the main thing is to prevent severe episodes of illness. \n\nMy GP went on to tell me that I do have a severe form of bi polar but the problem is that I present in an atypical way because I have taken such an active role in self management and have been doing this for so long, and that one of the reason for this situation is that standard treatment options have not worked for me. It is ironic that my self management skills have actually been disabling me over the past couple of year when dealing with practitioners who seem only able to recognise stereo typical presentations. I am hoping now that I will get the support I need to mange my severe and enduring mental illness from my new consultant who seemed perceptive and knowledgeable, as well as having an approachable manner. He also seems receptive to me being an expert patient.\n\nI have tried to raise the issue of this consultant making inaccurate records in a meeting with the clinical director. My advocate and I know from written documents regrading this compliant that this consultant has written that-She took time to answer my questions. This is not true, as I have made clear above. My advocate was present during this consultation and made her own notes. We will therefore be taking this complaint further, as the only response from the clinical director was that there may be difference of opinion. I am talking about facts that have inaccurately recorded.", "I was shuffled between wards 63-65 in Sept and again in October 2015.\nFantastic Doctors and Junior Doctors! Only too happy to help patients and put them out of pain... the trouble was some of the nurses reluctance to actually tell them patients were in agony. On numerous occasions I heard nurses tell patients they were not allowed any more pain relief.   Patients in the wards I was in (and sometimes concerned relatives) would query this and the nurses were in my opinion, at best rude and evasive.\nThere were patients (including myself with a life threatening condition) rocking on their beds, on the floors, wailing in pain and several of the nurses seemed unwilling to call a Doctor to write them up for more pain relief. I don't think this is the nurses call!\nI was put in and left in a toilet cubicle so I didn't distress the visitors with my pain. Another patient later found me passed out from the pain on the toilet floor (disgusting) and alerted another nurse from another ward. Only at this point a Doctor was called - they were only too happy to help and gave me morphine.\nThis was not an isolated incident! When the Doctors arrived they shyly apologised for leaving us in that pain for that length of time but there was nothing they could do. The Doctors told me they don't manage the nurses.\nMany of the nurses were lovely but there were numerous dismissive nurses making decisions that I think they were simply not qualified to make.\nThe Enhanced Recovery Ward was good.\nThe other issue is the \"hand over\" meetings. The nurses in these wards are not to be disturbed during these meetings. Your agony just has to wait. Auxiliary nurses took it upon themselves to tell you you'd need to wait until the handover was finished to get a nurse to ask for morphine. They couldn't even pass the message on for you! This was something again, doctors apologised for in private.\nYou wouldn't leave someone in the pain they left me and many others in (sometimes for hours). I just don't understand it.\nApparently the bedding is only changed in ward 64 if the bedding looks grubby. Other than that its changed on a Sunday and/or Wednesday.\nThis needs to stop. As a normally perfectly able bodied young person I've never felt so humiliated and unsafe in all my life.", "Dear 22kk88ss,\r\nThere are many aspects of this which concern me greatly and I would like to be able to look into this further, as immediately as possible.\r\nCould you please contact me directly on lorna.gray@ggc.scot.nhs.uk as soon as you can?\r\nMany thanks,\r\nLorna", "It is deplorable that when male catheterisations are done in hospital they are done (I understand) by a male nurse or a doctor but in the community they are done by district nurses.\n\nVirtually every catheter change in my father has resulted in an infection which in turn has caused hallucinations - very distressing for him and for those watching. \n\nCatheter changes in hospital are covered by Gentamicin but in the community there is no automatic antibiotic cover. He has required hospitalisation 4 times in the last two years i feel as a direct result of the inability of the district nurses to do their job.\n\nSupra-pubic catheter: exactly 2 years ago when my father was admitted as an emergency for the first time and it was said that he would be discharged with a catheter I asked if it might be possible for him to have one. The suggestion was summarily dismissed by the consultant. In the subsequent admissions to hospital the suggestion was met with increasing acceptance but of course it has to be done as a planned procedure (MORE cost) and cannot be done as part of an in-patient stay. Now, he wouldn't agree to go in for the procedure even if it was offered.\n\nSo - the story of the last forty eight hours:\nOver the last 2 years my 95 year old father has had to endure perhaps 8-10 catheter changes and, of those, I think 4 have resulted in hospitalisation because the district nurses either couldn't do it or caused so much trauma and bleeding that he required further help. This is completely unacceptable, putting to one side the issue of a supra-pubic catheter which would have negated most of the issues, if we are first to do no harm then district nurses need to be trained to an exceptional level.\n\nWhen he goes to hospital, he uses up precious NHS resources. Earlier this week, after the district nurses had arrived and tried unsuccessfully to change the catheter around 11 am, my father was in pain and distress until he got to the Western and had his catheter changed around half past midnight. He was in retention and, when scanned, had 500mls of urine in his bladder. He had to be kept overnight to make sure all was well. So that was 3 visits by district nurses during the day, calls to NHS 24 where an on call doctor ok'd his hospitalisation. The \u201c2 hour ambulance\u201d did not arrive within the specified time, and, due to his deteriorating condition, a 999 ambulance was requested. This took 30 minutes to arrive. A bed in Acute Receiving, then a bed in ward 27, then a ward round then patient transport back to the care home. ALL AVOIDABLE COSTS.\n\nNo ward round was forthcoming on the day after his arrival and I managed to persuade the nurse that taking further bloods was not helpful. Just stop! The question that must be asked in each and every situation is: for whose benefit are we doing this?  Certainly not my fathers in this instance.\n\nThe complete fiasco of his discharge deserves a post all of its own! The large catheter was changed for a smaller one and he was sent to the discharge lounge. I phoned at 5pm and the receptionist couldn't find him on the system so went to look for him. He wasn't in the lounge so the nurse told me he had gone. I phoned the care home and he hadn't arrived so we assumed he was en route. Two hours later there was no sign of him and it turned out they hadn't got him to the lounge in time for his slot so the transport had gone! They took him back up to ward and sat him in the nurses station plying him with cups of tea until they had to send him home in a taxi with an escort who I believe was doing it out of the goodness of their heart and in their own time! Patient Transport needs to sort itself out.\n\nMy father is 95, has stage 3 kidney failure, severe fluid retention, atrial fibrillation, possible prostate cancer, suspected bowel cancer, mild dementia and lost his wife of 66 years in February. He lives in a care home and has no interest in engaging in anything - he doesn't want to be here, and he is very very scared of being in hospital.\n\nAs a matter of urgency can whoever reads this and has responsibility for district nurses who are allegedly qualified to change male catheters take immediate action to ensure that training is put in place to rectify this appalling situation. My father cannot be the only one who is suffering like this and it has to stop.\n\nI have nothing but praise for the team that sorted him out within half an hour of arriving at the Western - absolutely fantastic and seemingly so simple for them to accomplish.\n\n Perhaps district nurses could attend Acute Receiving on a regular basis and learn how to do this procedure and thereby save the NHS a significant amount of money and their patients a great deal of distress.", "Good morning bordersgirl57  \r\nI am very sorry to hear about the distress caused to your father, particularly over the last 48 hours.

However I demanded an X ray.\nAfter the xray I was told every thing looked fine to bring him back to fracture clinic on Monday. This was a (Saturday). On the Monday I took him back to fracture clinic where he was asleep in his pushchair. I was told by the doctor there was nothing wrong with him and he insisted I didn't wake him up however he happened to just move my son's arm and he stored in pain crying out Mummy! The Doctor Then Proceeded to Tell the nursing assistant to give me a cuff and sling and send me on my way. However they didn't even have one of those to fit him. The nursing assistant I guess could see I was furious and asked was I not happy I told her straight I wasn't so she said we'll this is your baby go back in and tell him! I did this but it fell on deaf ears! On leaving the hospital I was so furious and upset knowing there was something wrong with my child I took him straight to MRI for a second opinion. They emailed NMGH for my son's xrays which was looked at by 2 doctors I was then called to look at the xray myself and to my horror was told My son had actual broken his elbow.

All seemed to be progressing normally and I had elected for an epidural. I was apprehensive about this birth as the birth of my first child was traumatic; as she was a forceps delivery after becoming distressed. So In my mind, an epidural for pain relief seemed the better option. My first epidural did not properly take effect so I was given a second epi/spinal combination which completely seemed to stop my contractions and unfortunately I had to go to theatre for another forceps delivery.\nMy baby was born just before 4pm, and all seemed to be ok. I was admitted to Ward 68 and due to the spinal and surgery I had a urinary catheter in place.\nThe next day (Sunday) I had my catheter removed and was asked to measure my urine output and drink plenty. I did this and was told I was retaining urine, so the catheter had to go back in overnight.  On the Monday , the catheter was once again removed, I was told to drink plenty and measure my urine output and was told if I retained too much it would need to be put back in for 48hours. Later that day, I was scanned with a handheld scanner and an in/out catheter was used. I was told once again, that I was retaining too much urine and had to have the catheter back in for 24-48hours.\nThe catheter was put back in (this was now my third in total excluding the in/out) and I was kept over night again. On the Tuesday a doctor attended the bedside and told me they were removing the catheter again, and if I could urinate normally I would go home around 4 or 5 pm. Once again, the catheter was removed. The staff on duty brought me jugs and jugs of water (I believe from 11am-5pm I drank approximately 3 litres of water) and I was urinating plenty and frequently. It was indicated that I would be able to leave. My husband came to the hospital at 4pm to wait. I had my discharge talk, my papers were in order but we waited until 10. 30pm when another doctor came, who had been told by a 3rd doctor I had not seen, that I could not leave. The catheter had to be put back in.\nThis was outrageous to me, as I had been sitting since 11am expecting to get home, my husband had been waiting for 6 hours, I had already been in hospital for 4 days with no explanation as to why I had to be catheterised. When I asked the doctor what the reasons were, I was told simply I was retaining urine. There was no explanation as to what caused the problem or why. I was told repeatedly I was too young to have a permanent bladder issue and that if I checked out they couldn't fix the problem.\nI was upset, as was my husband. The midwife on duty (a wonderful lady who I cannot fault at all) came back with the doctor, my bladder was scanned, an indwelling catheter was put in. I was advised by the midwife that protocol was if I was retaining water the catheter stay in 24-48hours and if after that time period, I was still retaining water, the catheter would stay in for a week. This again upset me greatly mostly because I didn't understand why and most importantly, why had the doctor taken the decision to remove the catheter if it needed to be in for at least a full 24 hours?\nOn the Wednesday, I was visited by yet another doctor whose name I cannot remember, but he tried to reassure me and tried to explain what was wrong but said that he was not a specialist and that he would be getting a uro-gynaecologist to contact me to arrange an appointment. He felt I should have gone home the day before, with the catheter and to come back to learn to self catheterise.\nI was discharged on the Wednesday. I was meant to receive a call from the urologist on the Thursday. I did not. I called back to ward 68 and informed them. I then received a call from a uro-gynaecologist at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital who had a cancellation for the Friday morning.\nI attended this appointment, had the indwelling catheter removed, was taught to self catheterise and a plan was put in place for bladder recovery. I was very emotional and spoke frankly with the urologist about the fiasco at the maternity hospital. I spoke about how much I had been drinking, the time limits placed on me to urinate and the doctor was adamant that I should have been advised to drink 2 litres in any day or a glass per hour would have been sufficient. So being brought jugs and jugs of water to drink was not in any way necessary or helpful. The water had to go somewhere and if I was having trouble urinating what was to be expected?\nI have been advised that I will self catheterise for an indeterminate time.\nMy complaint really focuses on the following points:\n\u2022 Why was I attended by several doctors all advising different things? Surely the treatment and care I received should have been consistent to ensure a quick recovery? The constant in/out of five catheters in a five day period was excessive.\n\u2022 On the Tuesday, why did my husband and I have to wait until 10. 30pm to be told I could not go home? Why was there no clear explanation of my problem? Even when I asked what exactly was wrong I was told simply that sometimes the bladder goes in a wee huff! This is not acceptable!\n\u2022 Why was I encouraged to drink far beyond the recommended amounts and expected to urinate as much as that in a time limit? Why was there a lack of knowledge about this in particular with certain members of staff?\n\u2022 Why was I discharged without having seen a urologist before leaving the hospital? Surely it would have been ideal to have that all taken care of before leaving rather than being referred to another hospital?\n\u2022 Why was protocol not followed regarding the initial 24-48hour catheterisation and again, not followed when I was told to keep it in for a week?\nHow can anyone confidently say that I received the best standard of care when certain protocols were not followed? How can anyone confidently say that the constant insertion and removal of catheters may have delayed my recovery, or the care I received may have adversely affected the condition? With doctors were over-ruling each other and not communicating (clearly there was a lack of communication or I would have been left alone a bit longer? )? And when I and my husband were left sitting for 6 and a half hours before being told I had to stay in the hospital.\nOn returning home from the hospital, I cried for three days. This experience has completely ruined this experience for me. I cannot enjoy my newborn baby as I have to constantly measure my urine and catheterise four times a day. My community midwife was very supportive as was my health visitor but it is a bit late when clearly I needed that support and care in the ward from senior staff members. I actually do not want to have another child or add to my family anymore because of this experience.\nIt is unfathomable that I could have two traumatic birth experiences in the same hospital but there we are. It happened and someone needs to take responsibility for these recent events. I felt completely ignored, I feel the buck was passed, I was told frequently how short staffed the ward was but also had no information regarding the problems I was experiencing.", "My time on the Acute Assessment Unit at the Cavell Centre was a horrendous experience. I won't go into the full details as I am too scared that I'll be identified and subjected to negative criticism or abuse or this being blamed on my mental illness. I have had several admissions to this ward in the past and each time I've found some of staff to be really cold and unapproachable, some lack total empathy, compassion and understanding whilst others do not seem to want to listen or acknowledge, there have been times when I felt like a prisoner, trapped in a place where you would think you'd be in a place of safety and respite but it's only when you're given a lovely warm welcome and than you really start to feel the deception and ignorance after a couple of days of stay here and realise that all isn't as it seems.\n\nThis last admission was horrific and all I can say is if asking for help and being brushed off wasn't bad enough than how would it feel to end up curled up on the floor crying to just be left and ignored? I still can't to this day understand what I did wrong? I hardly came out of my room after that and was too traumatized, too scared to call anybody or go out there and ask for help.\n\nEven though I was feeling very depressed and anxious, it felt like none of them took me seriously enough, literally I was in my bedroom just staring in to space, couldn't sleep well, didn't feel like eating, didn't want to live, just kept praying that something terrible would happen to me, like die of a heart attack because I'm pretty sure the staff wouldn't of cared, let alone have taken a blind notice. If dealing with the mental pain couldn't be any worse than actually feeling like you were dying from it, honestly, can someone please just tell me how far do you have go to get a little attention? how more expressive do you have to get before it just looks like someone who's an attention-seeker? I didn't kill myself but tried to, and they probably saw it why? Because that is how FAR you have to get to actually be taken seriously and heard but even that tactic doesn't work with them because it's AAU and you're not suppose to harm yourself or make threats.\n\nIt's hard having to live with any condition but when you have a mental health problem, the saddest part is than there leaves a big opportunity for some medical professionals to either take advantage or use it against you like when you come into hospital and suddenly all the freedom, choices, personal rights and control is taken away from you....Ok I get there are rules but that doesn't mean it gives them the right to treat people unfairly or differently because of their diagnosis or situation they've come into hospital for.\n\nOne incident during the first or second day and I remember it just as clear, I came out of my room during the night, figuring that night time was less busy and I'd be more likely to be listened to, since for starters none of the patients were around and it was very quiet, so I went to the nurses station and asked for some help, a nurse walked out and she told me to sit down on one the lounge chairs so that's what I did, then she walks across to another room because I believe another staff member may have heard something going on, minutes later the same nurse comes out of the room and without any understandable reason or tact she told me -can you go back to your room as you'll disturb the others- so there is me thinking \"well I must have deserved that because obviously nobody wants to help me since I'm such a burden to everyone.  It made me feel even more worthless and awful and like I mentioned earlier, it was probably one of the things that stopped me leaving my room as much for the rest of the stay.\n\nOn the day of discharge I saw the Psychiatrist and by than I was just feeling completely weak and tired, even doctors can be cold-hearted or show very little emotion, he asked me several questions to which I didn't know many of the answers for, as there was so much I also wanted to talk about, my mind went simply blank and to him it may have looked like another one of my \"tactics\" It's actually quite interesting when you sit just a few metres away and they seem to imagine or know everything about you but not necessarily coming across as being focused or that interested with what is really going on inside your head other than analysing everything you say as mere meaningless talk that isnt of any true significance to how you are really feeling.\n\nI asked the Psychiatrist to look into something that might help me and it honestly felt they would really follow up on that suggestion but I am still here, waiting and haven't heard anything more on it.   \n\nSince being discharged from AAU the experience I had there has left me deeply traumatized, angry and feeling even more alone and isolated with the condition. I no longer trust psychiatrists or mental health professionals and I'll never go back to that unit if I have another relapse as I feel too frightened and let down by the whole system in general\" \n \nI just hope with time my condition will improve and be able to go out again, find inner confidence, peace and get my life back, which feels like it has been taken away from me but at the moment it's really difficult because if I talk it never feels right and whatever I say or do it is blamed all on my diagnosis...It's like I'm not allowed to be a real human being and have any real emotions, therefore my feelings don't count or are just fabrications and I'd rather just keep them bottled in now and stay away from people so I don't get hurt again but what is quite obvious is that I'm basically all alone with this for the long haul.", "Dear harleyquinn1985,\r\nFirst of all, congratulations on the birth of your new baby.

It was only after she started to become very ill, that medoc our out of hours doctors, got involved, a wonderful female doctor stayed for over 2 hour's at our home, refusing to leave my wife as she was really concerned that my wife's airways were slowly closing along with the worry that septicaemia was setting in, the doc argued with medway maritime hospital all the time she was with us that unless they referred my wife to QVH that she wasn't leaving my wife until they done just that ano if anything happened to her that the doctor would be taking her own actions against medway maritime hospital, especially as my wife had been turned away from them time after time. \n\nThankfully the doc got what she wanted and my wife was seen the following morning by Mr Norris and he's team at the QV EAST GRINSTEAD, Mr Norris was the doctor on duty at the time. As soon as he saw my wife he had her admitted and I cannot thank Dr Norris and he's team and all the staff at QV enough. My wife was put on intravenous antibiotics and underwent an emergency op to cut all the infection away along with removing her back bottom teeth. My wife is terrified of a general anthestic due to bad past experience and no doubt caused much stress to the team at QV. Yet everyone was absolutely fantastic with her and very patient, in fact Dr Norris and all the staff were just amazing and I really can't thank them enough. I have no doubt that Dr Norris and he's team saved my wife's life and I thank each and everyone of them for that. \n\nThe QV at East Grinstead is a wonderful hospital, the staff very professional at all times yet also very caring and they explained everything that was happening very clearly at every stage. The QV at East Grinstead is definitely a leading example to how all hospitals should be run no matter how large or small because they really are a wonderful hospital with a wonderful team of highly professional Dr's and nurse's along with all the other staff so Thank you so much to Dr Norris and he's team and just thank you to everyone at the QV hospital, you really are such a fantastic, highly professional and very caring team of Dr's and nurse's right down to the reception staff and even the cleaner's, just a wonderful hospital with wonderful staff and Dr's. \n\nSadly a year later my wife is suffering again at the hands of medway, no one wanting to know and constantly on antibiotics that are failing so I just hope that one of the Dr's here in medway will be so quick to get my wife referred to the QV for their specialist care again because this time the antibiotics are not working at all so of course the infection is just progressing very fast.\n\n I also know that my wife is becoming more poorly as the day's progress and now her airways are suffering yet still every Dr, Dentist along with medway maritime hospital just keep saying, it's not their responsibility. ..well whose responsibility is it? Just disgusting treatment in medway and now I can only hope that some decent Dr actually refers my wife back to the QV hospital where I know they will do everything to help my wife.\n\nThank God for the staff and Dr's at the QV hospital East Grinstead. The Dr's and all the staff at QV East Grinstead deserve a medal for all of their hard work and dedication and just for being human too. Such a wonderful and very clean hospital too, QV you really are the Gem in the NHS. ....thank you so much.", "Dear Chocolates,\r\nThank you for your feedback.

I think I may have got over it better if I had not been left in pain and discomfort since, I have had endless tests but nothing can be found but I feel I have sustained scar tissue inside as if I've been burnt and the scar tissue is pulling on nerves inside.  \r\nI have just had to learn to live with it but it has changed my life for the worse, I had bi polar electro surgery and have since discovered that some have been used on a too high setting in BWH. It is a barbaric procedure and should be looked into.  \r\nI have given birth to 2 children so am in no way a baby, but I think this procedure is putting women through unnecessary suffering.", "Thank you for your response and your offer to help our service to improve.

CAMHS were no help because there was no confidentiality between me and the psychologist. She would tell everything to my mum even details where there was no risk of harm. In the end I discharged myself because I was told I had to have family therapy when they were aware I couldn't talk in front of my mum.\nMy next contact with mental health services were the crisis team when I was at a very low point. Some of the staff were extremely helpful however others weren't. One particular nurse was very helpful in supporting me through it all and getting me back on track.\nI was referred to the crisis team over a year after this and was met by 2 very unhelpful members of staff who told me I only had low self-esteem. I've since been diagnosed with a personality disorder and I had the same signs when I saw the crisis team.\nI had to go to my GP dozens of times to finally be referred to cmht. This was when I saw a psychiatrist who figured out my diagnosis and sorted my meds and out and referred me to a cpn. So I was really pleased with this.\nThe cpn I see is extremely helpful and I trust them a lot.\nHowever recently when my cpn has been off sick I've been in crisis and tried to get in touch with someone else to be told by the duty worker to have a cup of tea, have a bath or go for a walk. Something impossible to distract me from my thoughts when I'm so severe. I need support when my cpn is off sick.\nCrisis team were also contacted again and was told I would hear back from the duty worker, I never did.\nSomething needs sorting in the service where professionals actually communicate with each other and offer effective support like coming to see you and chat things through rather than just telling you to have a cup of tea. A cup of tea doesn't solve suicidal thoughts.", "Thank you for taking the time to post your comments. We are so sorry to hear about your experience and that your felt let down by our service. We are disappointed as your experience does not reflect our Trust values, where we pride ourselves on our professionalism and communication skills.  \r\nWe value all comments as it helps us to continuously improve our service. Unfortunately in your experience you weren't offered any pain relief and for this I apologise. Due to this being two years ago, I can confirm that our practice has developed. We have now implemented into our routine practice a variety of pain relief. We have also opened a recovery area with recliner chairs and refreshments for patients to use post procedure. We have received positive feedback for this facility.  \r\nTo ensure our patients receive the best possible care, we regularly audit our work and a recent randomised trial was carried out in our department looked at polyp removal in the outpatient setting. The results showed, it was far safer to have the procedure carried out as an outpatient than having a general anaesthetic and was the preferred setting of over 80% of patients. A further trial looking at polyp removal, demonstrated the Hysteroscopic Morcellator to be associated with less pain and more acceptable in the outpatient setting than electrical resection and therefore, we have introduced this modality.  \r\nWe are committed to improve our patient experience and therefore we appreciate you bringing this to our attention.

We take all feedback we receive extremely seriously. I am sorry to hear about some of the difficulties you feel you have had in the past. If you were open to our community team, you should have received a call back. You have described this very well, and we will make sure the team is aware of your concerns.\r\nI would only add that any advice we offer is not given lightly. We know people often call the crisis team in a very distressed state and, after a calming conversation with the service, the next step that will work best for the caller is to take some time to try to relax. We know advice to make a cup of tea doesn't solve suicidal thoughts by itself. But our experience is that this can be great advice for some people who just cannot see a way out of the difficulty they see for themselves. Often making a cup of tea means they can take a little time to consider what they are facing, and that can actually help a great deal.

Our relative also suffered from other health conditions. After an acute phase in the main hospital our relative was transferred to the Larkfield Unit for rehabilitation. The care our relative received there was very poor, After an inpatient stay of approx six weeks unfortunately our relative passed away. This was not altogether unexpected. We did voice our concerns to nursing staff when issues occurred at the time.  One of the doctors in charge we felt really was not interested in speaking/helping us, however we were very concerned with so many aspects of the care that we requested a copy of the case notes.\n\nWithout going into detail we had major issues with personal care (no bath/shower given to patient for the full 5 weeks of his inpatient stay),\n\noral hygiene was neglected -teeth were obviously not cleaned on a regular basis.\n\nAfter referring to the case notes we also noted pressure sore chart completed incorrectly.\n\nnutrition- first seen by dietitian 14 days after being admitted to the unit- weight loss during the inpatient stay was greater than 10% in a short space of time. Our relative was not eating/drinking enough.  We feel that  staff, were aware but Did not escalate the problem, however recorded it in the  notes regularly with no action. \n\nA  Dieteticn review recommended a prescription of high energy drinks- this instruction was ignored for three weeks despite being recorded in the clinical notes and nursing notes and was only rectified when the dietician realised the mistake .As a family we were unaware of this major error at the time. This error in our opinion definitely hastened death. Despite major weight loss and poor oral intake nobody bothered to implement the instruction  to commence  drinks and they were not prescribed. We believe this would have given an extra 500calories per day.  \n\nFluid balance charts / food charts were completed to such a low standard it was embarrassing. No evidence of any senior nurse \"signing off\" these \u201c complete\u201d  charts.\n\nMedicine administration-often as relatives we found tablets on the bedside table not ingested, however they had been signed as given by the nursing staff. Patient was   also severely dehydrated however a diuretic continued to be offered and no review of my relatives medication appeared to take place. Also, digoxin levels were not taken..\n\nObservation charts- near end of life - mews scored as 4 (which means four hourly obs-) was checked at 17.20 .  next checked 34 hours later! ! ) unacceptable.\n\nDeath certificate- delay of 36 hours to obtain said document, and then no cause of death was entered. This caused more distress and delay when registering the death.\n\nThis summary is very brief, and we had many more issues.\nOur first letter of complaint was submitted to Greater Glasgow and Clyde and acknowledged in early June 15( before we had reference to the case notes). The reply (mid August 15) (delayed and in breach of the guidelines) acknowledged some of the poor standards of care. After receiving and reading the notes I was appalled by the extremely poor level of documentation spanning the complete length of his inpatient stay. \n\nI was so concerned I really believe that it constituted basic institutional neglect that we submitted a further letter of complaint which lead to a face to face meeting with a panel of representatives from the hospital in October where they agreed that poor care was delivered.

He is at risk of leg amputation if the antibiotics fail. \n\"Rang the hospital today. They said he was likely to be discharged tomorrow. I asked if the infection had gone and they said he would be on antibiotics. I rang [home care provider] and they said they did not 'do' discharges over the week end. I explained that he had no food and I would not be there (She is visiting another family member). They said the hospital would have to make arrangements. I rang the hospital back and they said they did not have the beds. I said there was a possibility he would need reminding every day to take the antibiotics. they said that was outside their remit or words to that effect. Then his carer rang (the one that does most of the work). She said she had left [provider]. She offered to go over to his tomorrow and make sure he had food. I will ring the hospital to see if he is definitely being discharged.

Was urgently admitted to Forth Valley Royal CAU the following day with query sepsis, staff advised I could have died.", "My experience of Bolton Royal Infirmary has been absolutely appalling overall.  \r\nNever before in my life have I encountered such poor service. I speak for me and my partner, both our lives have been considerably affected by this hospitals poor service.  \r\nI'm still struggling to recover and had to move to Newcastle to receive any decent care. I have lost job, accommodation and several years of my life have been spent in agony - and I'm in my late 20s. I'm generally very polite and never complained about the hours of waiting, etc and nor rude under any appointment, sadly I wasn't treated likewise.  \r\n2 years ago I ended up with serious eye problems and in tremendous pain, my GP referred me to Bolton Royal Infirmary. We were introduced to the unbelievably rude receptionists, but the ophthalmologist was all right the first time. They wrote down a range of conditions it could be (blepharitis, allergies, etc) and put me on antibiotics, it didn't cure the problem.  \r\nAfter there I was seen by another who was beyond arrogant and incompetent, who insisted that I just had blepharitis and I objected to this as the symptoms did not match up with any of the pain and symptoms I felt. At this point I couldn't even wear glasses on one eye due to pain in the eye socket, so was forced to wear one contact lens to get by. Their response was to give me a leaflet on blepharitis told me where the door was, no further explanation than a name of a condition, no follow up just discharged with severe pain and visual symptoms.  \r\nMy condition kept getting worse and I ended up in A&E several times with severe infections, etc. I had to give my job up as software developer, etc. My GP was getting frustrated with the hospital too, writing strong letters on how bad the condition was. The hospital replied by giving me a new appointment in 4-5 months time. At this point, the company I worked for stepped in and said enough, they wanted me back and decided to pay for private consultation at Manchester Hospital. Here they actually did something, a schrimers test showed I had 1-2mm tears in my eyes, where 15+ is normal, further investigating showed I had \"gross\" giant papillary conjunctivitis in both eyelids. They couldn't say what was causing the pain in my eye socket in one eye though. My condition at this point was so bad I couldn't work again and had to go live with my gfs parent.  \r\nIt has taken 2 years on the strongest steroids to calm the GPC and inflammation in my eyes and it is not fully gone. I have developed severe reactions to any irritants, like fumes and can't go to town anymore. I now use punctual plugs and a Professor at Newcastle Eye is personally dealing with my case, trying to help me recover after Bolton's failure. Hopefully it isn't too late for me to recover.  \r\nFurthermore, the NHS choices had to reject this review on their site as the NHS complaint it was too \"old\", we are talking 2 years here and the review wasn't posted until 2 years in as I been suffering so severely from their mistakes that I didn't feel well enough to actually write the review.  \r\nBottom line, I wish I had used another hospital and not Bolton Royal Infirmary.", "Dear Stuart21\r\nThank you for taking the time to tell your story.

I suffer from Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and subsequently have mental health problems. In recent years I have repeatedly had to attend A&E to be stitched up etc. Recently I have been trying very hard not to self harm and have been accessing therapy and support and hadn't been to the department for quite a while.  \r\nWhen I got there the streaming nurse recognised me and said how well I have been doing and she had noticed that I haven't been for a while. She was very caring and supportive. I really hate going to A&E. I call it 'The walk of shame' as I know my wounds are self inflicted.  \r\nEarlier this morning I had had a nightmare and flashback and had woken up yet again with a wet bed, crying and shaking and so frightened. When I am in this state I disassociate and today I found myself in the bathroom and had stabbed myself in the chest.  \r\nI knew I needed medical attention and stitches so I reluctantly went to A&E.  \r\nThe streaming nurse took my hand and led me into the resus section of A&E as the stab wound in my chest was deep.  \r\nWhen I walked in I felt so upset and frightened and it is really loud and busy. The doctor, called Chris, recognised me. He sat me on a bed and the nurse bought a gown and blanket. He coldly said that he won't need them. He briefly looked at my wound. Didn't ask me many questions but did ask if I wanted pain relief which I said I did. He never gave me any but made me feel like I deserved the pain I was in. He bought a kit over and coldly stitched my wound and then said he would get DPM to see me. He put on a plaster that I am allergic to but I didn't have the courage to say anything.  \r\nAt 4. 30 he left me curled under my coat, cold and upset and never spoke to me again.  \r\nI cried and felt so lost and pathetic. I hate it when I hurt myself and never want to be at the hospital.  \r\nLater on they put me in a different area of the department and I laid there for 3 hours on my own. When the new staff came on a male nurse put a blanket over me and that made me cry more as I didn't feel I deserved any act of kindness.  \r\nI was wheeled into the other side of A&E and placed in the middle of the department on a trolley. I cried even more and was in pain.  \r\nAt 9am I finally saw a man from DPM. He told me to go home and to call my MHT tomorrow. I told him how frightened I was about hurting myself and that I was in pain. I asked for one tablet for tonight so I had something to calm me down but he told me I had to ring 111 and he couldn't help me.  \r\nI left the department at 9. 30, really upset. I had to sit in my car in the car park and ring 111 to ask NEMS to call me. I sat in my car for nearly an hour and a GP rang me back and luckily gave me a prescription for one tablet of lorazepam so I can be safer tonight. I picked up the prescription on my way home from hospital.  \r\nI know that I self harm and can understand the judgement that professionals make but I was treated really coldly and in an uncaring way. It just compounds the thoughts that I have that I am dirty, stupid and disgusting. No one cared that I was upset, cold, in pain and alone and I got the impression that they think if they treat me like that I won't do it again but unfortunately mental health doesn't work like that and I don't have a lot of control. I am waiting for in patient trauma therapy and am happy to engage in any way it can in order to get better.  \r\nThe New Year is the anniversary of a major traumatic event and is a hard time for me. I have had very little sleep, too many flashbacks and nightmares and feel very suicidal and low. Last nights care has just made me feel worse and the worrying thing is that I'm not sure I will ever go back but what do I do when I need urgent care. It frightens me that I will kill myself.  \r\nI would hate anyone to be treated like I was last night. I have never complained before and am so appreciative of the support I receive. This time, however I want an explanation as to why I was treated so badly and in such an uncaring manner.

The phisio made me an appointment with the doctor who performed the surgery. After 4 month waiting for the appointment I was sent to another doctor. When I explained to him I was still in considerable pain, he got involved and did the rotator cuff test and took some xrays. After viewing xrays, he commented that he thought his colleague had made a terrible mistake and sent me for a further mri scan.  \r\nAfter a further 4 month wait to see a new surgeon, I had sent for my medical records before I was due for the appointment so I knew the 2nd Mri scan showed I still had rotator cuff tears, but the surgeon tried to convince me that the 2nd mri scan was also unreliable that indeed my cuff was intact.  \r\nAfter 3rd opinion it was confirmed that indeed the 2 mri scans were 100% accurate, but it was too late to fix the tears now as arthritis had set in, and I'm now waiting on a shoulder transplant.", "During my wives numerous admittance via A@E to Crosshouse hospital during the period 20014 to date, we have felt that they have consistently failed to address our concerns. At one point we were told by a doctor that we had to stop relying on them to help resolve our issues.  \r\nEvery issue raised is backed up by medical records, which we feel point to the lack of competence shown by the consultants tasked with my wife's complex medical requirements, due to a rare form of cancer and resulting treatment.  \r\nWhen attempting to challenge poor decisions we were completely fobbed of with various speeches designed to make us believe that it was us that had the problem and that the surgical team were doing their best to provide the best possible care for her ongoing medical needs.  \r\nIt was a recent admission to Ayr A@E that further evidence of the poor care we feel my wife has suffered at the hands of the surgical team at Crosshouse came to light.

A drug test which my daughter consented to taking came up positive for opiates after eating poppy seed bread. Our family and particularly my pregnant daughter were put through complete and utter hell.  \r\nIt was claimed the only thing that could have caused a positive opiate test, other than illegal drugs was codeine. Ironically my daughter had been prescribed codeine for a painful condition she was suffering from at the time but hadn't taken it as she was worried about the effect on her unborn baby. She made the mistake of being honest by saying she hadn't taken the codeine. She genuinely had no idea what had caused the positive drug test. She was treated in the most disgusting way.  \r\nWe had to fight and do our own research to prevent my grandson being removed from my daughter at birth. We discovered it was the bread and that there was a test that would prove it wasn't heroin. We were told by one staff member that there wasn't. When we insisted and involved other medics the test was done. The same staff member lied and said the result proved it was heroin. We knew it wasn't so contacted the toxicology department ourselves. They confirmed it wasn't heroin, well we knew that. Both morphine and poppy seeds have exactly the same chemical make up and that was what the test came up positive for.  \r\nThis same staff member then insisted my daughter was a morphine addict. This person just wouldn't accept that she wasn't a drug user, even though she was clearly the picture of good health. I have never experienced anything like it! Obviously my daughter had stopped eating the bread so the drug tests were now coming back negative. This staff member then accused her of using someone else's urine for the test! We then had to insist a nurse supervised my daughter taking the test.  \r\nStill they were insisting my daughter's baby would be removed at birth and placed in intensive care. At one point I had to argue with 4 different doctors. When I threatened to go to the papers they relented. When my perfectly healthy grandson was born and turned out not to be a heroin addict, we didn't even get an apology. After stress that I can't even describe!", "We're sorry to hear that you were unhappy with your daughter's treatment at our hospital. We issued a full response to your complaint in our letter dated 2 September 2014. If you would like to discuss your outstanding concerns and your options under the NHS Complaints Procedure, Stephen Evans, head of complaints & PALS, would be very happy to talk to you. You can reach him on 020 7794 0500 extension 38263.", "My baby was sent to hospital at five days old due to losing just too much weight from birth. This was due to my breasts being too engorged for his poor little mouth to be able to feed properly. It was discussed with midwife to express and feed, however the hospital would want to see him due to protocol-no problem.  \r\nSo we went in, and they agreed with the feeding agreement. The registrar, who was lovely, said they would keep him in, as his sodium levels were a tad high, but we would be home the next day as long as they fell.  \r\nUpon arriving, we were put into a disused ward which was the dump for broken beds, and left. A couple of doctors came to examine him. One took heel prick bloods, twice as the first was not enough, and the other who weighed and measured him and allowed him to pee on his umbilical stump.  \r\nHowever the next day another doctor examined him, and while doing so noticed the umbilical stump smelled a bit. This is expected with necrotising tissue as far as I'm aware, and I explained a colleague of hers had let him pee on it. Well all hell broke loose. She took swabs which apparently showed growth (again I'd expect that with dead tissue) and wished to start him on antibiotics which they fitted a canula for. The canula was fitted and blood was taken, for the doctor (another from the morning rounds) to then say it was no use for the antibiotics and he had to fit another one. My poor boy was beside himself at this stage, never mind me.  \r\nA doctor then appeared in our room to say they had to carry out a lumbar puncture then disappeared. Well my husband and I fell apart. What made them think he had meningitis, he had no symptoms, it hadn't been mentioned until now. So they took him for that, which I could not face so his dad went with him. I am informed that this procedure was attempted twice as the doctor missed the first time. His hand was shaking throughout the procedure, and my husband was not allowed to be near our son to try and help comfort him during it.  \r\nAnyway, turns out they did not think he had meningitis, this is a routine test done on all babies who come in on the off chance an infection may have spread. Now we have since researched and every meningitis strain can be detected in blood tests, and guidelines are for lumbar punctures to be a last resort due to the invasiveness of the procedure. I might add that no one had written permission to carry this out, as would be required of an adult.  \r\nSo we then spent 6 days in hospital, being given no information by any of the ridiculous amount of doctors we saw. We had to put our son on formula as I was receiving very little sometimes no water, and in the whole week received enough food for a day and a half at home, yet they support breastfeeding mums!  \r\nMy son became quite bad at throwing milk up after a feed, new to us as he had not been on formula. I worried this may be due to the antibiotics etc so asked advice from a nurse, to be given no assistance to alleviate my worry, only to then overhear her complaining about us worrying and daring to ask questions pertaining to the welfare of our son.  \r\nThe antibiotics would be administered which would wake our baby up, and they hurt and scared him, for him to be left screaming by the staff. On the few occasions my husband and I left the ward, we would return to a screaming baby, who hadn't been looked at, yet the information I have read and re read states a newborn baby should be attended to within 30 seconds of starting. I have rambled enough and still not covered everything.  \r\nQuite frankly, I feel they carried out procedures on my baby, for no reason. The worst was that him being so young, we did not even know him well enough to be able to comfort him during all these nasty unnecessary procedures. I felt far from supported as a breastfeeding mother, which I may add never came back enough that I could feed my son and he is now formula fed due to this.  \r\nWe were told twice during the stay that we weren't to have him out of his cot. Someone trying to tell me I can't cuddle my son?! I think not! So much for bonding as much as possible, and skin to skin etc required to assist breastfeeding.  \r\nNo one in his week in hospital thought to check his tongue, considering he was in for weight loss/feeding issues. Upon our return home our doctor noticed he was tongue tied, which was not too bad but improved feeding instantly. However it was too late by then, I was not producing enough milk and my supply would not increase quickly enough to support him, hence his now having to be fed formula at cost to us.  \r\nOur experience of this hospital was a shambles I won't take my son, or any other children I may have, back there. He will be taken to Ninewells even further afield if need be, but NEVER back there. I sincerely hope their attitudes change, and that no one else has to go through the nightmare we had to with our first baby. Thankfully we did get out and home, and have managed to bond extremely well despite what has happened.", "Dear new mum\r\nYour story is very distressing.

To cut a long story short, I was visiting every night after work and I went in on Saturday evening visiting to be told that she has been discharged and can go home.I was shocked as the staff had previously been told that she lives alone and is 81 and has a bit of dementia.  \r\nI had no clothes with me to take her home, plus her house had not been made ready for her return, as we had been told that she would be in ward 12 for a few weeks moving from ward 10. She ended up in ward 11 confusing I know. I also informed the staff that she would be unable to get up the stairs in her house to the bedroom and toilet, and occupational health had been in contact with me to arrange some equipment she would need when she goes home - so they re-admitted her.  \r\nI tried contacting occupational health over the weekend with no joy left messages, but had no returned call. On Monday, I had a voice message on my mobile phone to get in contact with ward 11 about my mother but nothing to worry about. I contacted the hospital to be told to come and collect my mother, as she has been discharged. I told the nurse that occupational health had not contacted me about the situation. The nurse listened then said I would still have to collect my mother, so I said I will be later on as I have just returned from work and had to collect clothes from her house. I said to the nurse she will not be able to make it up the stairs, the nurse replied that she had had a full assessment done and she can go up stairs and wash and dress her self. I said well that's a quick recovery as the other day at visiting my wife had to assist her to the ward toilet with no stairs.  \r\nWe got her things together and the nurse handed us her medication, I said she will not be able to remember to take this, the nurse replied that's ok, we have arranged for the district nurse to come in and give her the injection and pain killers. Fine, I said, that's good and off we went.  \r\nI went to my mothers tonight after work to find that the nurse has not returned to administer the medication and injection, or to change or check the dressing from operation. So I called ward 11 and asked about the district nurse, the staff nurse told me no one would be out at this time of night (17. 30!) and said she would call me back as the nurses are on their tea break. I said who is going to give her the injection as I am not trained and my mother can't. I knew this would happen and await her call.", "Dear Gerrevelyn\r\nI was very concerned to read your post and have discussed your concerns with the Chief of Nursing Services.

The symptoms of this illness cause lesions and scores and skin peeling all over her body including her digestive system and there isn't a cure for it.  \r\nHer skin has to be covered by special dressings. There is set method in the way these dressings are removed and replaced. If done incorrectly then this produces extreme pain and discomfort to my daughter. Therefore it a properly trained nurse is required to attend her home to change the dressings.  \r\nShe attends the Oldham Royal hospital for treatment and she also attends St. Thomas hospital for her skin disease problem with a P.A. as she can not travel unaided as she is classed as disabled.  \r\nMy daughter also has psychological problems due to this illness and she has had suicide attempts in the past and she still thinks life is hopeless and not worth living. She also doesn't trust people easily. She's got depression and she's got fears about being in public places because her disease impacts on her self image and self-esteem. She goes to her GP's clinic only for a very important purpose. She goes to see her consultant in London every six or three months., and her dentist in Birmingham every six months. Most of her time she spends in her room.  \r\nI have written this information to give you some back ground knowledge about my daughter, so you understand her position.  \r\nA District Nurse came to change her dressings in August 2015. Unfortunately the nurse did not do this correctly and caused my daughter to bleed from open wounds and put her in tremendous pain and discomfort. This got to the point where she could not stand it any more and snapped. She left the lounge and went into the kitchen where she obtained a knife and headed for her bedroom where she wanted to kill her self to stop the pain she was in. I chased after her and took the knife from her. This is difficult for to do as I am also very badly disabled.  \r\nThe district nurse was sat on my bed settee and never left the room. At no time was she threatened or her life put in danger. The nurse left soon after this incident. My point is this, if the nurse had the job correctly then none of this would have happened.  \r\nThe outcome of this was that the nurse reported back to senior management informing them that she had been threatened with a knife (which was totally untrue). The District Nursing organisation then insisted that two nurses would attend along with a police woman to make sure of the nurses safety.  \r\nAt first my daughter refused because to have her wounds dressed she had to undress and because of her affliction did not want to do this in front of a non medical person and the embarrassment she felt by the way she looked. After I had a long talk to my daughter and pointed out that once the police officer knew there was no danger to the nurses then she would stop coming. My daughter agreed to this and I informed the nursing staff.  \r\nThere has been no visits to my home by any nursing staff since this incident, a qualified nurse can change the required dressings in about an hour. If I have to do it then it takes me hours and at the end I am really very tired and need to rest. I have to change my daughter dressings at least three times a week. I'm as I have already stated very disabled and have careers.  \r\nTo go back to the knife incident, the whole thing was witnessed by my cleaner who was in the kitchen the whole time as she was doing the ironing. She has made a written statement regarding what she saw and heard. One other point I should make is that the nurse kept on telling my daughter that some one else should change the dressings. I told her to drop this subject as I could see it was upsetting my daughter but she ignored my request. My daughter needs a proper qualified nurse who knows what she is doing to remove and replace the required dressings.  \r\nAll I want for my daughter is her legal rights and be properly looked after. Therefore I turn to you for your help to get what my daughter what she justly deserves.", "After having a severe panic/anxiety attack at my doctor's and admitting that I was suicidal and have suffered from depression from childhood I have been to see so many people and sent from one to another, being accused of been a alcoholic by doctor's as I am not.  \r\nI was sent for CBT and to Fieldhead Hospital.  \r\nI am now poor, homeless, suicidal and at the end.

In that time I was not kept safe and was sexually and financially exploited by another patient on Lillie Ward, had my confidentiality broken by a Consultant Psychiatrist and was stripped for years of any dignity and respect.  \r\nI was consistently ignored by staff, was generally only given escorted when I nagged for it ( so I gave up nagging which meant I never received it) and was treated as a diagnosis rather then a UNIQUE human being.  \r\nI can honestly say, sadly, that the biggest place I have received the greatest stigma for my mental health was by staff inside the mental health system itself. My crisis plan says that if I get seriously mentally ill again and I am to be admitted to a 'safe' place it would be to Hammersmith and Fulham unit - but I have been so traumatised by my experiences I would rather die then be 'cared for' in that hospital ever again.  \r\nIt stripped me and my life of anything that was beautiful. Because of the visiting times my friends couldn't see me, they was no nature, no trees or flowers, there was nothing to do and noone to talk to except other patients.  \r\nSo it is the other patients I thank for their care and compassion that they gave when in my view staff were giving none.", "My partner is depressed and has been on and off for 6 years, every time it comes back around he is worse than the previous time. He has been to his gp multiple times who has referred him to a 'crisis team' and a 'locality team' both have done assessments where he has scored 25/28, both giving feedback to his gp saying he needs urgent help and is at risk, his gp has basically come back to us saying he is too high of a risk for the locality team but not high even risk for the crisis team so no one knows what to do with him. He was told he would receive a phone call in the future at some point from some one. How do medical professionals think that is acceptable to say to a suicidal depressed individual? That someone will help you at some point but we have no idea when, or how. He was told by each 'proffesional' that he needed an urgent plan of action.... So where is it? He is now getting worse as he feels abandoned by the system and feels like it is failing once again (he has tried several times down this route over the 6 years, each forgetting about him, regardless of how many times he perseveres with the gp). They just bounce him back between assessments with the crisis and locality team and gp check ups but we have not reached a point where he is told about or given any kind of action plan or treatment. My partner is worse than he has ever been and struggles to believe that he has any chance of getting better due to these experiences we keep having.

We rang 999 and the ambulance arrived at 4. 30pm after Mum had spent an hour and a half on the floor. She had a very deep wound to her leg and pain in her other foot, she had lost alot of blood and was extremely confused. The ambulance left at 5. 12pm. She arrived at A&E at 6. 50pm even though her house is only 30 minutes from the hospital.  \r\nMy mother was left on a trolley then for 4 1/2 hours with an open wound. The cut had not been dressed at all. There were lumps of her flesh on the trolley and on the floor. She was eventually seen by an extremely rude doctor who neither looked at her or myself and only spoke when I spoke to him. The wound was stitched and then Mum was left for a further 3 hours on the trolley before she was finally taken to a ward at 2. 30 a. m. She was agitated and extremely confused. None of the staff had been interested in whether she had dementia and whether it was safe for her to be left alone. She had during this time been taken for an X-Ray and had I not gone with her she would have been left in a dark, deserted corridor for almost an hour.  \r\nShe was taken to MEAU. When I visited her there the next day she was sat in a chair. Her bed had one thin (about a cm thick) pillow which I think was from the trolley the night before and only the covers from the trolley she had come in with. She had no blankets on the bed and a nylon sheet. There were still lumps of her flesh on the bed, on the floor and stuck to her slippers.  \r\nThe staff I saw were unhelpful and acted uninterested and uncaring. The lady in the next bed to Mum had been calling for a nurse for at least 30 minutes. I went to the Nurse's Station twice and asked that someone come as the lady was asking for the toilet. No-one at the station bothered to look up or even acknowledge me. The only comment was that she had just been to the toilet. No-one came. Finally the lady lifted her nightie to show me. She was soiled from her knees to her waist. Still no-one came. Finally a very kind lady who was serving lunch fetched a member of staff.  \r\nThe lady on the other side of Mum needed feeding. A woman came to do this and shovelled 2 or 3 spoonfuls into her mouth. The old lady was on her side, clearly in much pain and clinging to the bars of the bed. The woman who was feeding her never spoke only to tell the old lady to \"Cover her mouth when she coughed\". She showed this vulnerable old lady neither care or respect. The woman then stopped feeding her. A cup of tea was left on her trolley and we had to tell a member of staff that the lady needed help as she couldn't reach it herself.  \r\nMy mother was not offered any lunch and when I asked why I was told she wasn't on the list for lunch. My mother thought she had to pay for lunch so didn't ask for any. Had I not been there she wouldn't have eaten.  \r\nThe nurse on duty knew nothing about my Mum's condition. She didn't know that she had a stitched wound on her leg. She didn't know which foot had fractures in it.  \r\nThe entire ward seemed full of staff in all different uniforms but not one of them seemed to care for any of the poor souls left on that ward.  \r\nI left the hospital feeling totally disgusted, saddened and depressed.

Trusts are meant to provide crisis plans specific to the individual patient and to update them regularly under the care programme approach. For 16 months the only 'new' plan they provided merely stated that I should call my CMHT, call my GP and call the crisis team out of hours. This plan was written informally by a manager in an email to me. It was less detailed than the entirely generic crisis advice provided on the Rethink Mental Illness website. It could hardly be described as an 'individualised' crisis plan. TEWV failed in my view to follow the NICE guidelines for joint crisis planning. I sent my care team more detailed information that could be part of a crisis plan but no changes were made for 16 months and, as far as I'm aware, the crisis plan on my record was 2 years out-of-date before my care team finally updated it - a task that took them only half an hour.  \r\nIf I had solely raised this matter with a care co-ordinator it might, perhaps, be understandable that no action was taken for so long but I even raised it with the then Director of Nursing and Governance. For 16 months my crisis plan was not updated despite me attending many appointments. I even offered alternative methods of contact like email and phone if the frequency of appointments was not leaving time to deal with issues I consider a priority such as a crisis plan, but my crisis plan remained generic and outdated. In my opinion, patients ought to be able to expect better crisis planning from a Mental Health Trust that claims to be committed to the Crisis Care Concordat.  \r\nAn individualised crisis plan is really important to me. In the past I have been affected by lack of adequate crisis planning. On one occasion I missed 2 appointments and this was not seen as a warning sign. Even though it was unusual for me the mental health team simply planned to discharge me. Very soon afterwards I was an emergency admission under the Mental Health Act and hospitalised for 6 months. On another occasion I was acutely depressed. I contacted my care co-ordinator saying I had immediate suicide plans but no effective preventative action was taken. That night I was on life support and was in a coma for nearly a week then in hospital for a month. If it were not for my lack of medical knowledge at that time then I would have died.  \r\nTEWV's lack of crisis planning has left me feeling scared, at risk and increasingly hopeless about my future should I relapse. I am bewildered why Trusts don't learn lessons before tragedies rather than claiming they intend to learn them when it is already too late. I also feel angry that in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, and with all the knowledge and research there is about crisis prevention, ordinary service users are still not receiving adequate crisis planning from a Trust that the CQC rates as 'Good'"]}}; }
